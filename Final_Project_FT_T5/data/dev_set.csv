955757,thesun,"CLIMATE change has been a touchy topic of conversation more than ever before, and unless tackled quickly, it can destroy the planet we live on.

But is climate change reversible and is it caused by humans? Here's what we know.

Last year, Sir David Attenborough warned that climate change will destroy civilisation unless it is tackled quickly.

His ominous message was delivered to world leaders at the United Nations’ environmental talks in Poland.

He warned: “Right now, we are facing a man-made disaster of global scale. Our greatest threat in thousands of years. Climate change. “If we don’t take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon."" Greenhouse gas emissions must be slashed by 45 per cent by 2030 to hit the target. The World Bank has pledged £157billion over five years to support countries taking action against climate change. Climate change can be reversed if immediate action is taken. Is it the same as global warming? Global warming describes a set of changes to the climate that is causing the Earth to heat up. This rising of the Earth's temperature is often talked about in the context of the ""greenhouse effect"" to explain the damage being wreaked on our planet. Without the greenhouse effect the Earth's surface would be an average of about 60 degrees Fahrenheit cooler, and therefore unlivable. The effect allows gases in but keeps heat from escaping from the earth, like the glass walls of a greenhouse. Greenhouse gases are believed to be higher now than in the last 650,000 years Is it caused by humans? Over the past century humans have aggravated the greenhouse effect by dramatically increasing the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Human sources of CO2 come from activities such as deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas. Since the Industrial Revolution the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has rocketed by a third. This rapid rise has had a direct impact on the Earth's average temperature, with potentially catastrophic consequences. In December 2018, a study ""comprehensively disproved"" the ""myth"" of a pause in global warming that took supposedly place between 1995 and 2013. This period – believed to have lasted a decade and a half – was held up as evidence that humans might not be causing significant climate change. Dr James Risbey, of CSIRO Australia, lead author on one of the studies, said: ""Many studies over the past decade have claimed to find a pause or slowdown in global warming and have typically posited this as evidence that is inconsistent with our understanding of global warming."" Last year, Sir David Attenborough warned that climate change will destroy civilisation unless it is tackled quickly What effect is it having on earth? The rise in the average global temperature has already had a demonstrable impact. Greenhouse gases are believed to be higher now than in the last 650,000 years. Melting glaciers, rising sea levels and dying cloud forests have all been directly linked to climate change. Humans too are already suffering directly - with deadly heatwaves and catastrophic flooding becoming a regular occurrence.

973081,thesun,"A SPACE fan with the middle names Aldrin Armstrong turns 50 today — on the anniversary of the Moon landing.

Mark Kimberley was born within hours of Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong’s “giant leap” in 1969.

Parents Bill and Una gave him the extra name Anthony at first.

But as the success of the Apollo 11 mission, also manned by Michael Collins, gripped the world they switched to Aldrin Armstrong.

Mark said: “I’m really proud of my name. It’s certainly an icebreaker.”

The dad-of-three hopes to meet Aldrin, 89, and is seeking Nasa’s permission to have its initials inked on his arms.

He added: “I want to get a tattoo of the astronauts’ names, and an image of them planting the US flag.”

The mechanic, of Chelmsley Wood, West Mids, was bought a “patch of moon” by daughter Tania, 30, although his family admits: “It wouldn’t mean much in a court of law!”

Growing up he was dubbed Space Cadet and liked to confuse police.

He said: “I had a white Ford Capri and police would always pull me over. I’d tell them my names and birth date. They’d think it was a wind-up.”

He owns a Haynes’ engineering manual for Apollo 11, Moon landing coins and The Sun’s commemorative poster.

Wife Sharon, 48, also mum to Mark Jr, 24, and Daniel, 21, said: “Mark’s names are a real talking point. We’d love Nasa to know about them.”",Space fan celebrates 50th on Moon landing anniversary — and he’s named ‘Aldrin Armstrong’,human interest,anniversary,227
503480,sottnet,"The community of viruses is staggeringly vast. Occupying every conceivable biological niche, from searing undersea vents to frigid tundra, these enigmatic invaders, hovering between inert matter and life, circumnavigate the globe in the hundreds of trillions. They are the most abundant life forms on earth.Viruses are justly feared as ingenious pathogens, causing diseases in everything they invade, including virtually all bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. Recent advances in the field of virology, however, suggest thatWe now know that humans contain roughly 100,000 pieces of viral DNA elements, which make up around 8 percent of our genome. Speculation on the role of these ancient viral fragments ranges from protection against disease to increasing the risk of cancer or other serious illnesses, though researchers acknowledge they have barely scratched the surface of this enigmaA new review article appearing in the journal Nature Reviews Microbiology highlights the evolution and ecology of plant viruses. Arvind Varsani, a researcher at ASU's Biodesign Institute joins an international team to explore many details of viral dynamics. They describe the subtle interplay between three components of the viral infection process, the virus itself, the plant cell hosts infected by the virus and the vectors that act as go-betweens — an intricate system evolving over some 450 million years. All three elements are embedded within wider relations of the surrounding ecosystem.,"" Varsani says. "". We have a section where we review mutualism and symbiosis and also how some of the symbiotic relationships are being uncoupled.""In 1892, Dmitry Ivanovsky, a Russian botanist, conducted a simple experiment that would have momentous implications for science and medicine. He collected sap from a diseased tobacco plant, fed the substance through very fine pores and showed that this filtered fluid could infect a healthy tobacco plant. The filtering ensured that whatever the disease-causing entity was, it was tinier than a bacterium. A Dutch plant specialist and microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck dubbed the mysterious pathogenic substance a virus, though its true form — invisible to light microscopy — only appeared in 1931, with the invention of the electron microscope. A rod-shaped plant invader, known as tobacco mosaic virus, had revealed itself — the first virus on record. Since this time, thousands of distinct species have been identified, yet they represent a tiny fraction of the viral universe, most of which remains unexplored.""The way I look at viruses now is from a philosophical angle,"" Varsani says. ""They are a dynamic entity and they have multiple lifestyles, ranging from basic, where the virus is fully reliant on the host for replication, to some cases where it's only partly reliant on the host."" Because some viruses can evolve so rapidly, trading and acquiring new genetic elements, their genomes can become chimeric or even fragmented, making their proper classification a serious challenge for the field of virology.From the standpoint of ecology, plant viruses are particularly important for a number of reasons. Plants make up over 80 percent of the biomass on earth, exerting a greater impact on the planet's diverse ecosystems than viruses infecting other kingdoms of life. Plant viruses have obvious importance for food crops and ornamental plants, and a range of viruses are responsible for an estimated $60 billion in crop losses worldwide each year.To capture the astonishing richness of the planet's viral universe, researchers have gone beyond early methods of pinpointing individual virus particles and analyzing them. Techniques of metaviromics are used to probe environments for the full panoply of viruses they contain. The method, which relies on piecing together multiple DNA or RNA genomes from environmental samples, has been recently used to identify vast numbers of previously undocumented viruses. In the case of plant viruses, these viral fragments are often extracted from the insect vectors that ferry the viruses from plant to plant.Metaviromic sequencing is a particularly powerful technique for investigating viral communities. Unlike cellular life, which has a single, common origin,. While common protein motifs have been observed in viral capsids, these are likely the result of convergent evolution or horizontal gene transfer, rather than inherited elements.The strategy of metaviromics is particularly useful for teasing out mutualistic relationships between plants, vectors and viruses and their changing relationships over time. As so much research since the inception of virology has been focused on viruses as disease-causing agents in humans and plants, the nature and degree of mutualistic interactions between viruses, vectors and hosts is most likely underrepresented.The authors speculate that virusesby limiting the growth of genetically homogeneous plants, including crops. New studies of viral ecology seek to understand the extent and importance of both pathogenic and mutualistic interactions. An all-important link in the chain of infection is the behavior of particular insect vectors and their modes of viral transmission, though numerous other factors come into play, including nutrients, water resources, heat and cold stress, and adverse soil conditions.Vectors play an outsized role in the world of plant viruses.It is believed that the mode of viral transmission plays a role in the virus' effect on its host. If the virus is transmitted via seeds or pollen, the virus should limit its harmful effect on the reproductive success of the host plant, perhaps even conveying an adaptive advantage over uninfected plants.The viral passage from parent to daughter plant is known as vertical transmission. By contrast, horizontal viral transmission occurs when insect vectors transit the virus from plant to plant. Such vector-borne assaults can be more merciless to the infected plant and only need ensure their continued spread to a suitable number of healthy plants for the virus to be successful.Many kinds of vectors can transmit plant viruses, including arachnids, fungi, nematodes, and some protists, though more than 70 percent of known plant viruses are transmitted by insects, most from the biological order Hemiptera, which includes cicadas, aphids, planthoppers, leafhoppers and shield bugs.Insects of this kind can make use of mouthparts constructed for piercing and extracting sap or plant cell material. Insect transmission of plant viruses can occur through excretion of virus particles in saliva following feeding on an infected plant. Alternately, the plant virus can become permanently incorporated into the insect's salivary glands, allowing the vector to transmit the virus to new plants throughout the insect's lifetime.Intriguingly, a number of insect-transmitted plant viruses may have evolved mechanisms to influence vector behavior, making infected plants more attractive to sap-feeding insects or ensuring that infected plants produce chemicals that promote insect behaviors that help facilitate transmission.Plant viruses display considerable ingenuity in their strategies, which are highly dependent on their given environment. Some are generalists, invading multiple species, while other viruses are specialists that favour a narrow range of plant hosts. This selectivity may develop with time, through a process known as adaptive radiation. This typically occurs when a virus faces a heterogeneous habitat and becomes adaptively specialized to exploit particular ecological resources while becoming maladapted to exploit others. Such specialization acts to limit competition between different viral lineages or species. Alternatively, generalist viruses infect multiple plant hosts but must compete for these resources with other viruses. This situation tends to result in a viral population of low diversity dominated by the most acutely adapted viral genotypes.While researchers agree that viruses lack a single common ancestor,. Three common hypotheses compete for dominance as an explanatory framework, though they are not mutually exclusive. Perhaps viruses evolved from free-living cells, as the devolution or regressive hypothesis states. They could also have originated from RNA and DNA molecules that somehow escaped from living cells. Alternatively, viruses may have once existed as self-replicating entities that evolved alongside cells, eventually losing their independent status.Ongoing metaviromic research of viral diversity is helping to uncover foundational relationships among viruses and pinpoint common origins among many plant, fungal and arthropod viruses. Of particular concern for the future are the ways in which human-caused disruptions to ecosystems across the planet, which are occurring at rates unprecedented in earth's history, are reforming virus, vector and host relationships.The effects of these disruptions may be to foster emergent viruses with heightened abilities to cause disease in their hosts. As ecological communities become more tightly interwoven through changes in human land use, existing interaction networks that have acted over evolutionary time to stabilize host relations with native vectors and viruses can suddenly shift. Any lethal entity entering this kind of disrupted ecosystem is much likelier to rapidly spread through the population and aggressively sweep through different organisms. The future health and sustainability of both human and plant populations will benefit from an improved understanding of the many subtle interrelationships governing the most ubiquitous viruses — those colonizing plants.",Plant viruses may be essential for maintaining biodiversity and helping plants adapt to their environment,health,non-human diseases,1424
477956,russiainsider,"Vertigo Politix is a YouTuber who makes short, detailed videos explaining aspects of the West's current problems. In the video below he summarizes how Jewish elites have deliberately undermined the culture and morals of whites in Europe and America, especially through changes in immigration policies.

Jewish elites, the true “deep state” behind the curtain and facade of “democracy“, are carrying out genocide primarily through mass non-White invasion (labeled as “migration”) but also through the promotion of feminism, miscegenation, abortion, homosexuality, gender dysphoria, etc.

In addition, to facilitate the effects of such dysgenic factors, these elites have subjected Whites to — over generations now — psychological warfare, through their control over the media, education, etc., to induce White guilt and self-hate.

The ultimate aim of these programs is to bring about a World Order ruling over former White countries, that will have been turned into multi-racial brown skinned, dysfunctional societies, no longer able to resist  tyranny.

Immigration is a form of demographic genocide, which either by design, or consequence, results in ethnic cleansing. In addition to this Western governments are effacing their European populations by promoting a variety of other schemes such as miscegenation, abortion, homosexuality, gender dysphoria, and White guilt.

But immigration has been, by far, the most successful approach towards complete replacement. And if this does not drastically change within the next two decades, Europeans will be the first race to become extinct.

So who within the political class is behind immigration policy? And how have they been able to coercively open the floodgates?

Whether the discussion begins with the Diaspora after the Bar Kokhba revolt, or seeks to understand the role played by fifth columns during the fall of the Visigothic Kingdom to Muslim forces, in 711 AD, there has been a continuous thread, over some 2,000 years, of a jewish influence within the lands inhabited by Europeans that has sought to undermine the integrity of cultural boundaries, and more crucially, the conception of borders.

Through traitorous invitation, political realignments, or financial legerdemain, these alien forces have often contrived the social conditions and historical circumstances where kingdoms and nations went to war, peoples fled their homelands, and for those caught in between, a life of brutal misery.

In such a frustrating and vicious cycle, a continuous pressure has been placed upon the European race! Never has a group of people being so crushed over such a length of time! Even the Asian and African kingdoms had centuries of relative peace here and there. But for simple Europeans, generally speaking a farming culture, which had natural ties to the land and each other, the past 2,000 years has been a nightmare!

In the grist mill of the present era, we have observable evidence of a Judeo-globalist conspiracy to open Western countries to the importation of countless non-White peoples, whose sheer numbers will out-produce the native European populations.

This current state of affairs can be traced back to the mid 1960s when, in just a few short years, every Western state changed — without any popular consent — the laws governing immigration policy. In every case jewish leadership was responsible for these changes. The resultant breakup of the dominant, homogeneous, traditional European culture, ensured that a small rank-and-file coterie maintained it’s grip over Western nations, by excluding any possibility of a larger racially European competitive group from rising to positions of influence..

Moreover, the social stability within many European nations gradually became compromised as the original ethno-fabric unwound, creating greater mechanisms of control against the native populations, which further reinforced the absolute dominance by this coterie, over state and culture.

The following is a short list of Western nations who adopted these democidal immigration policies after 1960, and the jewish ringleaders behind these efforts.

Senator Jacob Javits played a prominent role in the Senate hearings for the 1965 bill. Javits authored an article entitled “Let’s Open the Gates” in which a proposed immigration level of 500,000 people per year for 20 years was requested, with no restrictions on national origin. Congressman Emanuel Celler who had fought for unrestricted immigration since the 1920s in the House of Representatives, was the main writer of the legislation.

Leo Pfeffer who wrote many treatises and books that acted as softening propaganda for open immigration also co-conceived the legislated material.

Norman Podhoretz was a former communist, Comintern sympathizer, turned neocon who became a close associate of the upper mentioned men. He wrote numerous articles promoting open immigration. And jewish organizations, such as, the American jewish Congress, the jewish Federation, the ACLU, and B’nai B’rith, all filed briefs in support of open immigration before the senate sub-committee during the hearings prior to the Hart-Celler Act.

Walter Lippman played a crucial role in pressuring the Holt government to do away with racial profiling against non-White immigration. He was President of the Australian jewish Welfare Society, which among other services, offered financial support and housing to non-White immigrants to Australia.

John Malcolm Fraser was a cabinet member during the Holt government who went on to become the Prime Minister of Australia in 1975.

His mother’s maiden name was Wolff, born of a South African jew who emigrated to Australia. Despite being Minister of the war cabinet, his Liberal Party values did not stop him from advising on an easing of immigration restrictions. This sympathy no doubt gave him a leg up on his competitors when he campaigned for Prime Minister, a decade later.

The Labour Party, true to its Marxist roots, began a series of Nationality acts from 1948 onward, that established the rule of “jus soli”, whereby citizens of the British Commonwealth could now migrate to Britain.

Ralph Miliband was born in the jewish quarter of Warsaw. He emigrated to England in 1940.

After the war he joined the Labour Party, despite his hatred for English culture, and proceeded to become an intellectual proponent of the New Left. His writings and lectures proved influential in the reworking of several British Nationality Acts over the decades, as they became increasingly more open to non-White immigration.

Maurice Edelman was a lifelong member of British Parliament. He was a Francophile, an admirer of David Ben Gurion. His efforts over the years as a Labour Party MP included a number of published works, several of which sought to influence how Britons saw themselves. Like many of his ilk, he considered the peoples of Britain to be the ancestors of migrants.

Canada, Germany, Sweden, France, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, and so many others, also had major overhauls to their national immigration policies during the same period.

The mainstream narrative explained this phenomenon as a development of lower birth rates among natural Europeans. Then there was a financial reasoning behind the influx, one which argued the fallacy that Western countries had a desperate shortage of low-skilled workers.

And now the latest explanation for mass emigration has been given, that Europeans need to become more diverse, despite the demonstrable fact that about 97% of all hair colors, and 96% of all eye colours attributed to human beings belong exclusively to the European haplogroup, the explanation that we are never given is simply this:

That an internationalist cartel, operating within Western nations, has designs on governing the planet at some point in the future. They have shared this common goal since the age of revolution, and this in part helps explain why their long-term plans always go unnoticed, because they think in terms of centuries, while Europeans can only see from one generation to the next.

And it matters not what one calls them, liberal, globalist, socialist, communist, cultural Marxist, or jewry! In toto, they are one in the same. They desire a one world cultural order, ruled by a centrally controlled government, with all of humanity under it’s thumb. And for them, European nationalism since 1848, has been a barrier to that goal. Therefore, Europeans must simply be replaced!

This philosophical point is essential to understanding their religion, or globalism. Much of the world already operates in some manner like it, but conditionally, on a micro level.

A subsistence version of it, a pseudo communism, if you will, due to poverty in Africa, culture in China, or caste systems in India.

However the individuality and free-spirited nature of Europeans, and their ability to organize and express these traits through cultural celebration, or nationalism, is a roadblock to world government. Even when given various forms of socialism to live by, many European cultures could just not adapt collectively, or metaphysically, to it.

And once it becomes understood that the purest form of this doctrine, communism, was simply a jewish designed belief system to persuade Gentiles to abandon the notion of property rights, relinquish their free will to an authority that ruled over them, and divorced themselves from the values of their culture, and kindred, in as much as they related to the state, then it makes perfect sense why the Europeans have stubbornly held their ground through dozens of the world’s greatest social cataclysms, of which the Bolshevik Revolution, and World Wars were only a part.

And now the final push looms large! An army of culturally alien, hostile peoples, have been brought into our midst! Many of whom are males of military age. They want to pair up and breed with native European women, which our elected governments offer up to them. They want their own laws and cultural norms to be dominant! They defile our religious and historical spaces, while waiting for the day when Western governments finally say to them:

And to think that it all began with just a few modest initiatives, some cosmetic changes to our immigration policy only a few short decades ago. When a man like Enoch Powell could deliver a speech that still meant something.

71898,breitbart,"The paper’s dismissal of economics is buried deep in a long and critical article about Trump’s immigration policy and his top aide, Steven Miller. The dismissal allows the article to comply with the August 12 instructions from the NYT‘s senior editor who urged reporters to treat public debates over immigration policy as racial conflicts, not as disputes over money, wages, salaries, profits, and stock prices.

The article’s subheadline claims the nation’s immigration policy is now driven by hostility towards individual immigrants, not by the widespread public opposition to the painful economic distortions caused by the government’s support for mass migration:  “Behind Mr. Miller’s singular grip on the Trump anti-immigrant agenda are forces far bigger than [Miller’s] own hostility toward the foreign-born.”

The NYT reporter, Jason DeParle, dismissed the public’s concerns about jobs, wages, and housing prices with a few vague sentences crediting unnamed “economists”:

Yet DeParle’s admission of “greater downward pressure” indirectly admits that immigration does exert some downward pressure on wages. His mention of “other forces” also hides the indirect economic effect of mass immigration, such as companies’ ability to break unions by hiring refugees and illegal migrants for jobs in meatpacking, construction, and restaurants.

DeParle also cited the misleading summary issued by the National Academies of Science to cover up the dynamite results of its 643-page, landmark study of immigration economics in 2016. DeParle wrote:

But the summary by the National Academies downplays the data and statements in the report which admit that imported workers cut Americans’ wages.

For example, on page 171 of its September 2016 report, the academies’ experts agreed to a formula which shows that immigration imposes a 5.2 percent income tax on Americans:

The NAS panel declined to state the dollar value of the 5.2 percent immigration tax. But panel member George Borjas, a Harvard economist, calculated the value of the tax at $500 billion a year.

This $500 billion immigration tax is not paid to the government — it is paid by employees to employers and investors who gain whenever wages are lowered by the increased supply of workers jostling and competing for wages. That’s a political boon for Democrats because economic pressure tends to push Americans to vote for the big-spending party.

The immigration tax of $500 billion is a huge loss for the many American families who are already hurt by automation and globalization, by the rising cost of education, housing, childcare and healthcare, and by Wall Street’s constant pressure for spending cuts and payroll curbs. Small wonder that many Americans feel under intense economic pressure to vote for the big-spending  giveaway Democrat Party.

On page 242, the NAS report also showed 18 studies which describe the wage losses caused by the government’s policy of importing labor:

“The evidence suggests that groups comparable to the immigrants in terms of their skill may experience a wage reduction as a result of immigration-induced increases in labor supply, although there are still a number of studies that suggest small to zero effects,” the report said on page 248.

The NAS report also hides the impact of immigration on wages by arguing that wages will rise once the economy expands to provide jobs for all the immigrants, so forcing employers to start paying fair market wages. The summary said, “When measured over a period of ten years or more, the impact of immigration on the wages of natives overall is very small.”

But the problem with NAS ten-year claim is that the long-run never arrives because the government keeps providing roughly 1 million more new legal immigrants each year, plus a population of roughly 1.5 million visa-workers, at least 2 million people with work permits, plus at least 8 million working illegals.

When asked, many economists and even business groups quickly — but reluctantly — admit that wages are cut by the government’s policy of boosting the labor supply with migrants. Breitbart News has extensively covered those admissions.

The Senate’s 2013 “Gang of Eight” immigration bill would have shifted more of the nation’s new wealth from employees over to investors, according to the 2013 study of the bill by the Congressional Budget Office. “The rate of return on capital would be higher [than on labor] under the legislation than under current law throughout the next two decades,” says the report, titled “The Economic Impact of S. 744.”

The CBO report also repeated the NAS claim that wages would rise once the economy eventually provides jobs for all the new immigrants. “Average wages would be slightly lower than under current law through 2024, primarily because the amount of capital available to workers would not increase as rapidly as the number of workers and because the new workers would be less skilled and have lower wages, on average, than the labor force under current law,” the CBO said. But the promise of a future rise in wages would be dashed if the government again expanded immigration.

In 2016, many establishment media out and staffers for Hillary Clinton’s campaign touted a study by the Wall Street advisory firm Moody’s Analytics. The study said that candidate Donald Trump’s promise to deport migrant labor would raise Americans’ salaries: “As the immigrants leave, the already-tight labor market will get tighter, pushing up labor costs as employers struggle to fill the open job positions. … Mr. Trump’s immigration policies will thus result in… potentially severe labor shortages, and higher labor costs.”

In 2016, Moody’s reported that the deportation of illegals in Arizona spiked Americans’ wages:

The business school at the University of Pennsylvania has issued several reports say that less immigration will slow the expansion of the economy. When pressed by Breitbart News, the group’s leader, economic professor Kent Smetters, admitted that Trump’s 2017 immigration reduction plan would raise Americans’ wages for the next 33 years: “By 2027, wages increase a small amount (0.231%) relative to baseline; by 2040, wages increase by an even smaller amount (0.158%).” The school is backed by several investors who stand to gain from an increased inflow of consumers and cheap workers.

In February 2018, former treasury secretary Robert Rubin told a D.C. meeting at his Hamilton Project that wages rose in the 1990s because there was a shortage of workers. “First in the mid-90s, earlyish, and then rest of the 1990s, as we all know, wages increased at a robust level at all quintiles, and that was in some fair measure, due to tight labor markets, which in turn, at least in my, view, were a function in some fair measure, of good policy.” Rubin’s resume includes 26 years at Goldman Sachs, four years as President Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary and ten years running the Citigroup banking firm, during a decades-long period when Americans’ wages were mostly flat.

Foreign economists admit the obvious. The Central Bank of Ireland recently reported that “an increase in inward migration can help to mitigate overheating dynamics in the labour market … Typically, employment growth at or above the “full employment” level is accompanied by strong growth in wages and prices. As the supply of labour is scarce relative to demand, workers’ bargaining power increases and the price of labour increases.”

Business advocates commonly say immigration has little impact on wages — but also that higher immigration can prevent wage raises. For example, the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal wrote in August 2017:

President Barack Obama admitted the obvious several times. For instance, in his January 2016 State of the Union Address, he said: “immigrants aren’t the principal reason wages haven’t gone up enough; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns.” In his 2006 autobiography, Obama wrote “this huge influx of mostly low-skill workers provides some benefits to the economy as a whole… [but] it also threatens to depress further the wages of blue-collar Americans.”

White-collar graduates also lose salaries and careers to immigration, according to a 2013 report by left-of-center academics:

Mass immigration also reduces employees’ income by forcing them to pay more for housing. The impacts include a claimed $3.7 trillion jump in real estate values, and the increased pressure by elites on other Americans to reduce the “single-family zoning” rules which created suburbia. The same supply and demand factor operates in Ireland, where the Central Bank reported that “Higher migration, however, also increases the demand for housing putting upward pressure on house prices

But the impact is especially clear outside the New York Times‘ front door, where local residents blocked the arrival of Amazon because it would spike rental costs: “An analysis conducted in April by Zillow found that renters’ costs could increase by more than $200 annually in the two cities relative to the real-estate site’s base cases if Amazon were to set up in them,” Business Insider reported November 2018.  In August 2019, the Daily Mail showed how one New York landlord split one apartment lengthwise into nine spaces of five-foot-high rooms, each renting for $600 per month.

The immigration-fueled real-estate growth along the costs is also helping to slow economic growth in America’s heartland. Coastal investors have little need to hire young workers in distant Kansas, Oklahoma or Kentucky because the government keeps flying new foreign workers into Los Angeles, New York, North Carolina, New Jersey, Florida, and Seattle.

This huge shift in population, and the resulting drop in wages has pushed the coastal states further and further into the Democrat columns on election day. In contrast, the GOP does well with young people who can afford homes and families in states with fewer migrants and small wealth gaps.

But DeParle’s effort to dismiss the impact of the economic impact of mass migration complies with his newspaper’s new race-before-money editorial policy.

The policy was described August 12 by executive editor Dean Baquet in a closed-door meeting with reporters and editors, when he said the newspaper is going to focus on the impact of slavery and racism throughout American politics during the runup to the 2020 elections. The public’s worries about migration’s impact wages are to be treated in the same fashion as articles about Fox News, on “anti-immigrant conspiracies,” or religious opposition to abortion, he said:

Even if immigration has no impact on wages and rents, the New York Times article collides with the reality that Trump has repeatedly said he wants to welcome immigrants to the new jobs in his go-go economy. “We want to allow millions of people to come in . . . We have to have legal immigration, not illegal immigration,” Trump said August 7:

The NYT article is not entirely off-base. For example, it does admit that Breitbart’s follow-the-money coverage of the immigration issue has had an impact on Americans’ politics, saying “right-wing populism had long flourished on talk radio, but Breitbart, with few restrictions on space, could cover the issue in greater depth, bringing intense scrutiny to hot-button issues.”

Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or university. This total includes about 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or health care, engineering or science, software, or statistics.

But the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of roughly 1.5 million white-collar visa workers — including approximately 1 million H-1B workers and spouses — and about 500,000 blue-collar visa workers.

The government also prints out more than one million work permits for foreigners, tolerates about eight million illegal workers, and does not punish companies for employing the hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants who sneak across the border or overstay their legal visas each year.

This policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth for investors because it transfers wages to investors and ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions.

This policy of flooding the market with cheap, foreign, white-collar graduates and blue-collar labor also shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors, even as it also widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, and hurts children’s schools and college educations.

The cheap-labor economic strategy also pushes Americans away from high-tech careers and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.

The labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the Heartland to the coastal cities, explodes rents and housing costs, undermines suburbia, shrivels real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech, labor-intensive workplaces.",New York Times Hides $$$ to Smear Donald Trump's Policies as 'Anti-Immigrant',society,immigration,1982
18950,aljazeera,"African art has been having a very long moment. Over the past 10 years, contemporary artists from the continent - from the Ghanaian sculptor El Anatsui to Kenyan artist Wangechi Mutu to South African photographer Zanele Muholi - have continued to build their names on the international stage.

African artists have been presenting in major museums and galleries across Europe and the United States, while increasing numbers of African countries have shown at the prestigious Venice Biennale, including Ghana's critically-acclaimed debut this year.
• South African art museum attracts tourists from around the world
• How art can be a force for development in Africa

Both Sotheby's and Bonhams auction houses meanwhile have set up their own African contemporary and modern art departments, signalling that the market is paying attention, too.

""Going into the new decade, I feel we are starting from a stronger foothold,"" said Marwan Zakhem, the founder of Gallery 1957, in Ghana's capital, Accra. ""The international art scene has woken up to the wealth of creativity offered across Africa and the diaspora,"" Zakhem told Al Jazeera.

""A lot of groundwork has been made in terms of affirming African art as a key component of the ever-flourishing arts scene, so it's an exciting time to be a part of it"".

What is most notable, however, is the growth seen within the continent. Addressing a crippling lack of infrastructure that has previously forced talent to look elsewhere for opportunity and support, major cities are bolstering their local scenes while establishing themselves as international art destinations.

Art fairs have popped up to seduce collectors, new residences have given creatives spaces to develop their craft and museums such as Cape Town's Zeitz MOCAA and the Museum of African Contemporary Art Al Maaden (MACAAL) in Marrakech have opened to showcase the best on offer.

""There's still more to be done though,"" Zakhem said. ""I hope the decade ahead sees more continent-wide investment in the visual arts - more museums, more projects, more educational support - and more events bringing international visitors here.""

As the year - and the decade - draws to a close, here are four African art events to watch out for in 2020 and beyond.

Marrakech enters new decade as first African Capital of Culture

Thanks to the opening of MACAAL, 2018's inaugural Moroccan edition of the 1:54 Contemporary African Art Fair and the commercial success of artists such as Hassan Hajjaj - the subject of a recent retrospective at Paris's Maison Europeenne de la Photographie - Marrakech has become a major draw for critics and collectors.

As 2020's African Capital of Culture - the first city to hold the designation - it will no doubt be increasing its efforts to engage art lovers and buyers alike.

""Over the last five years, Marrakech has struck an excellent balance in preserving and building on its rich cultural histories, while establishing itself as a space for artistic experimentation. Alongside this, there is a growing number of commercial spaces and both independent and government funding, giving artists more opportunities to support their practices in the long term,"" said 1:54 founder Touria El Glaoui.

""I grew up in Morocco and my father [Hassan El Glaoui] was a painter who always encouraged us to engage with art histories, so seeing the scene grow and blossom has been amazing to witness.""

In February, 1:54 will return to the city's luxurious La Mamounia hotel for the third year, hosting some 20 European and African galleries. At the same time, MACAAL, the Muse Yves Saint Laurent Marrakech and other local spaces will be staging their own exhibitions, creating an unofficial art week of sorts.

How the rest of the year shapes up will surely set the template for how future cities make use of the Capital of Culture designation.

The birthplace of art stars including Ben Enwonwu - whose Tutu, dubbed the African Mona Lisa, sold for a record $1.6m in 2018 - Victor Ehikhamenor and Njideka Akunyili Crosby, Nigeria is an obvious choise to be the home of West Africa's first international art fair: Art X Lagos.

Launched in 2016 by entrepreneur Tokini Peterside, Art X Lagos serves as an exhibition space, marketplace and classroom for those looking to immerse themselves in the world of contemporary African art.

It is also notable for prioritising younger artists over established pioneers through both its exhibitions and the Access Bank ART X Prize, which awards one emerging artist with funding, mentoring and an international residency.

""I see how wonderful and massive [Art X Lagos] is becoming and I think it's placing Lagos as a real arts hub, which I really love, and a serious one,"" said Adora Mba, the founder of the Afropolitan Collector, an art advisory platform.

""I'm really looking forward to seeing how big it can go.""

Of all Africa's major art events, few rouse as much enthusiasm and respect as Senegal's Dakar Biennale, commonly known as Dak'Art.

""It always brings together the best of the African art community to show brilliant work, engage in important dialogues and, of course, celebrate,"" said Gallery 1957's Zakhem.

""It always outdoes itself,"" agreed Mba, for whom Dak'Art is the ultimate place to discover new talent and up-and-comers. ""I don't even know how they keep producing such amazing art and artists and bringing people in.""

Supported by the country's Ministry of Culture and Communication, the 14th edition will centre on the theme of I'Ndaffa/Forger/Out of Fire - a trilingual take on the word ""forge"" in Serer, French and English.

""This general theme refers to the founding act of African creation, which nourishes the diversity of contemporary African creativity, while projecting new ways of telling and understanding Africa,"" Artistic Director El Hadji Malick Ndiaye, a curator at Dakar's Theodore Monod Museum of African Art, said in a statement.

""It represents the dynamics and action of creating, recreating and kneading. It thus refers to the forge that transforms, the deposit from which the raw material comes, and to the fire that creates.""

This year's event will be held from May 28 to June 28.

Africa may not lead the world in terms of the number of major art events held annually, but there is no shortage of arts professionals looking to add to the tally.

To that end, the Stellenbosch Triennale, conceived by the Stellenbosch Outdoor Sculpture Trust, will make its debut in South Africa in February.

Breaking with convention, the event is more about engaging the community than appealing to art world insiders.

On their website, organisers say they plan to turn the city into a ""curated public laboratory for creative expressions and engagements"" where all are invited to interrogate our relationship with nature, the limits of technology and the definition of citizenship.

Works will be displayed at sites across the historic city, and there will also be opportunities to continue the conversation in workshops and online.",Africa makes a scene: Best contemporary art fairs of 2020,"arts, culture, entertainment and media",culture,1111

ST. PETERSBURG, August 22. /TASS/. Russian specialists and experts are willing
to take part in restoring the museum of the ancient city of Palmyra. However,
monument restoration is not in talks right now, the issue will be decided by
the international community after the hostilities in Syria end, Director of
the Russian Hermitage Museum Mikhail Piotrovsky told reporters on Thursday.

“We are willing to participate in the restoration of the Palmyra museum, as
well as reopening the Damascus museum. To these ends, the works on 3D geodesic
footage and technical drawings will continue. We will exhibit it in the
Hermitage, it will become a basis for the Syrian restoration artists’
internships,” he said following the talks with Head of the Syrian Directorate-
General for Antiquities and Museums (DGAM) Mahmoud Hammoud that were held on
August 20.

According to Piotrovsky, the cooperation agreement with the Syrian side is
planned to be signed in November.

Piotrovsky’s assessment suggests that it will take 1-2 years to restore the
Palmyra museum since the beginning of reconstruction works. He pointed out
that many exhibits were successfully salvaged and preserved, however, they
require restoration as well. The museum displays will be enlarged by the
monuments’ digital models created by Russian specialists.

“We need to reconstruct the building, update the displays and breathe new life
into it [the museum]. It will be a museum that is simultaneously traditional
and modern. The Hermitage Museum will take part in creation and structuring of
it, we will gather colleagues and partners. We will rebuild the museum and
cultural life will immediately begin there, touristic life, it will mean new
jobs,” the director of the Russian Hermitage Museum said.

## World Heritage Site

The ancient Syrian city of Palmyra, often referred to as the Bride of the
Syrian Desert, was an important hub along ancient trade routes, particularly
the Great Silk Road, in Western Asia. Its heyday encompassed the 1st-3rd
centuries AD, when a number of architectural monuments were built in the city,
which have been preserved in the desert up to this day.

UNESCO placed Palmyra on its list of world cultural heritage sites. The
militants who controlled Palmyra from May 2015 through March 2016 and from
December 2016 through March 2017 destroyed a number of monuments there.

The devastation prompted Russian restoration artists form the Hermitage Museum
and other agencies to join the work to collect materials and data on the
condition of the World Heritage Site.

In September 2016, after Syrian government forces had liberated the city, a
Russian expert team, headed by the Institute’s Deputy Director Natalya
Solovyova, went to Palmyra in September 2016 in order to record the scale of
the destruction, take photos and create a 3D model of the complex. The 3D
model of Palmyra was created based on photos taken by archeologists from the
Institute for the History of Material Culture at the Russian Academy of
Sciences and the State Hermitage Museum.

It took Russian experts about a year to create the model, which currently
presents the most complete and up-to-date information about the city’s
condition.

This year, Russian archeologists are planning to record more footage of the
treasured monuments in Palmyra to update the 3D model.

478734,russiainsider,"When feminism intrudes, the child becomes an idol, the woman becomes his priestess, and the man becomes an economic appendage. As a result, the entire family structure is destroyed.

Archpriest Sergei Rybakov, associate professor of theology department at Ryazan State University, chairman of the religious education department of the Ryazan diocese, answers the question: “Why does the modern family break up?”

""A lot depends on how the the hierarchy is setup. Previously, families had a patriarchal structure, in which a wife traditionally came to her husband each morning to request a blessing for the day. She also brought the children, who would receive blessings from their father. He would bless each of them with his right hand. This is the patriarchal way of the Orthodox family.”

“But then, due to spiritual impoverishment and the influence of liberal ideas, the man ceased to be recognized as a patriarch. As a result, a modern woman rarely fulfills what the apostle has commanded — not to teach, but to learn from her husband at home (1 Timothy 2:12; 1 Corinthians 14:35). There is no one to learn from now, and worldly wisdom is not enough. The soul of the woman remains hungry, and thus a kind of madness begins. She desires to seize power in the family. The child is often used as an excuse.""

""And thus there is a restructuring of the entire family. The child becomes the head of the family, who is served by the mother. The child becomes an idol, the woman becomes his priestess, and the man becomes an economic appendage. As a result, the entire family structure is destroyed, and the man leaves the family to find a place where he feels more comfortable. Thus the family falls apart.”

“This is confirmed by statistics: Where patriarchy is preserved, there are fewer divorces. The patriarchal family is more stable, and is immune to all sorts of difficulties. If there are fewer divorces, it means that a greater number of families acquire an understanding of the correct dispensation of the family, although it may be done with great difficulty.""

""Meanwhile, where there is a matriarchal approach to raising children, feminism breeds feminist women who are not ready to become wives and mothers, and feminist men who are not ready to become responsible husbands and fathers. So until the pedagogical attitude is changed — through intentional education about the Orthodox family — the situation will continue to be senseless.”

596368,thedailyblog,"The unions and the broader labour movement need to set the goal of closing the gap between the minimum wage and the living wage.

The living wage is calculated in a particular way but has remained about two-thirds of the average wage.

The new living wage number of $21.15 is 66.8% of the average ordinary time wage for the December quarter 2018 of $31.63.

This is useful for us as the CTU goal for the minimum wage is the same ie two-thirds of the average wage. That goal was also the official promise of the Labour Party in the past.

As the minimum wage gets closer to the living wage the goal of cementing in a  living wage rate (or preferably the two-thirds of the average wage goal) to be written into our collective employment agreements becomes more realistic.

The minimum wage is now $17.70 an hour. It is scheduled to increase to $18.90 next April 1, and then to $20 on April 1, 2021.

The current minimum wage is 56% of the average wage.

By the time it reaches $20 an hour in April 2021 it should be 60% of the average if the average wage moves at the same rate over the next two years as it did over the last.

I estimate the gap between the minimum wage and the two-thirds rate at that time will be about $2.15 an hour. Closing that gap as much as possible should be our goal.

In the last collective agreement negotiations in the fast food industry, we got employers to agree to increase their start rates by 10 cents an hour above the minimum wage and for the margins to be maintained for all rates above.

This means that the start rate at McDonald’s, Burger King and Wendy’s is now  $18 an hour or 30 cents an hour above the minimum wage. This is very modest but it is a huge advance in this industry which has successfully resisted ever paying more for their start rates than the minimum in the past. As a union, we also focussed first on getting rid of youth rates and ending zero hours before focussing on getting above the minimum in the last round of negotiations.

Keeping on closing that gap has to remain the goal.

The government has also committed to paying contractors the living wage. If that happens it will be a nightmare for employers like Armourguard who keep nearly all staff on the minimum wage but have contracts at WINZ for example. Having some staff on the minimum and some on the living wage will be untenable in the longer term.

Some major employers like Bunnings have committed to the living wage already.

We need to get the parties that are part of the governing coalition to commit to continuing to increase the minimum wage to two-thirds of the average wage.

An increase of a $1 an hour each year for three years would probably achieve that goal. This is a modest increase after the last three years but will still achieve our goal.

427334,prepareforchange,"There are a lot of reasons people question vaccines in a country with the most aggressive vaccine schedule in the world where citizens are not allowed to directly sue vaccine manufacturers for vaccine-induced injuries.

While the censorship rages against the so-called “anti-vax” community to shut down online content that even questions the safety and effectiveness of vaccines on various platforms including YouTube, Facebook, and even Amazon, it’s quietly coming out all over the place that our vaccines just really aren’t as effective as the CDC, Big Pharma, it’s lackeys (again, this), and the pro-vaccine crowd would have everyone believe.

Straight away, here are three reasons that have popped up in recent weeks why people are questioning the effectiveness of vaccines.

The Business Insider reported March 29, 2019 that 27 US Navy sailors have been quarantined at sea for several months now due to a viral outbreak of what they are craftily referring to as a “probable case of the mumps”:

A US Navy warship deployed to the Persian Gulf has been stuck at sea for months due to a viral outbreak of what’s likely the mumps, and servicemembers are continuing to fall ill as the medical workers try to get the situation under control, Fifth Fleet told Business Insider Thursday.

If you were not aware, all branches of the US military require a full battery of vaccines for all new recruits.

According to this chart on military vaccines administered for Basic Training and Officer Accession Training, updated Feb. 2019, “Measles Mumps and rubella (MMR) are administered to all recruits regardless of prior history”.

Meaning, that even if these servicemembers received their required MMR vaccines as children, they would have been given yet another upon entering the Navy.

So… Why are they getting mumps?

Well, that depends who you ask. The Business Insider promptly changed its headline to add the word “rare”.

Meanwhile, what most people don’t know is that two former Merck virologists blew the whistle on the MMR vaccine’s effectiveness nearly a decade ago by filing a qui tam action lawsuit against Merck & Co. in August 2010.

As you can see from the suit, the former Merck scientists claim that “by using improper testing techniques and falsifying test data,” Merck is concealing the fact that the company knows specifically that its mumps vaccine is “far less than” the 95 percent effectiveness the company claims:

The introduction to the 2010 whistleblower lawsuit against Merck & Co.

Note that the suit is specifically about the efficacy of the mumps vaccine, including MMR II and ProQuad versions.

Not only that, but the former Merck virologists also claim this is a “decade-long scheme to falsify and misrepresent the true efficacy of its vaccine”. So this has allegedly been going on since at least 2000, and the lawsuit has been prodding along ever so slowly since 2010.

It’s 2019 now. I wonder how long they’re gonna drag this thing out, don’t you?

On an MMR aside, it was also reported in the March 2017 edition of the Journal of Clinical Microbiology (Vol. 55, Issue 3) that, “During the measles outbreak in California in 2015, a large number of suspected cases occurred in recent vaccinees” and “Of the 194 measles virus sequences obtained in the United States in 2015” a whopping “73 were identified as vaccine sequences”.

So there’s that. New technology is allowing researchers to sequence viruses and find out if they are wild — or from a vaccine.

CDC Announces in March 2019 that Children Are “Less Protected” by Whooping Cough Vaccines than They Once Were

On March 14 it was reported that CDC researchers analyzed lab samples from whooping cough patients between 2000 and 2013 and determined that the bacteria that causes whooping cough has undergone genetic changes over time.

In short, the vaccination they are currently administering to children for pertussis, including in the DTaP vaccine, is no longer effective because the whooping cough bacteria has mutated. How long has that been the case? Hard to say.

And yet, the USA Today article still went on to claim, “The best protection against whooping cough remains the DTaP vaccine”.

Really? How does that work? (Oh, right…)

“We’re making the best use of the vaccine, while we’re frantically doing research to make a better one,” Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told NBC News. Not sure how they can “make the best use” out of a vaccine that they basically just admitted is pretty well worthless.

Dr. Schaffner also noted that a new vaccine for whooping cough “is nowhere near ready”.

CDC Says This Year’s Flu Vaccine Has an Overall Effectiveness of Just 47%

But take a look at this breakdown, as per Table 2 of the CDC’s Feb. 15, 2019 MMWR (click to enlarge):

While the overall adjusted effectiveness for all age groups comes out to 47 percent, the older one gets, the less effective the flu vaccine becomes. That 47 percent actually breaks out as 61 percent overall for ages six months to 17 years; 37 percent overall for 18-49 years; and just 24 percent overall for people age 50 and over.

CNN once again spoke to Dr. William Schaffner (guess he’s the go-to soundbite guy on vaccines for our nation’s mainstream media outlets this year?) who said, “those who get flu after receiving vaccine” (Wait, isn’t that supposed to be the point? Taking a vaccine to prevent the flu? Oh sorry, continuing — ) “are less likely to require hospitalization and are less likely to die of the illness”.

He followed that with, “The vaccine is not perfect, but give the vaccine credit for softening the blow.”

Is that the best spin they’ve got? How many other times in life is a 47 percent hailed as a success? That’s less than half a chance that the shot is worthless.

Then again, maybe they are comparing the 2019 flu vaccine to last year, when it was reported that the 2018 vaccine would only be 10 percent effective.

At the announcement, doctors were still telling people that 10 percent is quote “better than nothing” and Dr. Pardis Sabeti, a Harvard professor and infectious disease expert, doubled down on CBS This Morning with, “In fact, in a year where it’s low effectiveness, it’s even more important that everybody get it so we can get as much resistance and we don’t allow the virus to thrive and grow and keep changing.” [emphasis added]

That logic is just… painful to behold.

Maybe now is a good time to point out that major pharmaceutical companies spend billions of dollars every year peddling their wares.

By billions, we’re talking nearly $30 billion in 2016 alone. Big Pharma forked over $9.6 billion to mainstream media outlets for the privilege of running direct-to-consumer (DTC) ads that year. That means American viewers saw an astounding 663,000 TV commercials for pharmaceuticals in 2016.

You can barely make your way through a show on most major networks these days without at least one generic stock footage filled commercial where a friendly voiceover actor — after listing off a vague set of symptoms followed by a bunch of nightmarish side effects — implores us to become our own drug sales rep and ‘ ask our doctor today’ for whatever drug will supposedly make our lives as great as the people smiling their way through the generic stock footage.

The US is one of only two countries in the entire world where pharmaceutical companies are legally allowed to sell drugs directly to consumers (the other is Australia). Nowhere else on the planet is DTC pharmaceutical advertising allowed.

Our government representatives, well funded by Big Pharma campaign contributions and surrounded by the industry’s lobbyists ($27.5 million in 2018), are well aware of the fact that this practice is a cost effective way of turning viewers into patients. A 2008 House Commerce Committee report states,

“Every $1 spent on direct-to-consumer advertising results in up to a $6 increase in sales. One study demonstrated that every $1,000 spent on direct-to-consumer advertisements resulted in 24 new prescriptions.”

Recently, an FDA medical adviser straight up told Yahoo! Finance, “Congress is owned by pharma.”

The point, however, is with numbers that substantial, there is no possible way for mainstream outlets to pretend with a straight face that they do not have a vested interest in how their reporters treat topics like, oh, I dunno, vaccines.

“If nearly $10 billion was spent on advertising, where did the other $20 billion go?” you might ask. Well, dear reader, it went to persuading doctors and other medical professionals (who may or may not get interviewed by media outlets for their “professional” opinion) of “the benefits of prescription drugs”.

The establishment figures that sell vaccines and the corporations that produce them act like vaccines are completely risk-free, so even if there’s only a ghost of a chance a vaccine will actually be effective as promoted or promised, then it’s worth it.

The problem is, more and more people are realizing that vaccines are not 100 percent safe and without side effects. Those side effects are worth discussing, especially when we’re dealing with vaccines which the CDC has admitted are not as effective as they should be or Merck scientists-turned whistleblowers are litigating over.

The package inserts for vaccines list a wide and sometimes horrifying array of side effects. The MMR Insert, directly off Merck’s own website, says, “M-M-R II has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or potential to impair fertility.”

Ahem. Why not? Doesn’t that seem like an important thing to evaluate?

The government’s no-fault Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) has paid out $4 billion to vaccine injured Americans since it was set up in 1986. That’s the same year Congress signed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which in essence set up a system that does not allow Americans to directly sue vaccine manufacturers for vaccine injuries.

It’s probably not a coincidence that the schedule of vaccines went from seven injections and 24 doses in 1983 before this legislation was passed, to a whopping 51 injections of 70 doses by 2016.

Meanwhile, this is the kind of sentiment being posted on social media about so-called “anti-vaxxers”:

Sigh… Where do I even begin?

The UK High Commissioner to New Zealand and Samoa, Laura Clarke, confirmed that the Britons were among 31 people being treated in hospital following the incident.

White Island erupted with a large plume of ash and steam on Monday while dozens of people were exploring New Zealand's most active volcano.

The eruption killed at least five, while eight are still missing.

A total of 34 people were injured, but three have been discharged from hospital. Several of those who remain in hospital are in a critical condition.

Ms Clarke tweeted that her team were offering assistance to the family of two British women hospitalised by the eruption.

""We are supporting the family of two (GB) women who have been hospitalised in New Zealand,"" she tweeted.

""My team are deploying to offer assistance in person, & we remain in close contact with (NZ) authorities. We will do all we can to help any other Brits who need our help.""

Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday morning local time , Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that New Zealanders, as well as tourists from the UK, US, Australia, China and Malaysia, are among the ""missing and injured"".

She said: ""To those who have lost or are missing family and friends, we share in your unfathomable grief at this moment in time and in your sorrow.

""Your loved ones stood alongside Kiwis who are hosting you here and we grieve with you and we grieve with them."".

When asked if there was any chance any of the missing people survived, Superintendent Bruce Bird, the acting assistant commissioner for Districts, said: ""The pilot went out there and spent about 45 minutes and has provided a pretty good indication that we do not believe anyone else has survived the explosion.""

White Island erupted with a large plume of ash and steam on Monday while dozens of people were exploring New Zealand's most active volcano

Rescue teams were unable to access the island on foot due to unstable conditions hours after the eruption, which occurred shortly after 2pm local time on Monday.

The New Zealand Red Cross activated the missing list to allow people to self-register as safe and well, or to register details of a person they have lost contact with. Information on the list is submitted by members of public.

The list shows up to five people with a UK birthplace still unaccounted for.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted earlier: ""Devastating scenes in New Zealand. I've been in contact with Prime Minister @jacindaardern to express our deepest sympathies.

""There are many people still feared missing, and my heart goes out to all those affected and their families.""

White Island is in the Bay of Plenty , near the town of Tauranga on North Island.

The active volcano is a tourist hotspot but has erupted several times before, most recently in 2016 and during the 2012/13 period.

Parents, who no doubt purchased the phones for their kids, say they are concerned about children being distracted from their school work.

The Mail Online reports: Schools inspectors said they had also seen a marked increase in low-level disruption such as swinging on chairs during lessons, toe-tapping, passing notes and whispering.

As a result, Ofsted reports will now contain a behaviour category that schools must pass with flying colours to get an overall rating of ‘outstanding’.

At the moment, they are judged on the wide-ranging category ‘personal development, behaviour and welfare’.

The proposal is contained in a consultation document published today, with the changes due from September.

It states: ‘Creating a sufficiently disciplined environment is a prerequisite to any learning taking place. If behaviour is not managed effectively and learners are not instilled with positive attitudes to learning, nothing much will be learned.’

Sean Harford, Ofsted’s national director for education, said: ‘We want to really update the profile of behaviour. If every child behaved in school the standard would rocket up.’

Ofsted research shows that while serious and violent incidents have decreased, smaller distractions are on the rise.

Mr Harford added: ‘There aren’t the terrible examples as often as there were, if you go back 15 to 20 years, of behaviour. The problem now is more one about low-level disruption. That kind of thing is what has been on the rise and is the bane of teachers’ lives.’

He said teachers should instil attitudes that can be taken into the workplace, such as punctuality, being courteous and listening to each other.

Inspectors will gather evidence for their reports by interviewing staff and pupils to discover whether the school is being strict enough.

Luke Tryl, director of corporate strategy, said: ‘We had a series of polling and focus groups with parents.

‘They wanted to know would their child be learning in an environment without that low-level disruption and which is free from bullying.’

Many schools ban mobiles, an idea backed by Education Secretary Damian Hinds.

Teachers have complained that their jobs are made tougher by pupils constantly texting each other during class. Some female staff have even been sexually harassed by students who take ‘upskirt’ photos and then post them on social media.

But Nick Brook, deputy general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘Ofsted already judges schools on behaviour, so we know the overwhelming majority of schools are orderly places where children learn effectively.

‘What parents really want to know is whether their children are happy and safe in school and making good progress.

‘In nine out of ten schools, this is the case. In places where it’s not, support rather than sanction is what is needed.’",Education Watch Dog To Crack Down On Pupils Using Their Mobile Phones During Lessons,education,teaching and learning,478
451101,realclearpolitics,"Twenty years ago this summer, I was a founder of the first charter school in New York state: the Sisulu-Walker Charter School of Harlem.

Ten years ago, then-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg praised charter schools as key to education success. But this summer, Mayor Bill de Blasio declared that he “hates” charter schools. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama championed charter schools, but many current Democratic presidential candidates now disparage them. What has happened, and why?

After years of never-ending political attacks by the traditional education establishment, New York charter schools are winning academically but struggling politically. They are winning with the long under-served minority communities who best know them; African American and Hispanic Democrats nationwide support the creation of charter schools by a 51% to 35% margin, according to Education Next’s 2019 poll. However, white Democrats now appear to oppose charters by a 57% to 33% margin and, I believe, may badly misunderstand the facts. Still, the facts support charter schools. The hating should end, and the best public schools -- charter or traditional -- should be allowed to flourish.

Let’s all recall why charter schools were created in the first place.

My chief community partner in starting Sisulu-Walker was Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker, the near legendary civil rights leader who had been executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Martin Luther King Jr.’s right hand in Birmingham and elsewhere, and chairman of Al Sharpton’s National Action Network.

Walker had “come north” in 1966, and as a local minister, he had watched the traditional public schools in Harlem and other poorer communities fail year after year, decade after decade, for over 30 years. He viewed charter schools as a civil rights issue, and as the best chance to break the unending history of education failure in Harlem and elsewhere.

“As I worked on other justice issues (housing, employment), I was frustrated that I had no tools to better the school system that served the families in my congregation,” Walker wrote in the forward to the book “A Light Shines in Harlem.”

“I became convinced that quality education was the inevitable component of the struggle that I had given my life to. That’s what led me to dive into the charter school movement. I have no regrets whatsoever,” Walker added. “In my most reflective moments, I believe this is where Dr. King would be if he were still alive.”

The little neighborhood school we started – Sisulu-Walker on 115th Street -- now serves 213 children, grades K-5. It opened its doors on Sept. 8, 1999, and is both New York’s longest-running charter school and the only charter school to survive from that pioneering year.

Sisulu is governed by local civic and community leaders and is led by an outstanding principal, Michelle Haynes, who grew up near the school and began at Sisulu as an assistant teacher in the founding year 1999. Like all charter schools, Sisulu is tuition-free and open to all. Under New York’s charter school law, it receives about 30% less funding per child than a traditional public school. It has never had use of a public school building and has always had to pay rent out of its already reduced budget. About 96% of Sisulu’s kids are African American or Hispanic (many from Central Harlem, District 5); about 90 percent qualify for free lunch; about 21 percent receive Special Education; and about 6 percent are English Language Learners.

Despite always needing to do more with less, the parents and teachers at Sisulu have used the “tools to better the school system” that Dr. Walker sought, and have used them well.

On the latest state exams, over 75% of Sisulu students tested in the top two performance categories (i.e., proficient or highly proficient) in math, vs. approximately 47% for all New York state students, 46% for all New York City students and 31% for Harlem District 5. On English language arts, Sisulu kids scored about 65% in the top categories vs. 45% for all New York state, 47% for all New York City, and 25% for Harlem District 5. Just as importantly, the parents and teachers of Sisulu-Walker have had the freedom and respect that, in the past, only money could buy: the freedom to control your own future and to choose the school that your child attends.

Overall, there are now about 292 charter public schools in New York state, serving about 130,000 students, and they also outperform the traditional public schools. Charter schools had 59% math proficiency vs. the state’s 47%. They had 54% ELA proficiency vs the state’s 45%.

What causes this outperformance for charter schools?

It is not cherry-picking the “best” kids. The charter school movement was built on the idea that all children can learn, and charter schools are tuition-free and open to all by law, with a lottery used to choose students in case of a waiting list. When Stanford University did a rigorous study to compare students of equal ability and desire (some of whom won the charter school admissions lottery, and some who lost), they found that charter schools raised learning levels, often by months of learning time each year.

It is not because of an inherent opposition to unions. New York’s charter law was originally written so that large charter schools begin with a union as a matter of law, and teachers at small charters can adopt a union at will. Dr. Walker was a strong supporter of organized labor as an ally of the civil rights movement. My own past activities include work with and for many unionized schools, including successful efforts to turn around schools and save union jobs from state takeover or closure.

It is not because charter schools are “for profit” vs “nonprofit,” a perpetual red herring issue. All New York charter schools have always been nonprofit 501(c )3 charities by state law. The so-called for-profit schools were ones where the community leaders hired professional education managers to advise them, just as they hire professional lawyers (“for-profit” lawyers) or architects (“for-profit” architects). The ability to hire and fire experts empowered the local leaders, and often gave them the critical start-up support they needed. In any case, about 10 years ago, charter school opponents made it illegal in New York for new schools to hire professional education managers as a way to prevent leaders like Dr. Walker from opening schools like Sisulu ever again.

The real reason a charter school succeeds is because of the entrepreneurial energy and talents of the school community itself.

Think of the traditional public school bureaucracy of Harlem in 1999 as a giant, monopolistic machine that everyone is sentenced to use; that is delivering failing results day after day, year after year; that never gets better; and that never has any competition to get better.

Charter schools are like little islands of freedom launched around the giant machine. Each must be licensed by the state (i.e. chartered) to regulate quality, but otherwise they are free to create: to offer programs based on core knowledge, or dual language, or a longer day, or whatever best idea they can conceive. The results of each effort depend on the team running it. There is no magic bullet for success, and the “customers” (the teachers and parents) decide where to go. The good projects grow, and the bad ones are shut down. Eventually, even the staff of the state machine realizes that the local kids can do better than the system ever expected, and so raise the system’s quality and goals as well.

Here in New York, the parents in Harlem, the Bronx, and elsewhere have voted in support of charters in the most important way possible: by entrusting their children to the better performing local charter schools. There are about 50,000 names on waiting lists for admissions to New York City charter schools. The families in Harlem and elsewhere who support charter schools know these schools firsthand, while charter opponents from outside the community may be too influenced by political messaging, or campaign fundraising power, separate and apart from real-world knowledge.

How can anyone “hate” a high-performing, succeed-against-all-odds little school like Sisulu? In truth, the real opposition to charter schools is driven by the traditional education establishment’s desire to protect money and turf; that is, because “money follows the child.” Yet competition can often improve traditional public schools, and Sarah Cordes of Temple University has found that “students whose [district] schools are near charters do better, and the closer the charter is, the better these [district school] students do.” Further, a good fraction of money does not follow the child. If, for example, every child in New York City except one joined a charter school, there could be as much as $5 billion or more left in the traditional school budget with that last student.

In considering charter schools, you can look through the lens of the managers of a monopoly machine concerned with losing customers to the upstarts opening around them.

Or you can look through the lens of Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker and the pioneering parents, children and teachers who started Sisulu-Walker 20 years ago; from the perspective of good people trapped in a failing education system for decades and desperate for a chance to have the respect, voice and freedom to build a newer, better public school of their own.

“In the charter school movement,” Walker wrote, “I am continuing the work of Dr. King that has far-reaching meaning. Every American child is deserving of a quality education.”

On the 20th anniversary of New York charter schools, haters should stop hating. The best performing public schools – charter or traditional – should be allowed to flourish, for the good of children and the civil rights of all.","As NY Charters Turn 20, Let Good Schools Flourish",education,school,1602

Police are examining CCTV after criminal damage was caused to the building in Cromer Road, Balsall Heath, on Saturday morning. Detectives do not believe the incident is linked to other attacks on mosques in the city earlier this week.

An investigation involving counter-terrorism officers was launched after five mosques had their windows broken with a sledgehammer in the early hours of Thursday morning.

West Midlands police said a 34-year-old man arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated criminal damage after handing himself into a city police station on Friday has been detained under the Mental Health Act.

No one else is being sought in relation to the first five incidents and detectives do not believe the suspect was part of an organised group, although the investigation is ongoing.

A 38-year-old man from Yardley, who was arrested after being detained by members of the community on Friday afternoon, has been released without charge and will face no further action.

Assistant chief constable Matt Ward of West Midlands police said: “We continue to work in partnership with mosques and local communities around the West Midlands.

""I have said many times this could be a peacekeeping operation. It is not foreseen by the Minsk process at all. And even when it is discussed by the leaders, a fair question arises: Are we going to withdraw from the Minsk deal? That is, I did not say anything 'anti- Minsk.' On the contrary, the leaders have long been discussing the possibility of changes that provide for the possibility of a peacekeeping mission,"" Prystaiko said.

At the same time, the minister noted that if this option does not work, for example, if Russia blocks a UN Security Council decision and no peacekeepers are deployed, the diplomatic system will probably offer Plan C.

162186,eveningstandard,"Powerful world leaders who suited up and flocked to Davos to meet for the World Economic Forum were given a dressing-down by a 16-year-old pupil last week.

Greta Thunberg, an environmental activist from Sweden, declared “our house is on fire” during an impassioned and sobering speech about climate change.

And she has caused quite a stir around the world with her scathing attacks on the very people she was addressing.

But who is this determined teenager, and why should we be listening to her?

Greta Thunberg first made headlines in August 2018 when she started a school strike to picket outside the Swedish parliament (Rikstag) to raise awareness of global warming.

In fact, Greta missed about three weeks of school, and did not return until after the Swedish general election on September 9. Her demands were simple – that politicians reduced carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement.

Since her first strike, she has become famous for her activism, and has even been invited to give her own TED talk.

In December 2018, the schoolgirl addressed the COP24 United Nations climate change summit and offered scathing words to the leaders she was addressing – accusing them of leaving the burden of climate change with future generations.

Although well-travelled, Greta refuses to fly, and travelled for 32 hours by train to get to Davos where she made her now viral speech to world leaders.

During her Davos speech, Greta said: “Yes, we are failing, but there is still time to turn everything around. We can still fix this.

""We still have everything in our own hands. But unless we recognise the overall failures of our current systems, we most probably don’t stand a chance.”

Greta has always been open about her Asperger’s syndrome, which she believes helps her commit to her cause and see things more simply.

Speaking to The New Yorker, Greta said:  “I see the world a bit different, from another perspective.

“I have a special interest. It’s very common that people on the autism spectrum have a special interest.”

Her outlook on climate change became clear in her speech at Davos, when she said: “You say nothing in life is black or white. But that is a lie. A very dangerous lie. Either we prevent 1.5C of warming or we don’t.”

Speaking to the BBC during her first school strike in September, Greta said she hoped her efforts would attract media attention.

The activist added she wanted people to “open their eyes, see the crisis and treat it like a crisis, and do something about it.”

When Greta first went on strike outside the Swedish parliament, she was moved on by police because protests on the premises are not allowed.

She later found another spot nearby to continue her protest but received further complaints.

Speaking to the BBC, she said she would probably be called to a hearing about her protesting, but added “I’m not bothered about it.”

During her speech to world leaders at the UN summit in December, she also accused them of “behaving like children.”

Words spoken by the climate activist herself at the UN summit in December prove that every little change one person makes will help protect our environment.

Since her strike action gained global attention, Greta has inspired students around the world to follow suit, in the School Strike 4 Climate Action.

In November, thousands of students halfway around the world in Australia took the day off school to attend protests calling on the government to take action on climate change.",Greta Thunberg: 5 things we can learn about climate change from a 16-year-old schoolgirl,environment,climate change,567

 The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA said on December 19 it had ""made a decision not to agree"" with the punishments imposed last week by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).

 

 A letter to WADA will be prepared on behalf of the president ""in the next 10-15 days,” it said, a move that will trigger the appeal process in the Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport.

 

 The WADA executive committee on December 9 made the unanimous decision to ban Russia’s athletes and officials from the Olympics, world championships, and other major events for four years.

 

 The move came after WADA concluded that Moscow had manipulated laboratory data handed over to its investigators in January.

 

 RUSADA had to hand over the data as a condition of its 2018 reinstatement following a three-year suspension after a large-scale over state-sponsored doping.

 

 Speaking in Moscow on December 19 at his annual news conference, Russian President Vladimir Putin said WADA had acted unfairly.

 

 “The overwhelming majority of our athletes are clean and then why must all of them suffer?” he asked.

 

 The bans mean Russia's flag and anthem will not be allowed at events such as the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and soccer’s 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

 

 Russian athletes who can prove they are untainted by the doping scandal will be able to compete as neutrals under the Olympic flag.

The Babae Ako movement (  I’m a Woman movement; stylized as #BabaeAko) is a women’s rights movement in the Philippines.

The social media campaign eventually took the form of live protests later held under the movement. The founders of the movement were included among the “25 Most Influential People on the Internet in 2018” list by Time Magazine.

227555,globalresearch,"At Davos, Switzerland every year the global capitalist elite gather to party…and to prepare for the year ahead. This year more than 1500 private jets will reportedly fly in. Thousands more of their underling staff will travel via business class to handle their personal, and corporate, logistics. Shielded from the media and the pubic, the big capitalists share views in back rooms and listen to experts on finance, government policy, technology, and the economy. The experts are especially probed to identify and explain the next ‘black swan’ or ‘gray rhino’ event about to erupt. Wealthy celebrities are invited to entertain them as well after evening dinner and cocktails. But the real networking goes on privately afterwards, in small groups or one on one, among the big capitalists themselves or in private meetings with heads of state, finance ministers, and central bank chairmen.

Typically each annual meeting has a theme. This year there are several: the slowing global economy, the fracturing of the international trade system, the growing levels of unsustainable debt everywhere, volatile financial asset markets with asset bubbles beginning to deflate, rising political instability and autocratic drift in both the advanced and emerging economies, accelerating income inequality worldwide—to mention just a short list.

On the eve of this year’s World Economic Forum gathering, some of the most powerful, wealthy, and more prescient capitalists have begun to speak out to their capitalist cousins, raising red flags about what they believe is an approaching crisis.

Ray Dalio, the billionaire who found and manages the world’s biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, warned that he and other investors had squeezed financial markets to such “levels where it is difficult to see where you can squeeze” further.  He publicly admitted in a Bloomberg News interview that, in the future profits will be low “for a very very long time”. The era of central banks providing free money, low rates, and excess liquidity have run their course, according to Dalio. He added the global economy is mired in dangerously high levels of debt, comparing it to the 1930s.

Paul Tudor Jones, another big finance capitalist, similarly warned of unsustainable debt levels—created by companies binging on cheap credit since 2009—that “could be systemically threatening”. Not just government debt. But especially corporate debt, where levels in the US alone have doubled to more than $9 trillion since 2009 (most of it high risk ‘junk bond’ and nearly as risky ‘BBB’ investment grade corporate bond debt).

Almost as worrisome, one might add, is the now more than $1 trillion leverage loan market debt in the US (i.e. loan equivalent of junk bonds). US household debt is also now approaching $15 trillion. And US national government debt, at $21 trillion, is about to surge over the next decade to $33 trillion due to the Trump 2018 tax cuts. And that’s not counting trillions more in US state and local government debt; or the tens of trillions of new dollarized debt undertaken by emerging market economies since 2010; or the $5 trillion in non-performing bank loans in Europe and Japan; or the even more private sector debt escalation in China.

Corporate debt levels are not alone the problem, however. Debt can rise so long as  financial asset prices and real profits do so—i.e. provide the cash flow available to service the debt. But when profits and asset prices (of stocks, bonds, derivatives, currency exchange rates, commodity futures, etc.) no longer rise, or start to turn down, then debt service (principal & interest) cannot be repaid. Defaults often follow, causing & investor confidence to slide. Real investment, employment, and household incomes thereafter collapse, and the real economy is dragged down in turn. The real decline further exacerbates the collapse of financial asset prices, and precipitates a mutual feedback of financial and real economic collapse.

And financial markets began to deflate in 2018; and it is now becoming increasingly clear that the real side of the global economy is slowing rapidly as well.

In February 2018 the first early warning appeared for financial markets. Stocks plunged in the US, Europe and even China. They temporarily recovered—a ‘dead cat bounce’ as they say before an even deeper decline in the fall. Then oil and commodity futures prices collapsed by 40% or more in late summer-early fall 2018. Stock markets followed again in October-December 2018 by 30-40% in US, China, Europe, and key emerging markets. Key merging market currencies—Argentina, Turkey, Indonesia, Brazil, South Africa—all fell precipitously as well. And housing prices from the UK to Australia to China to New York began to implode as the year ended.  In January 2019 stock markets recovered—i.e. a classic, short term, bull market recovery in what is today’s fundamentally long term global bear market.

Dalio’s and Jones’ worries by unsustainable debt and pending crisis have started to become real, in other words.

Becoming real as well is evidence of emerging defaults, a critical phase that typically follows asset markets’ decline and slowing profits. In the US there’s the Sears default, with JCPenney in the wings. And the giant corporation, once the largest in the world, the General Electric Corp., slouching toward default. Its global profits slowing and stock price imploding, GE is now desperately selling off its best assets to raise cash to pay its excess debt. It’s not alone. Scores of energy companies involved in US shale oil and gas production are teetering on the brink.  In Europe, there’s deepening troubles at Deutschebank, and just about all the Italian banks, and UBS in Switzerland, and the Greek banks.  In Japan, there’s trillions of dollars in non-performing bank loans as well, which Japan’s central bank continues to cover up. And then there’s China, with more than $5 trillion in bad loans held by local governments, by shadow bankers, and by its state owned enterprises that the China central bank and government keep bailing out by issuing ‘trusted loans’ (i.e. equivalent of junk bonds in US).

Default cracks have begun to appear everywhere in the global economy, in other words, major indicators that the excess debt accumulation and financial bubbles of the past decade cannot be ‘serviced’ (principal-interest paid) and have begun to negatively impact the global economy.

What’s becoming clear is that the next crisis will not emerge from the housing sector with excess debt and price bubbles driven by subprime mortgage loans and related financial derivatives.  What’s more likely is that the next crisis will emerge from debt defaults and collapsing real investment by non-financial corporations.  Moreover, the tipping point is nearer than most in business or media will admit.

Trump’s 2018 tax cuts simply threw a veil over the real condition of corporate performance in the US this past year. The tax cuts provided a windfall, one time subsidy to corporations’ bottom line. It is estimated that US S&P 500 corporations’ profits were boosted 22% by the Trump windfall tax cuts alone. Since S&P 500 profits for 2018 were roughly 27%, it means actual profits were barely 5%.  That’s the real situation going into 2019—a condition that assures US stock markets, junk bond markets, and leveraged loan markets in particular will experience even greater contraction in 2019 than they did in 2018. The bubbles will continue to pop.

In the global economy, it is even more evident that by the end of 2019 it is likely there will be  recession in wide sectors of the real global economy amidst further asset markets’ price declines.

In Europe, the growth engine of Germany is showing sure signs of slowing. Manufacturing and industrial production in the closing months of 2018 fell by 1.9%. After a GDP decline in the third quarter 2018, another fourth quarter 2018 German contraction will mean a technical recession. Equal to at least a third of all the Eurozone economy, as goes Germany goes Europe. France and Italy manufacturing are also contracting. Nearly having stagnated at 0.2% in the third quarter, the Europe economy in general may have slipped into recession already. And all that before the negative effects of a UK Brexit or an Italian banks’ implosion or deepening protests in France are further felt.

In emerging market economies, the steady rise of the US dollar in 2018 (driven by rising US central bank interest rates) devastated emerging market economies across the board. Rising dollar values translated into corresponding emerging market currency collapse. That triggered capital flight out of these economies, and their falling stock and bond markets in turn. To stem the outflow, their central banks raised interest rates, which precipitated deep recession in the real economy, while their collapsing currencies generated higher import prices and general inflation in their economies as well. That was the story from Argentina to Brazil to Turkey to South Africa and even to Asia in places.

The US halting of interest rate hikes in 2019 may relieve pressure on emerging market economies somewhat in 2019. But that easing will be more than offset by China’s 2019 economic slowdown now underway. In the second half of 2018 investment, consumer spending, and manufacturing all slowed markedly in China.  Officially at 6.6% for 2018, according to China statistics, China’s real economy is no doubt growing less than 6% due to the methods used to estimate growth in China. Its manufacturing began to contract in late 2018, and with it a significant slowdown in private investment and even consumer spending on autos and other durable goods.  China’s slowing will mean less demand for emerging market economies’ products and commodities, including oil and industrial metals. A respite for emerging market economies from the US dollar rising will thus be offset by China slowing.

When both financial asset markets and the real economy are together slowing it is a particularly strong ‘red flag’ warning for the economic road ahead.  And more contractions in stocks and other financial assets, together with slowing of manufacturing, housing, and GDP in Europe, US, and Japan in 2019, are likely which means trouble ahead in 2019.

Along with all the data increasingly pointing to financial asset deflation gaining a longer term foothold—and with real economy indicators like manufacturing, housing, GDP, exports as well now flashing red—there is also a growing list of political hotspots and potential ‘tail risks’ emerging in the global economy. Some of the ‘black swans’ are identifiable; some yet to be.

In the US, the government shutdown and the prospect of policy deadlock between the parties for two more years could qualify as a source of further economic disruption. In Europe, there are several ‘tail risks’: the Brexit situation coming to a head in April, the challenge to the Eurozone by the new Italian populist government, the chronic and deep street protests continuing in France, and the general rightward social and political drift throughout eastern Europe. In Latin America there’s the extremely repressive policies of Bolsonaro in Brazil and Macri in Argentina, which could end in mass public uprisings at some point.  In Asia, there’s corruption and scandals in Malaysia and India. And then there’s the US-trade war with China, which some factions in the US are trying to leverage to launch a new Cold War. Not least, there’s the potential collapse of negotiations between the US and North Korea that could lead to renewed threats of military conflict.  All these ‘political instabilities’ , given their number and scope, if left unresolved, or allowed to worsen, will have a further negative effect on business and consumer confidence—now already slowing rapidly—and in turn investment and therefore economic growth.

Ray Dalio’s and Tudor Jones’ warnings on the eve of Davos have been echoed by a growing list of capitalist notables and their government servants and echoes. IMF chairperson, Christine Lagarde, has been repeatedly declaring publicly that global trade and the economy are slowing.  Reflecting Europe in particular, where exports are even more critical to the economy, she has especially been warning about a potential severe US-China trade war disrupting the global trading system—and global economy in turn. The IMF has been issuing repeated downward adjustments of its global economic forecasts. So too has the World Bank. As have a growing number of big bank research departments, from Nomura Bank in Japan to UBS bank in Europe. Former US central bank chairs, Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke, have also jumped in and have been raising red flags about the course of the US and global economies. Former Fed chair, Greenspan, has even declared the US is already on a recession path from which it can’t now extricate itself.

Given all the emerging corroborating data, the red flags and warnings about the current state of the global economy, and the growing global political uncertainties, the Dalios, the Jones, and others among the Davos crowd are especially worried this year.

On the eve of the Forum’s first day on January 23, 2019, a leading discussion topic among the cocktail parties is the buzz about the just leaked private newsletter from billionaire Seth Klarman, who heads one of the world’s biggest funds, the Baupost Group.  In his newsletter leaked to the New York Times, and widely circulated among early Davos crowd attendees, Klarman reportedly chides his readers-investors about not paying more attention to the social and political instabilities growing worldwide, about Trump’s direction which is “quite dangerous”, and the US in effect retreating from global leadership, leaving a dangerous vacuum behind. Investors have also become too complacent about global debt and risk levels now rising dangerously, he argues. It could all very well lead to a financial panic, he adds. The US in particular is at an ‘inflection point’. He ominously concludes, “By the time such a crisis hits, it will likely be too late to get our house in order”.

The recent statements by Dalio, Tudor Jones, Klarman, and the others reminds one of the last crisis and crash of 2008. When Charlie Prince, CEO of Citigroup, the biggest bank at the time, was asked after the crisis why he didn’t see it coming and do something to avoid the toxic mortgage-derivatives bomb and protect his investors and customers, Prince replied he did see it coming but could do nothing to stop it. His investors and customers demanded his bank continue—like the other banks were—investing in subprime mortgages, lending to shadow banks, selling risky derivatives and thereby continuing to make money for them, just as the other banks were doing. Charlie’s response why he did nothing to stop it or prepare was, ‘when you come to the dance, you have to dance’.

No doubt the Davos crowd will be partying and dancing over the next several days in their securely gated, posh Switzerland retreat. After all, the last ten years has increased their capital incomes by literally tens of trillions of dollars. And capitalists are driven by a mindless herd mentality once they’ve made money. They believe they can continue doing so forever. They believe the money music will never stop. One can only wonder, if they’ll be dancing later this year to the same song as Charlie’s in 2008.

“He’s an enemy to sanity, he’s an enemy to stability,” Navarro said of Donald Trump.

“He’s an enemy to the American presidency. He’s an enemy of decency and of morality, and frankly, he’s an enemy of conservative and Republican principles, because if you are a Republican, you are a free trader. You are not for trade wars. You’re not for tariffs. You’re not for running a $1 trillion deficit. You’re not for antagonizing allies and coddling foes.” (RELATED: CNN’s Ana Navarro Does Her Nails During Immigration Debate Segment)

She continued, “When you see a president who is using the bully pulpit of the presidency to attack other Americans, to break international relations, to cause an instability and chaos, and I think what he’s trying to do is distract us from the fact that he inspired a white supremacist to go hunt down Latinos, and that he capitulated to the NRA and that, you know, his economy is going so badly!” (RELATED: Ana Navarro Loses It When Steve Cortes Says She’s On The Left)

Finally, she accused Trump of being “irresponsible, impulsive, ignorant, and short-sighted.”

760961,theindependent,"Men who use steroids to gain muscle could be damaging their chances of having children, according to scientists.

Researchers have revealed that men who use anabolic steroids, which mimic the effect of the male hormone testosterone in the body and are used as performance-enhancing drugs to increase muscle growth, have a 90 per cent chance of becoming sterile.

The academics state that so many people are inadvertently sacrificing their fertility that men are at risk of an evolutionary paradox.

Dubbed the Mossman-Pacey paradox, the theory is named after the two researchers who first described it: Dr James Mossman of Brown University and Professor Allan Pacey, from the University of Sheffield.

Speaking to the BBC, Dr Mossman said that taking steroids might make men look more “attractive” but could turn them into “an evolutionary dud”.

“I noticed some men coming in to have their fertility tested and these guys were huge,” said Dr Mossman.

“They are trying to look really big, to look like the pinnacles of evolution. But they are making themselves very unfit in an evolutionary sense, because without exception they had no sperm in their ejaculation at all.”

According to the NHS, the use of anabolic steroids has become one of the main causes of preventable male factor infertility.

Phil Harris, consultant gynaecologist and clinical lead at Fertility Fusion said: “I am seeing an increasing number of men at the clinic who simply aren’t aware of the damage that taking anabolic steroids can do to their long-term health and fertility.

""We advise anyone who wishes to start a family now and in the future to avoid taking anabolic steroids where possible”.

But, what effect does it really have?

The researchers state that steroids trick the brain’s pituitary gland into thinking the testes are going into overdrive.

As such, the glands react by shutting down the production of two hormones – called FSH and LH – which are the key hormones behind the production of sperm.

Mossman and Pacey add that there is a similar theme in men using medication to prevent male pattern baldness, and that while the damage to fertility from steroid use is well known, this is the first time scientists have coined a specific term due to the vast numbers of people now affected.

“I would say more anabolic steroid users are likely to become sterile than you would think - 90 per cent probably,” Pacey said.

""Baldness is a bit more hit-and-miss, but sales are going through the roof and that makes it an increasingly common problem.

“Isn’t it ironic that men go to the gym to look wonderful, for the most part to attract women, and inadvertently decrease their fertility.”

The NHS states that regularly taking anabolic steroids can lead to a number of physical and psychological changes in both men and women, as well as potentially dangerous medical conditions.

The physical effects in men can include reduced sperm count, shrunken testicles, breast development, increased risk of prostate cancer and severe acne.

While the physical effects in women include facial hair growth, loss of breasts, deepened voice and hair loss.

The findings follow a recent study which revealed that, like women, men may also have a time limit on having children.

According to a new study published in the journal Maturitas, men should consider banking their sperm before reaching “advanced paternal age”, which has been variably defined as above the age of 35 or 45 in medical fields.

This is because men older than this may experience decreased fertility, the study states, and put their female partners at higher risk of a number of pregnancy and birthing complications, such as gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia and preterm birth.

Additionally, infants born to older fathers may also be at higher risk of a number of conditions, such as congenital heart disease, newborn seizures and low birth weight.",Men who use steroids to build muscle have &apos;90% chance of becoming sterile&apos;,sport,bodybuilding,615

The top smartest children's names for boys and girls have been revealed and it's great news if your child is called George or Emma.

Online tutoring platform Tutor House used its data to compile a list of its most academically gifted students to find the names commonly associated with achieving high grades in school, college and university.

George, Tom and Mohammed complete the top three for the boys, and for girls Emma, Fatima and Eva were the highest performers, reports the Mirror.

In a bid to help parents choose a name that will give their bundle of joy a chance at academic success, here are the top 20 smartest names.

Tutor House, which offers private home tuition, analysed ten thousand names from the last five years and cross-referenced them with exam grades to find the brainy bunch.

Alex Dyer, founder of Tutor House, said: ""Parents often spend a great deal of time deliberating on what name to give their child, and rightly so.

""It forms part of your child’s identity, with social science studies finding that a name can influence careers, personality traits and even physicality.

""With that in mind, and considering the wealth of data we have, we thought it would be interesting to see what names are most commonly associated with being academically gifted.

58737,birminghammail,"Five more Birmingham schools have suspended teaching the award winning 'No Outsiders' equality and LGBT rights programme amid mounting pressure from parents and activists who want it scrapped.

The Leigh Trust, which runs five city primaries, has dropped the programme until after Ramadan in June while it consults with parents.

The trust schools involved are Leigh Primary School, Alston Primary School, Marlborough Junior, Marlborough Infants and Wyndcliff Primary School.

Meanwhile, an uneasy truce between protesting parents and Parkfield School in Saltley has come to an end, with fresh protests due tomorrow at the school gates.

The new wave of protests and suspension of No Outsiders at more schools marks a significant escalation amid concerns the campaign is being fuelled by homophobia and infiltrated by extremists looking to exploit the parents' concerns.

Today Mohammed Aikhlaq, one of the trust's directors and a Labour city councillor representing Ward End, confirmed the programme was being suspended for now.

""We sent letters to parents saying we will hold a board meeting to look at the issue after Ramadan and will be consulting with them about what is in the programme but it is on hold until then.""

""Nobody is against LGBT rights but there are concerns about telling four and five year olds about these issues,"" he said.

""It needs to be age appropriate and they are concerned about that.""

The programme has been run in the schools for three years. ""When it was introduced we fully consulted with parents. We feel it's right to do that again with a new group of parents.

""I do not feel we are being homophobic, it's a matter of sharing information with parents.""

Protests are due to start again tomorrow outside the Parkfield Community School, bringing an end to an uneasy truce designed to help parents and staff resolve the issue.

MPs Liam Byrne and Shabana Mahmood, aided by the region's schools commissioner, LGBT campaigners and Birmingham City Council, had brokered peace talks between parents and the school, which subsequently promised to temporarily halt lessons until resolution was reached.

Photos from a meeting over a curry between LGBT activists and protestors were posted on social media, triggering hopes that a solution was imminent.

However, it appears that truce is now over.

Parkfield parents, using the hashtags #Stop #NoOutsiders , posted on the Alum Rock Community Forum facebook page that a new protest would take place at the school gates tomorrow morning. (Thursday March 21st)

Parkfield campaigner Ahmid Ahmed had earlier told the BBC his community was ""respectful and tolerant"" of British values but now felt victimised.

He claimed parents who had protested were ""effectively seen as homophobes in the wider community"".

""Fundamentally the issue we have with No Outsiders is that it is changing our children's moral position on family values on sexuality and we are a traditional community.

""Morally we do not accept homosexuality as a valid sexual relationship to have. It's not about being homophobic... that's like saying, if you don't believe in Islam, you're Islamophobic.""

That drew a critical reaction from the city council's deputy leader Brigid Jones, who tweeted:

""Saying 'morally we don't accept homosexuality as a valid sexual relationship' is homophobia. Cheering on someone who stands outside a school with a megaphone shouting that children aren't safe with a gay teacher is homophobia. I do not understand how there is ambiguity about this.'

MP Mr Byrne, whose Hodge Hill constituency includes Parkfield, said talks were continuing to try to bring about a resolution.

He said parents at the school did not endorse homophobic views.

A new cross party education equalities group is also being set up in the city, and new talks are also taking place this week between Parkfield parents, LGBT+ representatives and Department for Education officials, he said.

Sara Khan, the national lead commissioner on Counter Extremism, was in Birmingham this week. In an exclusive interview with BirminghamLive she said: ""There is evidence people travelled from other parts of the country, including South Wales, to exploit the situation at Parkfield School.

""It is a tactic used by extremists - they get involved in an issue they have no stake in, handing out leaflets, posting videos and flyers online, to create a climate that is not helpful. We know that is what was happening here.""

Perry Barr MP Khalid Mahmood also broke his silence on the issue, saying he understands the concerns of Muslim parents about the age appropriateness of some aspects of No Outsiders.

""The issue here for many parents is whether the programme is teaching materials that are age appropriate for younger children. I have previously criticised people promoting the wearing of the hijab in primary schools as I feel that too is not age appropriate and is sexualising young people - if I say that, then I have to say the same here to maintain an even balance.""

Parkfield's assistant headteacher Andrew Moffat, who created and piloted No Outsiders, previously revealed how he felt targeted amid personal threats and insults, but vowed he was ""in exactly the right place"" and ""feedback from the vast majority of parents has been good"".

Ironically, he was today flying out to Dubai to hear if he has been named world teacher of the year. Moffatt is one of 10 teachers from around the world who have made it to the shortlist for the  Varkey Foundation Global Teacher Prize 2019. The award will be announced this weekend.

118582,conservativehome,"Benedict Rogers is East Asia Team Leader at the international human rights organisation CSW, co-founder and Deputy Chair of the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission, a former parliamentary candidate and a Senior Fellow at the Religious Freedom Institute.

As a former journalist, a human rights campaigner and a Christian, there are obvious reasons why I like Jeremy Hunt. As Foreign Secretary he has done more in a year than any of his predecessors combined to champion human rights – and in particular press freedom and freedom of religion or belief, two foundational freedoms that underpin any civilized democratic society.

Hunt has also done more to speak out against crimes against humanity in Burma, for the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and peace in Yemen than his predecessors. His decision not just to mandate the Bishop of Truro to conduct an inquiry into the persecution of Christians but to write, every day throughout Lent, to a persecuted Christian, speaks volumes about his values.

So too did his decision, on his first visit to Beijing, to meet the wives of jailed Chinese human rights lawyers. And his statements on Hong Kong, a city I lived in for the first five years of my working life and to which I was denied entry on the orders of Beijing 18 months ago, have been far more robust than his predecessors. Has he done enough? No, of course not: no activist would say enough had been done. But has he shone, as a Foreign Secretary who prioritises human rights? Definitely.

But of course, one doesn’t vote solely on these issues. The challenges facing our party and our country are wide-ranging. Brexit is the most immediate and most obvious. But there are pressures on our public services, threats to our security, challenges to our economy and questions about our standing in the world. And the answer to all of these major questions is clear: Hunt.

Of the original 11 candidates, there were only ever four whom I seriously considered – Sajid Javid, Michael Gove, Rory Stewart and Jeremy Hunt. Rarely have I had such a difficult choice. Rarely have I been such a floating voter.

I didn’t declare my support until last Thursday, when Javid was knocked out, for the simple reason that whichever one of my four favourites made it into the final two would have won my support. It was only when Javid was eliminated that I decided, when it came down to the final three, to declare my support for Hunt. Once I made the decision, the reasons crystalised. It comes down to three factors: character, values and dignity.

I have not really met Hunt. The only time we have encountered each other was just before Christmas last year. To my surprise, I received an invitation to a meeting with the Foreign Secretary to discuss the persecution of Christians – prior to his announcement of a review. Around the table were the Archbishop of Canterbury, a Catholic bishop representing Cardinal Nichols, the Coptic Archbishop Angaelos, the chief executives of three charities, and survivors of persecution.

I was impressed by Hunt’s personal engagement with the issue. It was obvious by the fact that he allowed people to speak for far longer than they should have done, and asked insightful questions, that he really cared.

While we had never met before, when he called me to speak he addressed me by my first name, and as he left he said: “It’s great to finally meet you.” There’s no reason, in the great scheme of things, why he should know who I am, but he did and that shows an impressive mastery of detail and personal focus.

I first became aware of Hunt about 13 years ago. A colleague of mine was his constituent. My colleague is a living saint – the epitome of charity, compassion, justice and Christian faith. But he is definitely not a Tory – he is firmly on the Left. Yet he told me early on that he had become a fan of his local MP – Hunt – who, he said, was remarkably responsive, compassionate and interested in human rights. My colleague then brought a Burmese friend, the daughter of a political prisoner, to see Hunt.

I am inspired by Hunt’s emphasis on turbo-charging the economy, deploying his experience as an entrepreneur to turn post-Brexit Britain into the world’s most dynamic economy. A man who has made millions from a successful business, and known the hard grind of business failure, is more likely to be able to take us forward as a global enterprise than one who has never run anything except some precarious newspaper columns.

One handicap sometimes held up is Hunt’s conflict with doctors. But if you look at his record as Health Secretary in full, it is this: he stood up to vested interests, expanded NHS delivery, won battles for further funding and championed the NHS – all qualities we want in a Prime Minister.

Brexit must be delivered, and made not just to work but to succeed. For that to happen all of us, whatever side we were on three years ago, must come together. That means we don’t need a ‘Brexiteer’ leader, we need a unifier, a leader who is not marked by labels but by their ability to implement the referendum result. We need a skilled and experienced negotiator. That man is Hunt.

If Britain is to walk tall in the world post-Brexit, it needs a leader respected by his counterparts as a statesman, taken seriously and not regarded as a subject of mirth. And we need a man who is internationalist and outward-looking. Hunt is clearly that man. Just read his speech on building an “invisible chain” of democracies.

My mother used to live in Japan, and speaks Japanese. When I showed her the video of Mr Hunt delivering a speech in fluent Japanese with no notes she was impressed. To have a Prime Minister who can speak several languages fluently walking the world stage would help turbo-charge Global Britain.

I joined the Conservative Party at the precocious age of 13. In 2005, I stood for Parliament. I have been a Conservative for over 30 years, and I retain hope. In times of victory and wilderness, I have never doubted the Conservative dream and Conservative values. In ups and downs, in government and opposition, I have stuck with three things I hold dear: a Great Britain, a Global Britain and a compassionate conservatism. It is clear to me that it is Hunt who will deliver all three.

I have always championed the underdog – minorities in Burma and Indonesia, prisoners in North Korea, dissidents in China and Hong Kong. So once again, I am with the underdog, and I believe he can win. As the American poet James Russell Lowell once wrote, “once to every man and nation, comes the moment to decide, in the strife of Truth with Falsehood, for the good or evil side … Then to side with truth is noble, when we share her wretched crust, Ere her cause bring fame and profit, and ‘tis prosperous to be just; Then it is the brave man chooses while the coward stands aside.”","Benedict Rogers: Character, values and dignity.

550297,sputnik,"A recent instance of Quran burning by Stop Islamisation of Norway (SIAN) in the city of Kristiansand, which some called Norway's first, has set off a passionate debate on the acceptance of such actions and the perceived collision between the freedom of speech and freedom of religion.

As the police ultimately intervened to stop SIAN's demonstration amid a brawl between activists and their opponents, they were acting on a new explicit order from Police Director Benedicte Bjørnland, Norwegian broadcaster NRK reported.

Bjørnland said that instances of setting fire to all religious symbols must be handled equally and correctly.

“The message is 'if you still do it, we will stop it'”, Bjørnland said, admitting that the assessment of whether to intervene in the freedom of expression and assembly is a difficult issue. “Everyone should speak up as long as they do not violate laws, in this case the Criminal Code. We are not an opinion police, but we have guidance, and when we see violations of the given guidelines, we intervene”.

An important reason for the new interpretation is a threat assessment from the Police Security Service (PST) that public Quran burnings could lead to serious revenge attacks against Norway.

“It is true that in recent months PST has been concerned about the consequences a Quran burning can have. We see it as a trigger event for violent actions, and have provided a description of the situation to the police”, PST senior adviser Martin Bernsen said, as quoted by NRK.

However, the police order is not solely aimed at anti-Islamic provocations, but deals with all kinds of religious symbols being desecrated.

​Following the demonstration in Kristiansand, one SIAN member was arrested for failing to comply with police orders.

Kristiansand Mayor Harald Furre, who was present during SIAN's demonstration, condemned the actions.

“I wish the police had intervened earlier and prevented the ignition”, Furre said.

Police chief in the Agder District Morten Sjustøl called such actions controversial, stressing that they stir up strong engagement.

SIAN leader Lars Thorsen called the action “a good way to visualise the negative power that Islam is” and made it clear that reprises of the action are not to be excluded.

Stop Islamisation of Norway dates back to the early 2000s and claims to counter the proliferation of Islam, which it views as a totalitarian political ideology that violates the Norwegian Constitution as well as democratic and human values.

Thorsen is no stranger to political controversy, having recently received a 30 day suspended jail sentence and a fine for distributing pamphlets in the Norwegian capital that called Muslims “notorious sexual predators” who “rape in epidemic proportions”.",Norwegian Police Ordered to Stop Quran Burnings out of 'Concern' Over Retaliation Attacks,religion and belief,religious text,426
509861,sottnet,"Father Christmas, also known as Santa Claus, Saint Nicholas or Kris Kringle, dates back almost 2,000 years, but it seems that it's time for a rethink of everything in 2019 as a modern agenda takes a subversive twist on tradition.Santa's modern design was created in the late 1800's by American artist Thomas Nast, in a collection of sketches for Harper's magazine.The ""Santa-free non-Christmas party"" was supported by some but mostly mocked online., but for decades now various activists have tried to make Santa more relevant - or have recruited him (or her, or them) to push their agenda.The fight for female Santas is going strong. Although women used to play Father Christmas during the Second World War, feminist ideology and the man in red didn't have a loud clash until 1995. Donna Underwood was thrust into the spotlight when she was hired to portray Santa for a local mall in West Virginia. People complained, she was fired, sued, and lost.Disney wants in, too; its latest Christmas comedy film 'Noelle' (which didn't make it to cinemas but was shown on Disney+) has Anna Kendrick stepping into Santa's shoes. Review website Rotten Tomatoes states ""The always-charming Anna Kendrick does her best, but Noelle's progressive take on a timeless tale is unfortunately subdued.""In the fight for racial equality Santa was conscripted by the civil rights movement in 1960s America. The 1970s onwards saw only a few retailers daring to hire more ethnically diverse Santas (including Macy's flagship store in New York). Most caused mass outrage and hit the headlines for the wrong reason.Having a black Father Christmas is still a contentious subject. In 2016 the Mall of America made history by hiring its first-ever Black Santa.

181129,eveningstandard,"Flash flooding has wiped out roads and destroyed a bridge in the Yorkshire Dales with more heavy rain to come, forecasters have warned.

Residents were today clearing up the devastation wreaked in their homes by flash flooding after a month's worth of rain fell in just hours yesterday.

Travel conditions across north Yorkshire were described by police as ""shocking"" after 50mm of rain fell in a short space of time. Roads were washed away, bridges made impassable, and homeowners have been left with their belongings destroyed.

Rescuers reported seeing sheds and oil tanks floating down roads as ""100 or more"" homes in the Yorkshire Dales were hit by the deluge.

A clean-up operation has started in the worst hit villages, with one local resident describing their community as a ""virtual lake"".

A bridge over Cogden Gill on Grinton Moor, which featured in the opening stage of the 2014 Tour de France, was reduced to ruins, leaving a gaping hole.

Swaledale Mountain Rescue Team, which posted a photo of the wrecked bridge, urged motorists to ""only travel if essential as many routes are impassable"".

A representative for the team, Steve Clough, said: ""The roads were a raging torrent and there were sheds and household oil tanks floating down them.""

His team spent more than eight hours searching properties in the area, rescuing about 10 people, but added that North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service helped many more.

He estimated ""100 or more"" homes had been affected, adding: ""Some homes had a metre of water in them - it was horrific.""

Troops have been sent in today to help with the clean-up operation.

The fire service said it received around 115 calls to flooding incidents in Leyburn and Reeth on Tuesday evening, with one resident describing the community's shock at what happened.

""We expected some rain, we expected some stormy weather, but I think collectively in the valley here no-one really expected what happened,"" event organiser Alex Rafferty said.

He and his team have had to cancel the Ard Rock mountain bike festival, which was meant to take place in Reeth from Thursday to Sunday, because it would be ""impossible"" to pitch tents in the flooded fields.

""It truly just came down off the hills in waterfalls, it blew the riverbanks and has damaged a huge amount of infrastructure, local houses and local businesses,"" he said.

Wilf Bishop, 77, who has lived in the Yorkshire Dales since 1988 and moved to Reeth in 2000 called the conditions ""appalling, absolutely appalling"".

Describing how the rain came down from the hillside, he said: ""We'd just got back from a walk on the hillside and it started to rain a little, then within minutes it was this astonishing downpour.

""You can see just walking around the village the effect that it has had. People's gardens are covered in silt and mud, their lawns don't exist any more.

""The farmers - the hay that they've just taken and bailed up has been strewn everywhere, so that will be written off.

""I guess livestock has been lost, I don't know. It's turned this part of Reeth, the lower part, into a virtual lake, and everyone is working hard to try and recover it.""

The drama continued in other parts of north Yorkshire, where a man and a woman were left clinging to a cliff ""by their fingernails"".

The pair were cut off by the tide on Tuesday afternoon as they walked along a beach, so they clambered 100ft up the Filey Brigg cliff to escape, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency reported.

Matt Atkinson, of HM Coastguard, said in a statement: ""When the Coastguard teams arrived on scene the man and woman were clinging on by their fingernails so we knew that we had to act fast.""

They were rescued by two coastguard teas after which they were described as “safe and well”.

Pictures and videos on social media showed further flooding across the Yorkshire Dales.

Malham Tarn saw 82.2mm of rain in 24 hours, the majority of which fell within four hours. The monthly average in the area for this time of year is 89mm.

Roads resembled rivers, with the main road linking Richmond and villages including Reeth washed away near Grinton.

The fierce flooding followed a violent hail and rain storm further west, which caused a landslide to block the main settle to Carlisle railway line between Kirkby Stephen and Garsdale.

Hailstones the size of sweets or “pickled onions” fell in some areas, causing damage and destruction.

Gareth Walls, of Ripon, posted a clip of the hailstones pounding down on his car on Tuesday afternoon.

He tweeted a picture of one of the hailstones, saying: ""The hail was like pickled onions.""

Farmer Andrew Loftus, from Masham, said some of the hailstones measured almost an inch in diameter.

He posted a picture of a toy digger on a blanket of white with the words: ""My son's digger has its work cut out with these hailstones!""

The Brymor Ice Cream parlour, near Masham, said the freak hailstorm left some customers with minor injuries.

The attraction posted on Facebook: ""Today was an extremely distressing day for both our visitors and staff. No one could have predicted the damage a freak storm caused.

""We did our best to cope with the extreme conditions that unfolded in a matter of minutes.

""Our parlour suffered damage to the roof, power failures and some visitors suffered minor injuries.""

Farmer Raymond Caldert said: ""I haven't seen anything like this.

""We had a storm here about 20 years ago, called Hurricane Charlie. I think this has been worse.""

While clean-up operations continue, the Met Office has warned that the extreme weather is not over.

Issuing a severe weather warning, the national forecaster said storms could dump up to 40mm of rain in two hours in parts of central and northern England on Wednesday.

The yellow weather warning suggests further thunderstorms and heavy downpours could spark further travel disruption across the region.

A similar alert for thunderstorms is in place in Scotland, with damage to buildings possible ""from floodwater, lightning strikes, hail or strong winds"".

There are 10 flood warnings in place across the UK - from North Yorkshire, Lancashire and the West Midlands - with the Environment Agency urging residents to be prepared.

Manchester Piccadilly train station has said services are still disrupted by debris left by a landslip caused by flooding on Tuesday near Beeston Castle.

""Work is expected to continue until at least 4pm,"" it tweeted.

646267,thedailyrecord,"The number of people left in desperate need of food aid has doubled in West Dunbartonshire due to the devastating impact of Universal Credit.

Foodbank charity Food For Thought claim they have been left struggling to cope with the demand to help those in financial crisis.

Staff at the organisation, based in St Augustine’s Episcopal Church in Dumbarton, are currently giving out 12 parcels of emergency food aid every day to those in need.

Prior to the full roll out of the controversial benefits system in West Dunbartonshire on November 28, volunteers say up to six food packages would be handed out.

The shocking increase in referrals has now left the charity fighting to keep their shelves stocked, costing them up to £200 per week.

And a spokesman from Food For Thought says those being plunged into poverty are directly linked to the new one payment system – which replaces six separate benefits.

He said: “We have had a spike since January and that is a result of Universal Credit (UC).

“Before Christmas we were giving out five or six parcels a day and now we’re averaging 12 food parcels per day.

“It doesn’t sound a lot but we are open five days a week and we also run a community kitchen two days a week so in terms of our supply it is difficult for us to keep it up.

“Universal Credit fully rolled out in West Dunbartonshire just before Christmas so we feel there is a direct link there. We predicted that this would happen.

“Ninety percent of the people who come through our doors have been sanctioned as a result of Universal Credit.”

Volunteers at Food For Thought previously said they were “preparing for an onslaught” of those in need after it was revealed new UC claimants would be left with no benefits for over a month throughout the festive period.

The organisation, which also runs a community kitchen at the church hall every Wednesday and Thursday, was able to cope with the demand due to donations handed in by the community over Christmas.

However, the donations are now all gone and volunteers are having to stock up by shopping in Dumbarton supermarkets in order to continue providing their vital service.

The spokesman added: “We were fortunate to receive a lot of donations at Christmas time but we are now into March and those donations are gone. We are now at a point where we are having to keep spending money in supermarkets just to keep up with the demand.

They are now appealing to residents in West Dunbartonshire to donate if they can.

“We don’t have anyone giving us money at the moment so we are sometimes surviving on donations of £10 or £20 from people who come in.

“Having to pay this money out is going to have an effect on the service which we provide, as we are talking about £150-£200 every week just to keep our shelves stocked.

“We are happy to take any donations from the community whether it be food or money which we can spend on our food supply as we do not receive any money from anywhere else so we do need the help and support.”

A DWP spokeswoman said: “Universal Credit is a force for good, helping people into work faster than the old system, and we’ve made significant improvements to make sure people can access money quicker.

“Less than three percent of people subject to requirements for their benefits are under sanction, and only when they haven’t met them without good reason.”

Anyone wishing to help can drop donations off at St Augustine’s Episcopal Church, the Coffee Station at Dumbarton Central train station and Crafts4U in Loch Lomond Galleries.

218121,france24,"From left to right: A Yellow Vest protester, the moment the spire of Notre-Dame Cathedral came crashing down, and the captain of French women's football team Amandine Henry.

The year in France opened and ended with protesters out on the streets as President Emmanuel Macron scraped his way out of the Yellow Vest insurgency, only to land straight into a pension revolt. 2019 saw women battle to stamp out discrimination and abuse in football, procreation rights and everyday life. In between, the world looked on in horror as Notre-Dame Cathedral went up in smoke.

Even by French standards, 2019 was a particularly turbulent year protest-wise. It began with the country in the throes of one of the most potent and contagious protest movements in recent French history – an unconventional insurgency that caught Parisian elites sleeping, rattling the government, baffling commentators, and eventually inspiring copy-cat protests around the world.

Donning the now-famous fluorescent waistcoats that are mandatory in French cars, the Gilets Jaunes (Yellow Vests) staged 52 consecutive weeks of protests against economic hardship, mounting inequality and a discredited political establishment. They manned roundabouts across the country night and day, took to the streets every Saturday, and at their peak appeared to threaten the government’s very survival.

As the movement marked its one-year anniversary in November, the number of Yellow Vests out on the streets had starkly diminished, and Macron could claim to have largely seen off the most formidable challenge of his presidency. But the movement nonetheless left an indelible mark on France, forcing the government into billions of euros of tax breaks, sending a clear warning to the country’s self-styled “Jupiterian” president, and putting neglected swathes of the country back on the map.



Macron’s roadshow

In an attempt to appease – or outmanoeuvre – the Yellow Vests, the French president launched a “Great National Debate”, a vast nationwide consultation designed to inform future policy and breathe new life into French democracy. Macron’s three-month -long Great Debate touched on four main themes: ecological transition, the economy and public spending, democracy and citizenship, and public services. It combined online surveys and citizen debates staged in cities, towns and villages across the country.

Macron’s supporters hailed an unprecedented exercise in direct democracy. But critics complained that the ubiquitous president soon turned the debate into a town-hall roadshow offering him unrivalled media coverage – while the Yellow Vests were kept at bay. Questions were also raised about the transparency of the process and the fate of the mountain of data it produced.

When the government released the findings of the Great National Debate, conveniently claiming they justified its tax-cutting push, two of the Yellow Vests’ key demands were conspicuously absent. One was the reintroduction of a popular wealth tax, which Macron scrapped at the start of his presidency in a move that did much to earn him the moniker “president of the rich”. The other was a so-called “Citizens’ Initiative Referendum”, or RIC, designed to allow citizens to vet government policy proposals.

Instead, the government promised to find ways to amend an existing device, known as the Shared Initiative Referendum (RIP), which comes with stringent conditions that make it very hard to trigger – so hard that it has never been used before. Undaunted, opposition lawmakers from left and right banded together in an attempt to trigger a RIP on Macron’s plans to privatise Paris airports, one of the French state’s “crown jewels”. They cleared a first hurdle in April by gathering enough support in France’s parliament. They now have until March 12, 2020, to do the hard part: persuade a tenth of the electorate – 4.5 million people – to sign a petition backing a referendum.

No sooner had Macron weathered the Yellow Vest onslaught than storm clouds gathered anew – this time fanned by France’s battered but still powerful trade unions. After weeks of fruitless talks on pension reform, unions called a nationwide strike over the government’s plans to overhaul the system. On December 5, workers at rail and public transport companies downed tools in protest at the reform, kicking off weeks of transport paralysis that wreaked havoc on Christmas holiday plans.

The government’s plan to meld France's 42 pension schemes into a single points-based system marks the most sweeping reform yet to a costly but cherished welfare model introduced after World War II. Ministers insist the new system will be more transparent and fairer, in particular for women and low earners, and is critical to plugging a deficit they claim can only widen further. But it has drawn fierce opposition from some public-sector workers who would lose their right to early retirement – and from millions more who are expected to see their benefits cut.

Twelve days into the strike, the government suffered a blow when the “father” of the reform, senior civil servant Jean-Paul Delevoye, was forced to resign under the glare of a transparency scandal. As Christmas neared, polls suggested a small majority of the French supported the strike and blamed the government for the travel woes that dampened the festive season. But with neither side showing any sign of backing down, the standoff looked destined to drag on well into 2020.

While France’s parliament is yet to even start discussing pension reform, lawmakers this year began the process of delivering on another of Macron’s flagship campaign promises: extending the right to medically-assisted procreation (MAP) to all women, a highly sensitive subject in France. Under current rules, single women and lesbian couples are barred from access to fertility treatment. For years this discrimination has forced thousands of women to seek the procedure abroad, and fostered the rise of a thriving underground market for sperm that carries enormous legal and sanitary risks.

In September, France’s lower house of parliament approved a government-sponsored draft law granting all women access to medically-assisted reproduction methods such as in vitro fertilisation, commonly known as IVF. The bill must also get the go-ahead from the upper house, or Senate, before it can become law. Macron has acknowledged the political risk he is taking, and is mindful of the backlash six years ago against gay marriage, when a coalition of grassroots religious groups, Catholic figures and right-wing political opponents organised mass demonstrations against the ruling Socialist government.

Women protesters were a defining feature of 2019: They featured prominently in the Yellow Vest movement, were instrumental to the many climate marches staged in French cities throughout the year, and led the charge for equal access to fertility treatment. In November, feminist movements also organised the biggest ever protest against domestic violence and other forms of gender-based abuse, heaping pressure on the government to act on a scourge Macron has described as “France’s shame”.

On average, one woman dies every three days in France as a result of domestic violence, making it one of the worst-performing countries in Europe when it comes to protecting women from gender-based violence. Seeking to draw attention to this scourge, activists glued posters with the names of the dead onto to the walls of Paris and other French cities. Signs reading “She leaves him, he kills her” or “Daddy killed mummy with knives” became commonplace in the French capital, as did the word “femicide” to refer to misogynist killings by men.

In September, the Justice Ministry released a report acknowledging the authorities’ systematic failure to prevent domestic killings. Vowing to tackle the problem head-on, the government organised ten weeks of consultations with experts and advocacy groups to find ways to tackle domestic abuse. Following the talks, it announced a raft of measures that included stiffer penalties for offenders, expanded use of electronic bracelets, improved training for police officers, and new legislation to take into account psychological forms of harassment.

Experts said stamping out gender-based violence required tackling the “toxic masculinity” that is deeply rooted in mentalities – the kind that is still rampant in football, France’s most popular sport. In that field too, 2019 proved to be a landmark year for women, with France hosting its first ever women’s football World Cup in the summer.

A year after France’s men won the World Cup in Russia, its women were desperate to do the same on home soil. After a disappointing quarter-final defeat, the title eluded them once again. But by most measures, the World Cup was a success, generating unprecedented enthusiasm, packed stadiums and record viewership. In France alone, ten million people watched the opening game on TV, the biggest audience for a women's game ever.

With their track record of crushing norms both for their gender and for their sport, Megan Rapinoe’s trailblazers USA made for fitting victors. However, tournament organisers FIFA were not exempt from criticism, with Norway’s superstar Ada Hegerberg boycotting the event because of entrenched gender inequality, most notably when it comes to pay.



Notre-Dame on fire

In many ways, the biggest story of the year unfolded in the space of a few dramatic hours on April 15, when viewers around the world stared at their screens in shock and awe as a devastating blaze tore through one of the great Paris landmarks. The accidental fire swept across the top of Notre-Dame Cathedral while the soaring Gothic edifice was under renovations, collapsing its spire and consuming its roof as locals and tourists watched aghast from the streets.

The calamitous blaze elicited an unprecedented outpouring of generosity from donors near and far. In just three days, 850 million euros were pledged to rebuild the 850-year-old monument – the speed of donations fuelled by a game of one-upmanship between France’s top culture-minded billionaires. Macron vowed to rebuild Notre-Dame ""even more beautifully"" within five years. But experts said reconstruction could take much longer, while environmental groups warned of a high risk of poisoning from the tons of lead dust released with the flames.

With the gutted structure deemed unsafe, Notre-Dame Cathedral was unable to host Christmas services for the first time since the French Revolution this year. Instead, its exiled clergy, choir and congregation celebrated the holiday in another Gothic church next to the Louvre Museum, with the cathedral’s iconic 14th-century sculpture “The Virgin of Paris,” which survived the fire, on display.

There were more emotional scenes later in the year when thousands bid farewell to former president Jacques Chirac in a ceremony at the Invalides monument in Paris. Chirac’s popularity had seen a remarkable turnaround since he left the presidency in 2007, tarnished by scandal and an undistinguished record in office. Just over a decade later, a majority of the French harboured fond memories of the man affectionately known as “Chichi”.

Charming, statuesque and a consummate political animal, Chirac was a towering presence on the French political arena for more than four decades. His career included two presidential terms, two stints as prime minister and nearly two decades as mayor of Paris. But he is best remembered abroad for his vehement opposition to the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. He was also the first French president to formally recognise the part played by France’s wartime collaborationist regime in the arrest and deportation of tens of thousands of Jews during the Holocaust – this after decades of ambiguity and denial by his predecessors.","Civil unrest, Notre-Dame on fire, and stamping out sexism: 2019 in France","conflict, war and peace",civil unrest,1838

That’s according to a new report from the Congressional Budget Office.

The $8 billion that should be recouped comes from the government reopening and federal workers receiving back pay, the CBO said.

In total, losses amount to a 0.1% reduction in GDP in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 0.2% in the first quarter of 2019. The CBO estimates the lasting economic effects of the shutdown will cause the 2019 level of GDP—the value of all U.S. goods and services— to be 0.02% smaller than it would have been otherwise.

Going forward, the shutdown has lowered the expected annualized economic growth rate by 0.4% in the first quarter of 2019, according to CBO estimates. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the shutdown decreased that rate by 0.2%.

376404,newyorkpost,"JOHANNESBURG — Mozambique says it needs $3.2 billion to recover from a pair of powerful tropical cyclones that ripped into the southern African nation earlier this year and left hundreds dead, raising alarm about the effects of climate change on coastal nations.

That’s according to a government assessment supported by the World Bank, United Nations and European Union for a global pledging conference that begins on Friday.

Some aid workers fear the worst is yet to come. The storms wiped out crops on the eve of harvest in one of the world’s least developed countries, and many people must rely on food aid well into next year. More than 1.3 million people are said to require emergency food assistance.

Cyclones Idai and Kenneth killed more than 650 people in Mozambique, plus hundreds of others in Zimbabwe and Malawi. A final death toll may never be known as some bodies were washed away.

It was the first time in recorded history that two tropical cyclones struck Mozambique in a single season, with one making landfall farther north than ever recorded. The country’s 2,400-kilometer (1,500-mile) Indian Ocean coastline is one of the world’s most vulnerable to global warming .

The cyclones will worsen poverty in the region and recovery will be “extremely challenging,” the government assessment says.

“It’s getting worse with time, steadily,” Mahmoud Shabeeb, spokesman with the aid organization CARE, told The Associated Press, saying the next harvest season isn’t until March of next year. “If people receive assistance, they eat. If not, they don’t eat.”

Cyclone Idai in mid-March brought widespread flooding that created an “inland ocean” and left panicked residents clinging to rooftops and trees for days across central Mozambique, the country’s breadbasket. In the region’s main city of Beira , population roughly 500,000, many rooftops were peeled away.

Six weeks later Kenneth arrived in the northernmost province of Cabo Delgado, shocking residents who had never experienced such a powerful storm. A long swathe of coastal communities was destroyed, and some areas are still difficult or impossible to reach.

“The sound was like a pack of angry wolves,” Ahmad Baroudi, a spokesman with the aid group Save the Children, told the AP after visiting devastated Ibo island and hearing accounts of the storm. Residents told him how they had struggled to put one foot in front of the other in the hurricane-force winds, and how everyone — even those not thought to be religious — were praying.

The cyclones’ effects on children have been widespread, Baroudi said. Fewer are going to school. Some are exposed to abuse and neglect. Some must work or engage in “survival sex.” Many are drinking unsafe water. Livelihoods have been destroyed.

“This response is surprisingly underfunded,” he said. Just 30% of the U.N. humanitarian appeal for Mozambique has come in. “This (pledging) conference comes really at a crucial time.”",Mozambique seeks $3.2 billion to recover from cyclones,weather,weather phenomena,464
765797,theindependent,"The title sponsor of German professional cycling team, Bora, is Hansgrohe SE – one of the world’s largest suppliers of shower heads and hand showers. As the Tour de France begins today in Brussels, one can see the logic of such a deal: hot, sweaty, dusty days followed by a refreshing post-stage soak in the shower.

That should appeal not only to the competing riders, but also to the millions of fans watching the race either from the side of a French road, or on a mobile device or television somewhere in the world. It’s the kind of alignment between team and sponsor that represents a new face of professional cycling, in which business is helping to consign the sport’s greatly tarnished reputation to the past.

It has been some considerable time since Lance Armstrong’s catalogue of misdemeanours began spilling out in dramatic fashion. Even longer still since Marco Pantani staged his sit-down protest on Stage 12 of the 1998 Tour following police raids, as the race organisers hunted down doping products and their associated paraphernalia.

Casting a glance across the 2019 teams, a new and refreshing air of respectability seems to have transcended the carnage of times past. Among this year’s starters, there’s a team sponsored by a Polish shoe store, one by a Dutch supermarket, another by a Spanish mobile phone company. There’s even an international education provider involved with one of the teams. Respectability personified.

Yet in amongst the corporate glitz and commercial bravado of contemporary professional cycling, another story is brewing, and it may reach boiling point during this year’s Tour.

Late last year, Sky announced that it would be withdrawing from its sponsorship of Britain’s most successful ever professional cycling team (Tour Racing Limited). By March, it had been announced that Ineos, a privately owned UK multinational chemicals company, would be replacing Sky. By May, environmental protestors were attending the Tour de Yorkshire to berate the team’s officials and its riders.

Ineos has a controversial environmental profile; the company’s critics accuse it of being responsible for all manner of activities, ranging from the creation of plastic nurdles that pollute the seas to fracking-induced earthquakes that have hit certain parts of Britain. Ineos has said it is investing in equipment and training as part of a “Zero Pellet Loss” strategy, and has argued that UK quake limits are “absurd”. Nevertheless, some commentators have accused it of “sportwashing”, a term used for a company or country perceived to be trying to cleanse its reputation by investing in sport.

Jim Ratcliffe, Ineos’ billionaire owner, has said the sponsorship is “nothing to do with [sportwashing] at all”.

Perhaps just a useful side-effect then. Critics have still raised concern that the Tour de France deflects attention away from the more socially undesirable parts of a business. Ineos is not the only sponsor coming under fire. Fellow fossil fuel sector company Total will be sponsoring a team this year, while many argue that Bahrain-Merida and UAE Team Emirates come with baggage too, perhaps also the likes of the Astana Pro Team, sponsored by Kazakhstan.

Sportwashing is not just synonymous with environmental issues, it is also held to be a political instrument of nations intent on cleansing how the world sees them. Bahrain has long been in the spotlight for its apparent human rights infringements, which is an issue that motor racing teams competing in the country’s F1 Grand Prix have to contend with on an annual basis. Similarly, football clubs like Manchester City are routinely subjected to scrutiny given significant concerns about its owners from Abu Dhabi.

The glitz of professional sport can be a useful distraction from the alleged suppression of free speech, the torture of political prisoners or restrictions on press freedoms. This week the countries and companies with controversial back stories will be associating themselves one of world sport’s biggest events and all the drama, glamour and European continental flair that it brings.

Maybe it’s down to the fans themselves to pause and ask themselves who is doing the sportwashing and why are they doing it.

Fingers wag most keenly at corporate bad guys and political hardmen, but maybe all of the new teams and their glossy sponsors are complicit. Maybe it’s a communal bath.

As the likes of Ineos and Bahrain join the peloton, they in turn help professional cycling turn the power hose on its own deeply troubled past. Could it actually be the case that the biggest sportwasher of them all is cycling itself?

Human rights abuses and environmental issues can’t be forgotten, but nor should memories of the sport’s drugs history. After years of crisis, accompanied by suspicion and cynicism, cycling somehow seems to have ascended to a level of legitimacy and credibility that, even ten years ago, was unimaginable. And yet, several of those involved in perpetrating cycling’s doping culture remain active in the sport. The communal bath looks very crowded at times – everyone hoping the simple purity of human against mountain, against a backdrop of stunning alpine scenery, manages to mask the lingering stench.

On August 15, Jessica Rosenworcel of the Federal Communications Commission spoke about accessibility and inclusion at a conference at Gallaudet University for the deaf and hard of hearing in Washington D.C.

As Commissioner Rosenworcal noted, “the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) was signed into law 29 years ago by former president George H.W. Bush. Upon signing, he famously said: “Let the shameful walls of exclusion finally come tumbling down.” Exactly. Those words ring true today—just as they did in 1990. Because 29 years ago this law laid the foundation for the meaningful inclusion of 60 million Americans with disabilities in all aspects of modern life.” “Title IV of the Americans with Disabilities Act became part of the Communications Act. It tasked the FCC with making sure that telecommunication relay services are widely available…. Access for all was enshrined in the law. A few years later, in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the FCC was tasked by Congress with improving access to communications equipment, ensuring it is designed, developed, and accessible for those with disabilities. Once again, access for all was in the law.”

“The way I see it is that there are three values at the heart of the Americans with Disabilities Act and its successors, like the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act.”

“Second, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, functional equivalency has been the foundation of our telecommunications relay service policies… for millions of Americans with hearing and speech impairments, it means they have the right and ability to pick up the phone, reach out and connect, and participate more fully in the world.”

“Third, inclusion. One area where the FCC has done significant work to promote inclusion involves closed captioning.”

Regarding the ADA, The Federal Communications Commission is Negligent

There is a flip side to the FCC’s promotion of its efforts regarding inclusion and protection of human rights.

The FCC is perhaps the single most powerful force in denying growing evidence of illness and disability, by protecting corporations causing harm.  The FCC is providing justification to those industries actively discriminating against and causing avoidable harm, pain, degeneration, and suffering to a portion of the population: those Americans Becoming Disabled by the FCC.

In a November 18, 2013 joint filing to the FCC, the cities of Boston and Philadelphia accused the FCC and federal health agencies of negligence for failing to investigate whether electrosensitive persons are harmed by non-ionizing radiation.

As noted in the joint filing, in 1999-2000 the FCC had already begun a pattern of systematically ignoring evidence of the need for protections of electro-sensitive individuals.

Then, in March of 2013, the FCC’s office of Engineering and Technology opened Docket 13-84 Reassessment of Federal Communications Commission Radiofrequency Exposure Limits and Policies and ignored the preponderance of over 1,000 testimonies indicating that FCC limits are inadequate and that radio frequency exposure is linked to other adverse health effects, including cancer, infertility, DNA damage, and neurodegenerative conditions.

The pattern of neglect has accelerated with current plans for the rollout of 5G fifth generation telecommunications infrastructure, using faster millimeter wave frequencies and requiring extensive antenna densification, especially near homes, and already being mounted on lampposts and utility poles across the country.

Many of the expert submissions submitted to the FCC and ignored by the FCC indicating the need for new science-based exposure limits are indexed by Joel Moskowitz on the website Electromagnetic Radiation Safety.

In her speech at Gallaudet, Commissioner Rosenworcel noted that hearing-impaired individuals now “have the right and ability to pick up the phone, reach out and connect, and participate more fully in the world.”

Meanwhile, a marginalized population not only can’t participate in the world; these individuals do not have the right or ability to protect their health in their own homes. (And as the FCC eliminates copper landline phones individuals requiring corded landline access will not be able to pick up a phone anytime, anywhere.)

Due to lack of federal response, health-vulnerable residents are placed in the position of having to beg for consideration from utility companies, public servants, telecommunications companies, communities, and neighbors. This has resulted in an environment where the protection of human rights and health is uneven at best, with most of the affected individuals usually being systematically bullied and ignored.

For example, the forced installation of wireless gas, water, and electric meters has reportedly caused the acute onset of electromagnetic sensitivity in some individuals, while exacerbating health challenges and symptoms in others. (Lyme and MCS Multiple Chemical Sensitivity patients are among the populations that have been noted to be at risk of developing EHS and requiring protection, as well as those with compromised immunity.)

No scientific research regarding environmental impacts or human health was conducted prior to the rollout of wireless smart meters and smart grid infrastructure. Subsequently, wireless electric meters have been demonstrated to alter the human heart rate in some individuals.

In 2010, Magda Havas published peer-reviewed research demonstrating that DECT cordless phones cause heart rate alterations in some individuals.

Nonetheless, in 2019 in Massachusetts, a resident of Plymouth County with a heart condition for which she was recently hospitalized provided a letter from her physician to her town water department. Her physician stated that she needed to receive an opt out from the wireless water meter. The town was notified of her low blood pressure challenges, and informed that lack of access to water would present a serious dehydration and health risk.

In May of 2019, when she did not comply with an installation demand, the town shut off her water, causing both hygiene and dehydration risks during the peak heat summer months. The household remains without water despite reaching out to many agencies in the Commonwealth, including the disabilities board, attorney general, department of health, and elected officials.

In California, “Plumas Sierra Rural Electric Co-Operative (PSREC) disconnected electricity to the family of Stop Smart Meters! Director Josh Hart in February 2014 for refusing to pay the extortionate ‘opt out fee.’

However, on July 2nd, 2015, 16 months later, the electricity was restored to the Harts, and opt out fees dropped after an appeal hearing in Superior Court.

How and why are corporations practicing medicine without a license by overriding the health expertise of medical professionals, in favor of profit, and ignoring accommodation requests?  Thanks to the FCC.

With the federal regulator FCC firmly entrenched with the industry, where no state protection is in place, the accommodation decision is often left to the town, or the utility provider.

Many towns including Southborough, MA threatened water shut-offs if customers did not accept a transmitting water meter.

In Holyoke, Massachusetts, a yearlong effort was required by Kirstin Beatty of Last Tree Laws, who was diagnosed with electrosensitivity by three different doctors. She requested removal of wireless gas and electric utility meters. “Brian Beuregard, an employee, was kind enough to find me an alternative [non-transmitting electric and gas] meter and respond to numerous emails.” When the transmissions stopped, her health improved, white blood cells rose, and her nausea and headache decreased.

Like many, Kirstin had to pay for her non-transmitting meter.

Often a meter read fee is levied. The town of Acton, MA surcharges customers who desire an opt out meter a $25 fee per reading cycle (currently quarterly) and a fee to remove the wireless water meter.  After years of contentious opposition at Town Meeting, Wayland, MA approved wireless water meters and intends to charge $20 per quarter to read the meter. Everett, MA also accommodated a resident request for accommodation, and charges $20 per quarter.

Nearby Melrose charges $50 per quarter year for the water meter opt out reading. Given that many customers with environmental health challenges including MCS and EHS have difficulty finding work and are low income customers, the surcharge is especially punishing and discriminatory, especially if the meter’s 24/7/365 pulsed frequencies caused the environmental overload in the first place. There is no research indicating that the meters are not causing adverse symptoms.

Health vulnerable homeowners with gas, water, and electric meters are faced with the prospect of having to pay protection money times three for access to essential services. Extra fees for meter reads are unnecessary and unjustified, as many jurisdictions offer the option to self-report via postcard. Were protections in place under the ADA, the punitive surcharges would be illegal.

Most jurisdictions have relied on industry claims and FCC “protections.” Only in rare cases have towns been graciously accommodating. Concerned residents in Manchester, Massachusetts who contacted the town were immediately offered the option of disconnecting the wireless transmitter and self-reporting their water readings to the town at no fee.

Massachusetts electric utility Eversource has provided no accommodation for residents seeking a non-transmitting meter, claiming that analogs are not available, despite the fact that Maine customers can pay a surcharge to retain an analog meter. Analogs are also available for purchase on the internet.

Investor-owned utility National Grid petitioned the MA Dept. of Public Utilities in 2013 to surcharge customers seeking to opt out of gas and electric meters, securing a fee of $26 to remove each meter and $11 month for meter reads, even for months when the meter is not read. (MA DPU 13-83)

Yet the opt-out meter does not address all of the health risk factors. Electronic meters introduce both wireless radio frequency exposures and high voltage transients that can ride on the household wiring and plumbing. Electrical engineer Bill Bathgate and others have explained that the design of modern wireless meters can pollute the electrical wiring in homes with other frequencies, leading to harmonics and transients. In his book Dirty Electricity Dr. Samuel Milham discusses how a clean 60-hertz wave can be disrupted, and how these disruptions are statistically linked to poor health. Modern wireless meters and many energy efficient devices use a switch mode power, which adds “dirty electricity” and disrupts power quality. This also reduces the lifetime of electronics. If no analog is offered, customers are being forced to pay a fee and then provided with a meter that only addresses part of their concerns.

Mass Save recently provided an energy audit for the home of an EHS individual who has paid nearly $1,000 in surcharges to National Grid over the years for an opt out meter. Mass Save replaced her lights with “energy efficient” LED bulbs that polluted the power quality in the home. This caused the resident to experience a dramatic downturn in her health, until the lighting was removed. (The Building Biology Institute offers many tools for assisting individuals and buildings in healthy building design, including lighting.) Assessing Impacts of Wireless, We Need to Have Our Heads Examined When individuals have reported harm due to proximity to smart meters, smart infrastructure, solar inverters, variable speed motors, LED lighting, dimmer switches, and proximal telecommunications infrastructure including towers and antennas, the industry has responded by simply measuring the transmissions against outdated and inapplicable FCC limits. This is both inhumane and unscientific. The FCC tests cellphones by taking the temperature of a plastic head filled with the equivalent of Jell-O. Now it appears that the FDA has joined forces with the FCC to utilize manufactured tissue samples for “health research.”  This is simply mad science.  It is not only contributing to unrelenting suffering, but it is a massive waste of resources. Rather than addressing infrastructure repairs for issues like lead in the water and gas leaks, the nation was misguided into buying into a surveillance system masquerading as sustainability. It would be absurd to have a fire alarm send a message every 2,000th of a second that there is no fire, and to build massive data centers to analyze the data, and to pay technocrats to analyze and monetize the data.  There is only a need for a transmission in the case of a fire.  The wireless industry has been allowed to build a burgeoning demand for wireless infrastructure through frivolous use of technology. The massive collection of consumption and usage data is a wrong turn for humanity. We’re revisiting the point in history when all the doctors were smoking, and cigarettes were promoted for digestive issues or a sore throat. We are letting the wrong people ask the wrong questions, including the tobacco scientist shills now working for the wireless industry.  This is no longer a question of whether or not or how to accommodate the canaries in the coalmine; it is whether or not we will rethink the entire belief system held by the consumer culture about the safety of wireless devices, as cities and towns are overloaded with transmitters. And, this is a basic question about human rights. Human experimentation went awry at other times in history. It is off the rails again. “In a herd of deer, we need some super-sensitive ones. They are the ones that will hear that teeniest little crack, or smell the one or two molecules of scent from the mountain lion that’s stalking them. Their job is to use their hyper-sensitivity to alert the whole group.” ~ Peter Levine If we do not address the charade at the FCC, we will burden future generations with unfathomable injury and incalculable harm. Albert Einstein is credited with the quote, “It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.” In the meantime, public servants and decision makers have the opportunity to do the right thing in their own communities, by challenging the incomplete and corrupted science, calling for independent research, dropping the surcharges, and turning the water and power back on. “Let the shameful (and idiotic) walls of exclusion finally come tumbling down.” Register Now for The 5G Crisis: Awareness & Accountability Summit.

160740,eveningstandard,"Greenland is melting faster than scientists previously thought with its ice being lost nearly four times more quickly than in 2003, a study has found.

The findings suggest the ice sheet has reached “tipping point”, with the lead author of the study claiming humanity may have passed the point of no return in the fight against climate change.

Researchers have warned of rising sea levels caused by the melting glaciers.

The findings could have dire implications for coastal cities in the US, including New York and Miami, as well as island nations that are particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels, the study said.

“The only thing we can do is adapt,” Michael Bevis, professor of geodynamics and lead author of The Ohio State University's study, said. “It’s too late for there to be no effect.

""This is going to cause additional sea level rise. We are watching the ice sheet hit a tipping point.”

Scientists concerned about sea level rise have long focused on Greenland’s southeast and northwest regions, where large glaciers stream iceberg-sized chunks of ice into the Atlantic Ocean.

But the new study found that the largest sustained ice loss from early 2003 to mid-2013 came from Greenland’s southwest region, which is mostly devoid of large glaciers.

That melting, which Mr Bevis and his co-authors believe is largely caused by global warming, means that in the southwestern part of Greenland, growing rivers of water are streaming into the ocean during summer.

Published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the study determined that southwest Greenland, previously not considered a serious threat, will likely become a major future contributor to sea level rise.

“We knew we had one big problem with increasing rates of ice discharge by some large outlet glaciers,” Mr Bevis said. “But now we recognize a second serious problem - increasingly, large amounts of ice mass are going to leave as meltwater, as rivers that flow into the sea. And there is no turning back.”

Patterns found by scientists revealed ice was being lost at nearly four times the rate that prevailed in 2003, with the biggest acceleration in southwest Greenland.

The natural weather phenomenon North Atlantic Oscillation, which brings warmed air to west Greenland, was building on man-made climate change to cause “unprecedented levels of melting and runoff”, Mr Bevis said.

The North Atlantic Oscillation is a natural cycle that causes ice to melt under normal circumstances. However, when combined with man-made global warming the effects are supercharged.

“These oscillations have been happening forever,” Mr Bevis added. “So why only now are they causing this massive melt? It’s because the atmosphere is, at its baseline, warmer. The transient warming driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation was riding on top of more sustained, global warming.”

Mr Bevis said these new findings show that scientists need to be watching the island’s snowpack and ice fields more closely, especially in and near southwest Greenland.

“We’re going to see faster and faster sea level rise for the foreseeable future,” he said. “Once you hit that tipping point, the only question is: How severe does it get?”","Greenland&apos;s ice melting faster than scientists previously thought, study finds",environment,climate change,502
287781,lewrockwell,"Why have the biggest and most profitable American corporations embraced leftist politics, as seen in their woke advertising and social justice activism? Hint: It’s not because they’ve become non-profits and taken up philanthropy.

Judging by the Ted Talks of woke American CEOs, by the woke corporate advertising, and by the public relations campaigns promoting corporate ‘brand activism,’ one might reasonably conclude that the most successful, for-profit corporate giants in America have gone out of the money-making business to become centers of leftist political propaganda. And it’s not only the most woke corporate behemoths that promote leftist political notions. Go to a startup crowdfunding portal and count how many times the word “democratizing” is used to describe the mission of the startups there, or how many startup investments are pitched with the supposedly progressive political outlook of the prospective investor in mind.

What one encounters – from the boardrooms to the storyboards and beyond – is a nauseating, woke-up blend of equal parts Communist Manifesto, social justice handbook, sanctimonious sermon and used car sales pitch. Google Archipelago: Th... Michael Rectenwald Best Price: $14.76 Buy New $14.60

Just why has corporate America gone woke (while not yet broke)? Below, I run-down some of the possible explanations for woke capitalism or corporate leftism – from five to one – with five being the least compelling and one being the most.

5. The bosses are woke themselves. CEOs and other corporate executives went to business schools that weren’t that far away from social science and humanities departments. Business professors became friends with humanities and social science professors, who are notoriously left-leaning. Their leftism rubbed off on the business professors, who then spread it to their students, who went on to run corporate America.

4. To pander to their clients. Corporate leftism pleases the corporate customers with the most disposable income, those between 25 and 54, who likely live on the east and west coasts. This demographic includes millennials, whose politics are notoriously left-leaning. Choosing these “coastal elites” over the deplorables in “flyover states” has been an easy decision. The deplorables have less money anyway and they can go to hell if they don’t like corporate wokeness.

3. Being woke is easier than actually paying workers. Corporate wokeness acts as a placebo, a substitute for economic concessions by corporations. The statements of woke CEOs, the woke ads, the woke activism – these cost a lot less than higher wages and better benefits for workers, or lower prices for customers. Plus, the dummies seem to fall for it every time.

2. To keep the government wolf from the door. Woke capitalism appeases the political elite, putting corporations in the good favor of liberal lawmakers, in the hopes of favorable treatment from the latter. As liberals, these political operatives are more likely to impose burdensome regulations or to initiate anti-trust legislation that would pose big problems. Why not tell them what they want to hear?

1. Wokeness is itself part of globalist capitalism. Leftist politics are perfectly compatible with and supportive of the agendas of global corporate giants. Global corporations and leftist activists want the very same things:

· Globalism – or, in Marxist terms, “internationalism” – has always been a goal of the left and it has become a goal of multinational corporations. The latter extend their markets far and wide while the former think it advances the Marxist objective of “workers of the world unite!” Springtime for Snowfla... Michael Rectenwald Check Amazon for Pricing.

· Unrestricted immigration: Provides cheap labor for corporations and makes leftists feel politically edgy and morally superior for being anti-racists who welcome everyone – whatever their race, religion, gender or sexual orientation – including Mexican gang members running drugs and children? – into the country, but not to camp out in their living rooms.

· Transgenderism or polygenderism, the leading edge of leftist identity politics, is also good for business. It creates new niche markets for corporate products, keeps the workforce divided, and distracts leftists with daily arcana and absurdities.

· Getting rid of nations, stable gender, the family, Western culture and (why not?) Christianity – the hallmarks of leftist “progress” and avant garde politicking – also advances global corporatist objectives, removing any remaining obstacles to global corporate dominance.",This Is the Big Reason Why Corporate America Has Gone Woke (plus 4 more),science and technology,social sciences,696
494438,sottnet,"Medical doctors conducting scientific research are not accurately disclosing their financial ties to pharmaceutical and health care companies when their studies are published in medical journals, according to a recent article published by ProPublica in collaboration with The New York Times.A number of these doctors are prominent figures in the medical field. One example is Howard A. ""Skip"" Burris III, MD the president-elect of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Dr. Burris declared that he has no conflicts of interest in over fifty journal articles, including those articles in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine.However, ProPublica reported that pharmaceutical companies paid his employer, Sarah Cannon Research Institute in Nashville, Tennessee approximately $114,000 for his speaking and consulting engagements and almostfor his research during the time period when the disclosure of financial relationships and industry was required. One of those journals was the Journal of Clinical Oncology, published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the medical trade group he was elected to head.Another top breast cancer doctor, José Baselga, MD, the former chief medical officer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and one of the editors-in-chief for the journal Cancer Discovery, failed to disclose conflict of interests with drug companies in numerous journal articles including articles in The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine.In September 2018, Dr. Baselga resigned from his position as the chief medical officer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center after ProPublica and The New York Times reported that he failed to disclose his financial ties to drug companies.In response to public pressure, Baselga also resigned from his position as one of the editors-in-chief for Cancer Discovery.One doctor critical of physician scientists who fail to disclose their financial ties to drug companies, Jeffrey Botkin, MD, associate vice president for research at the University of Utah, authored a viewpoint in The Journal of the American Medical Association.He wrote, ""They really are falsifying the information that others rely on to assess that research..""In addition to identifying several other top physician scientists who failed to disclose conflicts of interest in medical journals, ProPublica reported that medical journals often give confusing advice and inconsistent rules on disclosing financial conflicts of interest and do not routinely vet the authors of the journal articles.It is no secret that relationships between the medical establishment and pharmaceutical companies involve significant financial entanglement that raises conflict of interest issues.5 In 2009, the Institute of Medicine published a report, Conflicts of Interest in Medical Research, Education and Practice, that pointed out flaws in the system of how study authors report conflicts of interests in medical journals and the influence of pharmaceutical industry money in medical education and practice.Financial incentives provided by drug companies have long influenced medical doctors to engage in inappropriate pharmaceutical product prescribing habits to promote the purchase and use of the sponsoring company's prescription drugs, which calls into question the integrity and credibility of both medical doctors and drug companies.But this same type of relationship has also become very prominent between the pharmaceutical industry physician scientists (medical doctors who also conduct research in addition to being in clinical practice), which poses serious problems for the objectivity and integrity of published scientific research. The credibility of scientific research findings published in medical journals is even further compromised when scientists fail to disclose financial ties to the drug company paying for the research.A significant amount of vaccine related research is now being conducted by physician scientists at prominent U.S. universities and medical institutions receiving both pharmaceutical industry money and NIH grants to develop and market vaccines.Professors and physician-scientists who conduct these studies can have personal financial relationships with vaccine manufacturers but, as pointed out in the article by ProPublica, a study author's financial conflicts of interest with a pharmaceutical company may or may not be revealed in the original publication in which results of the scientific research is reported.Concerns have been voiced about the pharmaceutical industry's lack of transparency with regard to the development and side effects of FDA licensed vaccines and drugs and financial relationships with medical doctors, who promote the use of those products. It is logical to ask whether the public can trust the conclusions of vaccine research conducted by physician-scientists heavily funded by vaccine manufacturers, who may also receive grants from government agencies developing and marketing vaccines, which may incentivize vaccine researchers to design and conduct research steered toward toward conclusions that align with the financial interests of industry and affirm the safety of and effectiveness of government vaccine use policy and law.The oligopoly of medical journal publishes dominating the reporting of scientific research also has important implications for the scientific and medical communities, as well as federal health agencies that rely upon the validity of scientific research to make medical and government policy. The autonomy of peer reviewed scientific research conducted by physician scientists in previous decades before consolidation of medical journal publishers owned by big corporations has gradually diminished.Corporate owned publishers have gained control over the type of scientific research and content that gets published in medical journals and this has led to a trend toward restricting published ""science"" to that which is both politically correct and favors the interests of the pharmaceutical and medical trade industries.The recent investigative report by ProPublica confirms the legitimacy of published concerns about the financial collaboration between pharmaceutical companies, physician scientists and medical journal publishers, and the credibility of medical policy and public health laws, including vaccine policy and law, based on or influenced by scientific research published in medical journals.",Physician scientists fail to disclose Big Pharma conflicts of interest in medical journals,science and technology,scientific research,923
687893,theguardianuk,"Thousands of deaths and the wrecking of many lives by disability could be averted if doctors routinely offered a daily statin pill to older people, scientists say.

They blame misinformation about the side-effects of statins, together with society’s ageism, for the low uptake among older people, who are at highest risk of heart attacks, heart failure and stroke.

There are 5.5 million people aged over 75 in the UK, of whom about 1.5 million take a statin. If the rest did so too, about 8,000 additional deaths from cardiovascular events could be prevented, said Prof Colin Baigent, director of the Medical Research Council population health research unit at Oxford University.

More than two-thirds of the 150,000 cardiovascular deaths in the UK each year are in people over 75.

Baigent said there were good reasons why some would not want to take statins, for instance if they had terminal cancer or certain other medical conditions, but the pills were safe and effective and should be offered.

“It is not just about preventing deaths,” he said. “Death is the least of people’s worries when they are elderly. They are more worried about being disabled. Talking to elderly relatives, it is the thing they want to avoid.” He said disability following stroke and heart failure could massively impair people’s quality of life.

Baigent said statins had wrongly become controversial because of misinformation about side-effects. “We have people saying that 20% of those taking a statin get side-effects, which is clear misinformation. It is fake news,” he said. “We have seen, as a result of that, a lot of concern about people being on too much treatment, but it is predicated on the idea that it is doing them harm. That is misinformation.”

The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ Collaboration, a project based at Oxford University, has collected data from clinical trials of statins involving 200,000 patients over the last 25 years. Baigent said researchers know what the rare, big hazards of statins are, such as myopathy, which causes muscle weakness. Because of the concerns, they are now examining the data on side-effects and will report probably at the end of the year.

“It is very unlikely that any hazards exist that we don’t already know about,” Baigent said. “The debate about whether statins are associated with particular hazards has got out of control and is blinding us to the clear evidence that we already have.”

People have become muddled by claims of side-effects based not on randomised controlled trials but on observational studies – the reports of patients who know what drug they are taking and assume any pains they feel are down to the pills. “Non-randomised studies are extremely susceptible to bias,” Baigent said. “They are extremely unreliable.”

He said ageism among doctors and society as a whole was also preventing older people from being offered statins. There was an attitude that “a person is elderly, so something is going to happen to them, so why bother?”

The collaboration analysed data from 28 randomised controlled trials involving a total of 186,854 patients, 14,483 of whom were aged over 75. The findings are published in the Lancet medical journal.

Statins reduce the levels of LDL, or “bad” cholesterol, in the blood, measured in millimoles per litre. The study found that for every reduction of 1mmol/L, the risk of a cardiovascular event (heart attack or stroke) dropped by a fifth across all age groups.

The risk reduction was lower in the over 75s than in younger people but still a substantial benefit, the scientists said, because older people are at higher risk.

“Even if risk reduction in people older than 75 years is less than expected, statin therapy may still be justified by a high baseline cardiovascular risk, which is usually present in older people,” writes Bernard Cheung, of the Queen Mary hospital at the University of Hong Kong, in a comment article in the journal.

“The present meta-analysis makes a case to reduce LDL cholesterol in people at risk of cardiovascular events regardless of age, provided that the benefits outweigh the risks and the patient accepts long term treatment.”

Prof Sir Nilesh Samani, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: “Concern has been raised about the benefits of statins in older people. This large analysis provides powerful evidence that statins reduce heart attacks and strokes in older people, as they do in younger people, and are safe.

“Age should not be a barrier to prescribing these potentially life-saving drugs to people who are likely to benefit.”",'Fake news and ageism' keeping statins from older people,society,discrimination,735
687783,theguardianuk,"Forget about athleisure, ugly trainers and logomania, the most dominant trend to have gripped the masses in recent years isinteriors. The fashion world is currently consumed by a homeware obsession – making the “shelfie” the new selfie.

It’s not a hard trend to hunt down. On social media, aesthetically pleasing backgrounds now get at least as much attention as the outfits we post photographs of. Elsewhere on our feeds, Peggy Guggenheim’s terrazzo-tiled palazzo in Venice, the quiet sophistication of Kettle’s Yard in Cambridge and the sugary millennial-pink interior of the tea room at Sketch in London are just as likely to be pictured as a new pair of shoes. The hashtag #IHaveThisThingWithTiles has become as commonplace as #TodayI’mWearing, while Le Corbusier is the new Calvin Klein and Charlotte Perriand the new Prada.

The two worlds have merged to create complementary – if co-dependant – style statements and, as a host of established players enter the fray, buying a cushion with your coat is set to become cheaper and more accessible than ever. Hot on the heels of River Island launching its 160-piece in-house collection last September (its head of homeware, Dayna Sofair declared that “style doesn’t end at our clothes”), Asos launches its first homeware line, Supply, next Monday. River Island promises that “customers will be able to shop the looks [priced between £6 for a mug to £275 for a rug] easily and refresh and update their home seasonally” just as they would with their wardrobes. Similarly, Asos’s “living” range, which starts at £8, is “inspired by seasonal trends and packed with innovative pieces for your home that are as individual as you are”.

“It’s a natural extension of accessorising in fashion in the way you might buy something to cheer an outfit up; the equivalent is buying a cushion for your sofa or a vase for your mantlepiece,” says Vogue’s fashion features editor, Ellie Pithers. She too credits Instagram for the rate at which we are consuming images of people’s houses, hence increasing our appetite for interiors (witness the Italian fashion brand Bottega Veneta this week releasing its spring 2019 campaign, in which the chrome and snakeskin chair the model sat on stole the show). “The next stage of showing off your good taste is extended to your house.”

The new offering from Asos – which self-identifies as “a global fashion destination for 20-somethings” – promises to work, says Pithers, because it is targeting young trend-driven shoppers who don’t have a lot of space or money. “They haven’t focused on big furniture, because their customers are students who don’t have big flats.” Instead, they can “buy a standard sofa from Ikea then beautify it with lots of nice little bits”, such as placing a wicker wastepaper basket, a printed plate or a water jug nearby. River Island’s bestsellers so far – a coaster, a planter and a leopard-print mug –chime with this psychology.

That the popularity of interiors has coincided with the rise of the Swedish H&M group on the high street is no coincidence. The group capitalised on the mid-century Scandinavian aesthetic – one of the most prevailing interiors trends of this century – by bottling the formula, firstly through its H&M Home brand and then with Arket, which launched in 2017. “Arket has been clever,” says Pithers. “The way they have the homewares by the till. Instead of buying a chocolate bar on the way out of the newsagent, you’re buying a little vase or a pack of matches that doesn’t cost very much and cheers you up.”

When it comes to fashion, quick-fix, fast interiors are the new food for thought. And they’re always ready for a close-up.

768211,theindependent,"Thousands of fish have died after an unknown source polluted a 9.3-mile stretch of the River Sheppey in Somerset.

The Wessex branch of the Environment Agency said it had tracked the pollution to a “probable source” and were working to protect the lower end of the river.

“But the pollution has likely killed thousands of fish and invertebrates,” the agency wrote in a Facebook post.

The agency also thanked an unnamed local child, who had noticed the dead fish and alerted them to it.

752554,theindependent,"China’s birth rate in several regions, including the capital Beijing, fell again in 2018, the official China Daily said on Friday, despite government efforts to encourage couples to have more children.

Alarmed by the rapid ageing of its population, China relaxed its controversial “one-child policy” in 2016, allowing all couples to have two children instead of just one.

The change has failed to reverse what demographers say is a long-term trend of falling birth rates fuelled by growing prosperity and concerns about the high cost of raising children.

Beijing’s birth rate fell to 8.24 per 1,000 people in 2018 compared to 9.06 in the previous year, China Daily said, citing figures from local authorities.

In the financial capital Shanghai, the birth rate dropped to 7.2 per 1,000, from 8.1 in 2017.

Beijing’s total population fell for a second straight year in 2018, dropping 170,000 to 21.54 million people, though the decline could also be due to new policies aimed at shifting “non-capital functions” out of the city, China Daily said.

The birth rate in Liaoning, a rustbelt province where the population has dropped in recent years due to an exodus of young people, fell to 6.39 per 1,000, from 6.49 in 2017.

China recorded 15.23 million births last year, down two million from 2017 and the second consecutive annual decline, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

Marriage rates are also falling throughout China, with the ratio of newly-registered marriages in the total population down to 0.72 per cent last year from 0.99 per cent in 2013, NBS data showed.

China’s ageing problem was on the minds of delegates to the annual session of parliament this month, where some called for radical new measures to encourage new births.

Think tanks expect China’s population to peak at 1.4 billion in 2029 and then begin an “unstoppable” decline that could reduce the workforce by as many as 200 million people by the middle of the century.

By 2050, China’s dwindling number of workers will be under pressure to support more than 400 million people aged 60 or over, putting the country’s pension, health and social service provisions under immense strain, experts say.

741519,theindependent,"A museum in Israel will remove an artwork depicting Ronald McDonald as the crucified Jesus after it sparked violent clashes between police and members of the country’s Arab Christian minority.

The life-sized sculpture of fast food chain McDonald’s clown mascot on a cross, created by Finnish artist Jani Leinonen, was due to go on display in the city of Haifa for several months.

However, the piece sparked protests, which became violent on Friday, when three police officers were injured as dozens of demonstrators tried to force their way into the Haifa Museum of Art.

One person was arrested on suspicion of assault after clashes outside the gallery, while investigators are searching for two other individuals suspected of throwing firebombs at the building.

“I object to this disgraceful sculpture,” said Nicola Abdo, a Haifa resident and protester. “As a Christian person, I take deep offence to this depiction of our symbols.”

Christian Arabs, who make up around two per cent of Israel’s population, initially won support for their cause from the country’s populist culture minister Miri Regev.

Ms Regev, who won plaudids on the right for censuring art deemed pro-Palestinian, threatened to cut state funding for the museum on the grounds it had offended religious sensitivities.

However, Israel’s justice ministry rebuked her suggestion, claiming she did not have authority to take such actions.

The mayor of Haifa, Einat Kalisch-Rotem, announced in a tweet late on Wednesday McJesus would be taken out of the exhibition following consultations with church leaders.

“The sculpture will be removed and returned as soon as possible,” Einat Kalish Rotem tweeted.

“We regret the aggravation the Christian community experienced and the physical injury and violence that surrounded it.”

Artist Mr Leionen, known for his public artworks criticising capitalism using the branding and logos of multinational corporations, has also demanded the artwork be removed from the exhibition.

He told Israeli newspaper Haaretz he had asked the museum to take the piece off display last September because he wanted to show solidarity with Palestinians.

The sculptor accused the country of using art and culture to “whitewash and justify” the occupation of the West Bank.

Meanwhile, some in the city see the decision to remove the artwork as an opportunity for reconciliation between religious groups.

“The winner today is the people of Haifa,” said Wadie Abu Nassar, an adviser to local church leaders. “The removal of this sculpture is a reflection our desire to coexist in the city.”",Israel museum removes sculpture depicting Ronald McDonald as Jesus after violent protests,"arts, culture, entertainment and media",culture,384

696983,theguardianuk,"Two thousand Zambian villagers who say their lives have been ruined by toxic runoff from the world’s second-largest opencast mine have won the right to pursue a claim through the English courts.

In a landmark judgment, the supreme court ruled that the mining conglomerate Vedanta Resources, which is based in London, and its Zambian subsidiary Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) can be held to account by English judges, despite the companies’ arguments that they should defend themselves in Zambia.

The decision opens the doors to a range of other cases to be brought against parent companies based in the UK for the actions of their subsidiaries overseas. Oliver Holland, associate solicitor at Leigh Day, who represented the Zambians, said: “I can see companies around London looking at their policies and thinking: what’s going to happen now?”

Cases against Royal Dutch Shell, Unilever and BHP Billiton over allegations of polluting communities in developing countries have been awaiting a decision in the Vedanta case before they can proceed.

The case was brought by 1,826 residents of the Chingola region, in Zambia’s Copperbelt province, who say that effluent from the Nchanga opencast mine has polluted their water supplies.

A vast operation covering nearly 30 sq km, the copper mine and its processing plant lie close to the Kafue River and its tributaries. Local farmers and fisherman claim to have suffered continual pollution since Vedanta bought KCM in 2004, including an incident in 2006 which they say turned the Kafue bright blue with copper sulphate and acid, and poisoned water sources for 40,000 people.

Chemicals believed to be draining into the local water supply include heavy metals such as lead and cadmium, which the claimants say have led to them suffering chronic illnesses and deaths.

“The villagers live close to the river, which we say that the effluent goes into, so it’s polluting their water sources and farmland,” Holland said. “They are saying they have to drink polluted water because there is no other water source.”

James Nyasulu from Chingola, a long term campaigner in the case, said the decision will finally enable thousands of victims of pollution to seek justice. “Their livelihoods, land and health have been irreparably damaged by pollution which has rendered the River Kafue completely polluted and unable to support aquatic life.”

The claimants first issued their case in the hight court in London in 2015, claiming negligence and breach of statutory duty over the release of effluent, but before it could proceed Vedanta challenged the jurisdiction of the English courts. The supreme court’s decision on Wednesday confirmed rulings in both the high court and the court of appeal.

A key point in the case were claims in company literature published by Vedanta – a £10bn company – that it took responsibility for environmental and sustainability standards across the group. It had agreed to submit to action in the Zambian courts alongside KCM, but the supreme court justices agreed with the claimants’ argument that there was a risk they may not have access to justice in Zambia, and so allowed the case against both companies to be heard in England.

“Had it not been for the access to justice problem, this court would therefore have refused the claimants permission to serve these English proceedings out of the jurisdiction upon KCM in Zambia,” Lord Briggs told the court. “As it is, however, the non-availability of access to justice in Zambia means that the proceedings against both defendants must continue in England.”

A spokesperson for Vedanta and KCM said the judgment was a procedural one relating to the jurisdiction of the case. “It is not a judgment on the merits of the claims,” the spokesperson said. “Vedanta and KCM will defend themselves against any such claims at the appropriate time.”

17511,aljazeera,"Antofagasta, Chile - Opposition legislators in Chile formally presented a motion Tuesday to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Sebastian Pinera.

The ""constitutional accusation"" is rooted in human rights violations allegedly committed during the ongoing month-long crisis. Nationwide protests against inequality and injustice continue, as do police crackdowns.
• Chile agrees to hold referendum on constitution: 5 things to know

The accusation is ""due to the grave, repeated, generalised and systematic violations of the fundamental rights of people carried out by agents of the state in the past month,"" opposition legislator Carmen Hertz said Tuesday in a public statement announcing the motion presented by representatives from several left-wing parties.

Constitutional accusations need between 10 and 20 backers to proceed. Tuesday's had 11, but a previous attempt by a different political force failed to gather the minimum 10 signatures. The motion is unlikely, however, to gain majority support among legislators to move forward.

The human rights situation has compromised the honour of the nation, said Hertz, referring to one of the constitutional bases for impeachment. Should the accusation proceed from a commission of randomly selected legislators and eventually be passed by both levels of the bicameral congress, Pinera would be removed from office.

""It is not possible that this country continue with political impunity, moral impunity and social impunity, which has been a very important component in triggering social protests,"" said Hertz.

In a statement Sunday night, Pinera acknowledged there were cases of abuses by security forces and instances when human rights were not respected.

""In some cases, protocols were not respected. There was excessive use of force. Abuses or crimes were committed,"" he said, adding that the government is committed to investigating and prosecuting those cases.

Secondary student protests last month against a Santiago subway fare rise sparked nationwide mass protests that hit the month mark on Monday. Pinera deployed the military during a nine-day state of emergency in October, and police have been cracking down on protests throughout the crisis.

Calls for Pinera's resignation were scrawled in graffiti on walls in cities around the country. Some protesters, social movements and opposition politicians have also been calling for the resignation of Police chief Mario Rozas.

Over the past month, human rights groups have repeatedly claimed that human rights violations have been systemic, not isolated incidents. Ruling and opposition politicians announced a ""peace agreement"" on Friday and a plan for a new constitution, but the police crackdown on demonstrators has continued.

At least 24 people have been killed amid the crisis, including five by military and police forces. The National Human Rights Institute has filed 384 legal actions against state entities, including 273 for alleged torture and other cruel treatment.

The institute has documented 2,391 people hospitalised for injuries, including 222 with severe eye injuries, roughly 75 percent of which were caused by projectiles fired by security forces. The institute has also visited 6,362 people detained in custody, including 759 minors.

""There's a policy of terror,"" said Juan Hun, 50, a consultant in Antofagasta, a city 1,400km (860 miles) north of the capital.

""The government is criminalising social movements, students, and residents,"" he told Al Jazeera.

Thousands of Chileans rallied on Monday to mark one month since protests began. In Antofagasta, police used tear gas and a water cannon on a march, but protesters regrouped. Police filled a downtown plaza with tear gas to disperse the crowd, and scattered protests, barricades, skirmishes and tear gas continued well into the night.

""This is going to continue,"" Hun said of the ongoing protests. ""There is a lot of outrage. There is a lot of inequality in this country.""",Chile opposition files 'constitutional accusation' against Pinera,politics,fundamental rights,587

All horse racing in Britain will be postponed until Wednesday February 13 at the earliest after the outbreak in a huge blow for the sport.

Racing across the country was abandoned on Thursday morning after three horses at Donald McCain’s yard in Cheshire tested positive for the virus.

Racing in Ireland continued but British horses were banned from competing.

A spokesman for Betfair has warned the impact of cancellations could be very costly for stakeholders. He said if the cancellations extend beyond Wednesday, the costs could run into tens of millions.

The spokesman for the betting website said: “‘While the projected hiatus of racing until Wednesday will have a detrimental effect on the industry, it would not be profound but a prolonged period of cancellations would obviously have a negative impact on all stakeholders, the cost of which could run into the tens of millions’’

The BHA says it will take a decision next Monday as to whether racing can resume on Wednesday.

This decision, however, will mean this weekend’s Betfair Super Saturday meet at Newbury, which includes two Grade 2 races and the £155,000 Betafir Hurdle, will not take place.

Thursday's fixtures at Huntingdon, Doncaster, Ffos and Chelsford City have also all been cancelled.

There are fears the eagerly anticipated Cheltenham Festival, which is due to take place on March 12, could be cancelled because of the outbreak.

The racing event, one of the most looked forward to events of the year, is due to take place across four days and attracts scores of visitors.

The British Horseracing Authority said: ""This precautionary approach is intended to ensure we put the health of the horse population and control of the virus first, and avoid any unnecessary risk that might come from returning to racing too quickly.

""We appreciate the impact that this may have on the sport commercially, but disease control in order to mitigate the risk of further disruption to the sport -- and safeguard the health and welfare of our horses -- must be a priority.""",Equine flu outbreak 2019: Horse racing cancellations could cost stakeholders millions if it lasts longer than a week,health,non-human diseases,344

In December 2011, after police in Springfield, Mass., had arrested Renaldo Penate for allegedly selling heroin, the drugs from that case were tested at a state drug lab by technician Sonja Farak. The same day that she did the tests, Farak wrote in a diary that she “tried to resist using [drugs] @ work but ended up failing.”

About two weeks later, Farak subsequently acknowledged, she spent the morning smoking crack in various bathrooms of her lab building, while also testing Penate’s drugs a second time. That same day, she found that police had submitted tablets of LSD. She took it, and “the sensation of colors in the wind left her unable to function for work,” court records show. Her actions would be discovered a year later, and Farak admitted she had been stealing and using drugs from the lab since 2004.

But when Penate’s lawyers asked for any information about Farak’s drug use during the time she was working in the lab, prosecutors with the Massachusetts attorney general’s office repeatedly refused to provide it. And so Penate was convicted and spent more than 5½ years in prison. A judge who investigated in 2016 called the prosecutors’ actions “intentional, repeated, prolonged and deceptive withholding of evidence from the defendants” and wrote that one of the prosecutors had a “lack of a moral compass.”","FLASHBACK:  Prosecutors who covered up Mass. drug lab scandal now face bar discipline, civil rights …",science and technology,scientific standards,236

The agency has issued a yellow weather warning for wind from 12noon on Friday to 6pm Saturday.

Expect a windy start to the day on Thursday with outbreaks of rain in places, with winds easing in the afternoon with sunny spells and perhaps the odd shower.

Largely dry at first this evening before cloud and outbreaks of rain arrive overnight, turning very windy with outbreaks of heavy rain.

Rain should ease later in the afternoon on Friday but it will stay windy with sunshine and blustery showers.

Windy again on Saturday with sunny spells and scattered showers.

The alert from the Met Office reads: ""A spell of very strong winds is expected to affect large parts of the UK leading to some travel disruption.""

""Expect some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport.

""Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likely.

""Some short term loss of power and other services is possible

""It’s possible that some coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities could be affected by spray and/or large waves.""

A deep area of low pressure is expected to track across northern Britain later on Friday and through early Saturday.

Gales will become widespread later on Friday, persisting well into Saturday whilst becoming more westerly.

Whilst some places may miss the worst of the winds, inland gusts of 50 mph are expected quite widely, with some places having gusts in excess of 60 mph, more especially across the north of the warning area on Saturday.

Gusts of up to 70 mph are likely around some coasts exposed to the west or southwest.

Winds will gradually ease on Saturday, with the strongest winds becoming confined to Scotland on Saturday afternoon.

These winds will lead to large waves affecting coasts and the possibility of waves overtopping some coastal routes, especially in the west and south of the warning area.

In addition, bands of heavy rain sweeping eastwards on Friday in particular will present an additional hazard.

Gusts approaching 80mph have hit England and Wales with weather warnings for further strong winds set to come into force for the weekend.

A yellow warning for wind has been issued by the Met Office for most of the UK on Friday and Saturday, meaning delays are likely to road, rail, air and ferry travel.

Tall vehicles travelling on exposed roads and bridges should also expect to be delayed by the weather, according to forecasters.

Met Office meteorologist Mark Wilson said: ""Through Friday and Saturday there are going to be some more strong winds and heavy rain.""

The Queen Elizabeth II Bridge at the Dartford Crossing, a major commuter route across the River Thames, was closed for around three hours on Thursday morning due to unsafe wind speeds, Highways England said.

Essex Police warned motorists to expect long delays on roads in the area.

A 76mph gust was measured on Thursday morning in Capel Curig, north Wales, as well as a 67mph gust in Aberdaron on the country's west coast.

In the south east of England, 54mph winds were measured in Langdon Bay in Kent and gusts of 52mph in Thorney Island, West Sussex.

The strongest wind measured by the Met Office overnight was 79mph on the Isle of Wight.

Winds are expected to ease off later on Thursday ahead of the blustery weekend.

Mr Wilson said on Thursday: ""There is going to be a wet and windy feel this morning but through the rest of the day winds will ease a little bit.

""There will be a mixture of sunshine and showers, with the showers mainly in the west.""

64393,birminghammail,"Consultation over No Outsiders equality lessons at Parkfield School was 'a shambles', disappointed parent representatives said today.

The school, in the heart of Alum Rock, has announced it intends to reinstate the equality lessons when school resumes in September.

The programme has been amended to be more sensitive to religious concerns and will be renamed as 'No Outsiders in a Faith Community.'

But the announcement has infuriated Parkfield Parents Group, which has been in consultation with the school for more than four months.

""We are hoping we can still put a stop to this for the sake of community harmony,"" said Javed Iqbal, a grandfather of two pupils and representative of Alum Rock Community Forum.

""These talks should have been an example to the rest of the country that consultation is better than protest - that peaceful discussion can lead to compromise.

""We do not want anyone to start protesting again at the school gates. I don't believe in having megaphones and protests outside a primary school.

""We managed to calm things down and get everyone around the table, but now parents feel they have been sold out,"" he said.

The school faced weeks of protests at the gates earlier this year.

Anger erupted when mum Fatimah Shah petitioned to stop No Outsiders - a programme evolved around the Equality Act that includes storybooks about LGBT and same-sex marriages - back in January.

The programme was the brainchild of the school's assistant head Andrew Moffatt and is being used in schools across the country.

Campaign trucks, heated speeches, posters and hundreds of picketing protesters rallied to bring the programme to a halt.

The situation calmed when the school suspended the programme to begin talks with parents and community representatives.

Parents and campaigners were persuaded to back off in the belief that through consultation there would be give and take, leading to a greater acceptance on both sides, said Mr Iqbal.

""We don't feel that has been done here - the school have conceded very little. Parents feel let down,"" he said.

""They expected we could negotiate some compromise. We did not expect to get everything to their liking, but for there to be give and take.

""This could all have been settled and a model for the rest of the country if the school had been willing to compromise over its use of No Outsiders but it was not.""

The key issue for some parents is the continued use of the No Outsiders programme, in preference to other equality programmes used by schools elsewhere.

They say No Outsiders has a too heavy emphasis on LGBT equality and links to the controversial Prevent agenda.

""There are many other equality programmes used in schools but the school was adamant they would stick with this programme,"" added Mr Iqbal.

""The parents believe in equality, no ifs and buts about that, but this programme in particular has been a huge issue for parents.""

Mr Iqbal, whose grown up children all attended the school, added: ""The community feel demonised for being Muslim and for their faith.""

The parent group is now continuing to press the school to think again to try to avoid stirring up renewed conflict in the community.

A final meeting of the consultation group is due to take place today (July 4), while representations are continuing to be made direct to Education Secretary Damian Hinds and Regional Schools Commissioner Andrew Warren.

The talks had been 'peaceful and professionally conducted' and parents had maintained their media silence throughout, as promised, added Mr Iqbal.

""We were very clear that protest was not the answer, and we pressed parents and the school to consult. We got people around the table and listening to each other.

""I do not agree with protest at the school gates and using megaphones - all I want is for people to live peacefully.""

In a tweet he described the outcome of the consultation as ""Consultation failure of the highest order. A shambles.""

A fellow representative, Wajid Hussain, went further: ""No #mediation No#consultation Yes#dictatorship""

The programme was developed by Mr Moffatt, who was awarded an MBE for his work in equality education. It is taught by schools across the country, the ethos being to promote LGBT equality and challenge homophobia in primary schools.

The school was told the No Outsiders books and lessons were age appropriate during a spot check by Ofsted earlier this year. It praised Parkfield’s record on promoting “tolerance, acceptance and mutual respect”, and confirmed its rating of “outstanding”.

Fatima Shah, who first raised the issue and pulled her daughter out of the school, saying children were too young to be learning about same-sex marriages and LGBT issues in class, also said the concerned parents had not been listened to.

""'The school has said it will do exactly the same as it was doing before but with a slightly different name. How is that taking our views into account?” she said.

In a statement, the school said: ""As a result of the consultation 'No Outsiders for a Faith Community' has been especially designed for Parkfield Community School acknowledging and respecting the concerns and sensitivity expressed by some parents in the present school community.""

The resources and programme will also be structured for each year group.

""Our school ethos of equality and everyone being welcome remains a key aspect of our school,"" the school statement added.

The programme's creator Mr Moffatt has said its aim was to introduce children to diversity in society and make them accept difference within the world today so that 'everybody is welcome'.

Last week we learned the school's headteacher, David Williams, was leaving to become a senior headteacher at another school managed by the trust which runs Parkfield.

The recent demonstrations spread to Anderton Park School in Sparkhill, which does not use the No Outsiders programme.

The school recently won a high court injunction banning protests in the streets around the school. A full trial to consider the injunction is to take place between July 22 and 31.",Parents blast Parkfield School for 'shambles' consultation into No Outsiders lessons,education,parent organisation,965

Councillors voted almost unanimously in favour of a motion, which binds the authority to Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham’s green ambitions for the conurbation.

In an impassioned speech, Lib Dem leader Coun Andy Kelly called on colleagues to recognise the urgency of the situation.

Presenting his motion, he said: “Climate change is real, whether we like it or not.

“We are in a state of emergency - sea levels are rising, temperatures are rising across the globe, pollution is the highest it has ever been.”

He added that while climate change may be a global issue, its effects were already being felt much closer to home.

“It affects us locally with air quality, with the flooding issues we see time and again in this borough and it’s certainly going to affect our children and grandchildren - and those children not yet born,” he said.

“For future generations, if we don’t do something about this now, we are poisoning future generations and shortening their lives.”

The Lib Dem chief said that by declaring a climate emergency the council would give itself a platform to develop green policies.

“Declaring a climate change emergency gives us a chance to promote the elimination of single use plastics, to invest in a better transport system, to reinvest in planting trees, improving air quality, biodiversity and improving the natural heritage of the borough,"" he added.

“Every new house we can ensure is of the greenest standard, some very practical things we can get behind as a council; ensuring every new house has electric car points.

“All these things we can do, not just to reduce pollution but ensure a long term sustainability for the borough.”

In a final rallying call, he added: “Councillors, it’s not too late to change things with climate change, but it’s getting very, very late in the day.”

Labour, whose amendment set the target date at 2038 for both the borough and council achieving carbon neutrality, backed the motion.

Coun Wendy Cocks said: “We owe it to our citizens who may suffer from extreme weather, food shortages and other climate related dangers. And owe it to our young people who are concerned about their future.”

Warning that ‘the clock is ticking’ she added: “We have perhaps 10 or 12 years, our own experience, with the Boxing Day floods and other events will continue to be more frequent without action. We in Rochdale must move quickly for the benefit of all the community, our children’s future and the survival of the whole planet.”

Tory leader Coun Ashley Dearnley said his party was ‘absolutely committed to ensure that this time, for the first time our generation will leave a better planet for the next generation to come and to safeguard for the future’.

He also said the motion’s call to set up a working group to tackle the issue was ‘really important’ and called for every council report to be made relevant to the issue of climate change.

“At times when it’s been necessary to do that, this council has always done the right thing to ensure that we improve how the council works to the benefit of everyone that lives here,"" he said.

There is no single definition but it involves the recognition that urgent action is needed if global warming is to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C.

A UN report warns that the risk of catastrophic climate change -  including extreme heat, drought and flooding - would significantly increase if temperatures rise beyond this point.

It says we could have just 11 years left to limit a climate change catastrophe.

The UK government declared a climate change emergency in May - a move Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described as ‘a huge step forward’

It was one of the key demands of campaign group Extinction Rebellion - however, it does not compel the government to take any specific action.

Scotland declared a climate emergency in April - and targets are being set to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2045.

The idea of a local area declaring a climate emergency was first put forward by Bristol councillor Carla Denyer and the motion was passed by the city council in November.

Since then dozens of authorities across the country have declared a climate emergency - with many setting a target of being carbon neutral by 2030.

29772,bbc,"As Christian churches throughout the US face widespread decline, one church is bucking the trend. But is Hillsong a triumph of marketing or faith?

If someone were to choreograph an ideal concert audience, it would look something like this.

Everyone has their hands up and everyone is swaying. The opening bars of each song are met with a roar of frenzied recognition. For the few who don't already know them by heart, the lyrics beam down from massive screens flanking the stage.

The songs sound expertly engineered to elicit an emotional reaction. The melodies rise, fall, then rise again like a more dramatic version of Mumford and Sons. The band, Hillsong United, had sold out the Anthem, among Washington's favourite venues.

The collective style of the 10 members on stage is mirrored by their audience: skinny jeans, over-sized T-shirts and tattoos. This uniformity makes the fans look less like a crowd and more like a congregation.

There are a few hints that the members of Hillsong are not your average rockstars, different to a musician like Billie Eilish, who took the same stage just days before.

First, there is no alcohol being sold anywhere in the venue. Any related branding has been hidden. Second, there are volunteers in blue vests slowly circling the concert floor, seeking donations for a Christian ministry group. And third, there is a massive CGI recreation of Jesus Christ on the cross, beamed up above the stage.

This isn't just a concert, this is church.

The band, Hillsong United, is a vital limb of Hillsong Church. Founded by husband and wife duo Brian and Bobbie Houston in Sydney, Australia, in 1983, the ministry has expanded into a global Evangelical phenomenon.

It spans six continents and claims churches in 23 cities. Every Sunday, an average of 130,000 worshippers will attend a Hillsong service somewhere around the world.

Hillsong's congregation now boasts a celebrity following: Justin Bieber and his wife, Hailey Baldwin Bieber, are famed members. NBA players Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving have been known to seek guidance from Hillsong New York's head pastor, Carl Lentz. Chris Pratt, Kylie Jenner and Kourtney Kardashian have also been tied to the church.

""They are one massively impactful ministry right now,"" says Mack Brock, who opened for Hillsong during its North American tour this year, after more than a decade as a worship leader at Elevation, a megachurch based in North Carolina.

Hillsong calls itself a ""contemporary"" Christian church, ""on a mission to see God's kingdom established across the earth"". This mission is being manifested in its ministry and its sprawling brand. Hillsong lays claim to two colleges (one in Sydney and one in Phoenix, Arizona), annual conferences, a 24-hour TV channel, community service initiatives and a music label.

Of these, Hillsong United is arguably the most visible and, certainly, the most accessible to the mainstream.

The band has more than 2 million followers on Instagram, with an additional 1.5 million combined from its 10 members. Their songs have almost 3.5 million weekly listens on Spotify. Their followers nearly double that of the platform's Top Christian channel.

Its most popular song to date, Oceans, has been played more than 155 million times on Spotify alone. For context, that is more than twice the plays than Billie Eilish's recent collaboration with Justin Bieber.

The tie between Christianity and rock music is not new, but the expanse of Hillsong's reach may be. The North America leg of its People tour included stops in more than 30 cities in the US and Canada. In November, they will take on Latin America, covering Brazil, Argentina and Peru.

Hillsong is ""on the forefront of church music"" Brock says. ""They're the ones that I think do it best.""

The meteoric rise of Hillsong, in all its various forms, is particularly striking given persistent declines in religiosity worldwide. For years, the Christian share of the US population has fallen, paralleled by an increase in those who do not identify with any religion at all.

Over a period of seven years - 2007 to 2014 - the percentage of adults who describe themselves as Christian dropped by almost eight percentage points. This drop is most pronounced among young people, a demographic that is especially enthralled by Hillsong.

At the Anthem, the line to enter formed about an hour before the doors to the venue opened, more than two before anyone started singing.

""We've waited our whole lives to see them"" says Danielle Caputo, 27, as she waited to see the band in July. ""On earth, it's the easiest way to see God's love in person."" Her friend, Kristin Maghamez adds: ""Hillsong concerts are a place where you can truly worship.""

Most of the people I spoke to answered with some version of this: Hillsong's music is an embodiment of their faith, and their concerts are a chance to share in it with others. ""You feel like sometimes there's nobody with our views,"" Maghamez says. ""[Christianity] is almost looked down upon.""

Many intimated a visceral connection to Hillsong or, as Caputo put it: ""I'm going to cry my eyes out."" And there were plenty of tears, especially when Hillsong, the band, leaned more toward Hillsong, the church.

""God's been doing something,"" says lead singer Joel Houston - son of Bobbie and Brian - to the crowd, resting his hands on his guitar. ""I believe there's not one person here by accident."" ""I believe God is going to meet you where you're at.""

This notion - of meeting followers where they are - is central to Hillsong's mission, and to its appeal.

Hillsong is located squarely in the thoroughfare of the young and hip. Hillsong's band sells out arenas, its church services fill Manhattan's Hammerstein Ballroom, its pastors sit courtside at NBA games.

Brock and other followers interviewed reject the idea that Hillsong's designer aesthetic is either a deliberate choice on the part of its leaders, or a calculated marketing scheme. But to an outsider, Hillsong's initial appeal lies in the visuals. Its brand looks and feels like your cool friend on Instagram.

""They're relevant,"" says Joe Adevai, who attended Hillsong College in Sydney before becoming a worship leader in New Jersey. ""They're keeping up with the culture,"" he said. ""How do you stay cool and be a Christian?""

Whatever the packaging, Hillsong is, fundamentally, a religious institution. More specifically, it is an Evangelical church, one that sees the Bible as ""accurate, authoritative, and applicable to our everyday lives"".

To some, this presents an inherent contradiction: a church marketed widely, with contemporary branding, that remains decidedly conservative.

Josh Canfield knows this tension intimately. He first joined Hillsong in 2008, soon becoming a vocalist on their worship team. Compared to the church of his youth, Hillsong seemed ""edgy"".

When Canfield, who is gay, joined Hillsong, he was still grappling with his sexuality in the context of his faith. While his parents' church was explicit in its stance - homosexuality is a sin - Hillsong was less transparent.

""It did feel like a ""don't ask don't tell"" kind of situation,"" Canfield says. ""No one is going to ask, because no one wants to ask.""

Sermons were resolutely positive, Canfield tells me, calling upon congregants to love the marginalised, immigrants and the poor. ""But it does seem like they just forget about the LGBTQ group,"" he says.

In 2014, Canfield appeared on the reality show Survivor, speaking openly about his sexuality and his role at Hillsong. Canfield had told leadership at Hillsong New York of his plans, who ""gave the go-ahead"".

But after episodes began to air and Canfield's storyline gained media attention, head pastor Brian Houston publicly ""clarified"" Hillsong's stance on homosexuality.

In a blog post on Hillsong's website called Do I Love Gay People, Houston wrote that ""God's word is clear"" on homosexuality.

""Hillsong Church welcomes ALL people but does not affirm all lifestyles,"" he said. ""Put clearly, we do not affirm a gay lifestyle and because of this we do not knowingly have actively gay people in positions of leadership, either paid or unpaid.""

Canfield was asked to step down from his position with the vocalist team. After a series of private meetings with New York's head pastor, Carl Lentz, Canfield decided to leave the church.

""My problem is not that Hillsong believes that homosexuality is a sin, that is their prerogative to have that belief,"" he says. ""But the problem is they're not being completely open about their beliefs because they don't want those people to leave… is that lying? In religious terms, is that a sin of omission?""

The semantic two-step in Houston's statement is a common refrain among Hillsong congregants: the church welcomes all people, but does not condone all ""lifestyles"". They prefer to talk about what they are for rather than what they are against, turning to some version of ""love the sinner, not the sin"".

""I think the Bible calls it out as a sin,"" Caputo says to me of gay marriage, a few weeks after the concert. ""I don't think it's wrong to say that, but it needs to follow up with: God will love you anyway.""

Steven Paulikas, a priest at All Saints Episcopal Church in Brooklyn and a doctoral student at Oxford's school of theology, argues there is a cost to this type of nuance.

""If a church says that it's welcoming in one part of its way of being, but explicitly says it's not welcoming in another place - those things are irreconcilable,"" he says. ""And one thing trumps the other.""

Paulikas did not comment specifically on Hillsong, but spoke about churches in general that include all people, but not all parts of them.

""That form of bait and switch is a type of spiritual violence,"" Paulikas says. ""As a queer person… it's profoundly disturbing.""

On the surface, Paulikas' steepled church lacks some of the star power claimed by Hillsong. And though he says that his own congregation has grown in recent years, he acknowledges the institutional slide hurting others like it.

""We see our numbers declining and it is very distressing,"" he says. Looking at churches like Hillsong, ""there are feelings of envy because our institutions are by and large losing people"".

Paulikas and his colleagues talk about ways to expand their circles of faith - something Hillsong has mastered - ""to an obsessive extent"". But he objects to the ""success"" of a church being measured in relation to its fan following. The shine associated with Hillsong is of no interest to him.

""I see that as a distraction,"" he says. ""Is that Evangelism or is that marketing?""

Moral teaching is strongest when it is removed from earthly markers of success like wealth and popularity, he continued.

After leaving Hillsong, Canfield has turned to a smaller congregation, one without the celebrity of Hillsong.

""When the cameras aren't there, and no one is interviewing you, that's where most true Christianity resides,"" he says.

But he is still defensive of his former church.

""You walk into Hillsong and it's cool and it's dark and there are lights going and there are all these people around you who are your age who are smiling and talking,"" Canfield says. ""And then the music starts and it washes over you… the noise of outside gets cancelled out.""

""The music is so beautiful and uplifting and it makes you feel better,"" he continued. ""I don't think there's anything in the Bible that says we can't feel good.""",Hillsong: A church with rock concerts and 2m followers,religion and belief,religious institutions and state relations,1855

New techniques, from non-surgical liposuction to nose contouring, pain-free facelifts and even an alternative to traditional high-risk gastric band surgery, mean less plastic surgery procedures are being carried out.

Glasgow Botox and filler practitioner Dr Darren McKeown said traditional operations are being superseded by less invasive options.

He added: “There has been a perception that non-surgical treatments must mean inferior results. We’re now reaching the point where non-surgical can reach some of the results of surgical procedures and, in some cases, be better. They do that without any of the risks or side-effects.”

New procedures are becoming so popular so fast because none of them require an anaesthetic or a stay in hospital. And they have none of the risks and complications associated with traditional plastic surgery.

Darren’s clinic is offering CoolSculpting as an alternative to liposuction. The results, he said, speak for themselves.

He added: “I can say that, having had liposuction myself, complications don’t happen that often, but the recovery process is pretty traumatic.

“It’s painful, you are in compression garments for six weeks. No matter how expert the surgeon, there’s always a wee bump there, a wee dent there.

“This costs about the same, so it’s not cheap but do it properly and by god does it work.

“We technically still offer liposuction but we are thinking about stopping. Why offer an invasive procedure when there is a non-invasive alternative?

“Liposuction is still considered the gold standard in spot fat reduction treatment but in the next 10-15 years, no one will be doing it.”

CoolSculpting works by freezing the fat cells in problem areas under the skin. Once they have been destroyed, they are gradually broken down and processed by the liver.

Darren is hosting a CoolSculpting event at Glasgow’s Princes Square from July 10-24 to show people how it works.

The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons report that liposuction has fallen by 46 per cent in the last four years.

Surgical facelifts have gone down 67 per cent and nose jobs by 44 per cent.

Darren is also at the forefront of facelifts using fillers and nose and chin contouring.

He said: “Fillers get a really bad name. People think of fillers as big, fat, puffy faces. That’s just not the way it should look.

“As the face ages, it does lose fat and needs to plump up. But the more profound changes are at the level of the bone. The skeleton is shrinking, the jaw and cheekbones are getting smaller, the eye sockets are getting bigger, there’s less bone around them.

“These fillers will need to be topped up every two years or so. But over 10 years – the life span of a facelift – the cost is about the same.”

Darren also uses fillers to reshape the nose. And there is a new injectable chin implant that has replaced a major operation on the jaw or a silicone chin implant.

Sam Robson, another aesthetic doctor, is pioneering a weightloss treatment that is getting as good results as gastric band and bariatric surgery.

The five-step programme is led by a team of professional therapists, nutritionists, psychologists and personal trainers at her Temple Clinic in Aberdeen.

The former GP said: “For some people, surgery will always be an option. But for a lot of others, we are getting just as good results.

“This is something I am incredibly passionate about. Many of the patients I used to see in my practice had health conditions related to their weight. Often, they asked me about surgery to control their eating.

“Gastric band or stomach sleeve surgery is not always the right option. Like all surgical procedures, there are risks and with these operations, it means that the way you eat and what you can eat is changed forever.”",Top Glasgow cosmetics doc shares incredible before and after pics of non-surgical procedures,health,medical profession,628

Just two days after delivering a similar message about their on-field activities with the appointment of three-time Champions League winner Carlo Ancelotti as their new manager, off the pitch things are moving forward.

Following lengthy public consultation – which includes tweaking the proposals to integrate a multi-storey car park from the waterside into the stadium design and introducing additional environmental measures, including wind baffles – an application will be sent to Liverpool City Council later.

“This is a huge milestone in the club’s history but also a profound statement of intent for our future,” said Baxendale-Barrett.

“It marks the culmination of many years of work that has combined the passion of our fans with world-class design and a commitment to creating something truly special on Liverpool’s waterfront.

“The stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock will deliver the best possible matchday experience for our fans, new facilities for cultural events and a building that will be a stunning new addition to Liverpool’s built environment.

“If we are granted planning approval, this will be a world-class football stadium in a world-class location and a catalyst for Liverpool City Region’s ongoing growth and success.

“We’ve always believed that this project can be a game-changer for North Liverpool...(it) isn’t just about a new football ground – it’s about regeneration, jobs and social value.”

27237,bbc,"A Hindu veterinary doctor in south-east Pakistan has been charged under the country's strict blasphemy laws after allegedly selling medicine wrapped in paper bearing Islamic religious text.

An angry crowd set fire to his clinic near Mirpur Khas, Sindh province, and other Hindu-owned shops were looted.

The vet said his use of the paper, apparently torn from an Islamic studies school textbook, was a mistake.

If he is convicted he could be sentenced to life in prison.

Pakistan's blasphemy laws carry harsh penalties for anyone who insults Islam. Critics say they target a disproportionate number of people from religious minorities.

According to reports, the vet had used pages from the school textbook to wrap up medicines for a customer with sick livestock. But the customer saw Islamic religious content on the pages and went to a local cleric who informed police.

Maulana Hafeez-ur-Rehman, a local leader of the religious political party Jamiat Ulema-e-Islami, told BBC Urdu that the doctor had done it deliberately.

According to police, the vet has insisted that his use of the paper was a mistake.

He has since been charged with insulting religious beliefs and defiling the Koran and faces life in prison.

Four shops, including the vet's clinic and a medical store, were ransacked and then set alight, local journalists reported.

Mirpur Khas police officer Javed Iqbal told the BBC that those involved in the attacks would be arrested. He said they had ""neither love for Islam nor for their neighbours"".

Islam is Pakistan's national religion and public support for the strict blasphemy laws is strong.

Correspondents say hardline politicians have often backed severe punishments, partly as a way of shoring up their support base.

Hundreds of Pakistani citizens have been charged with blasphemy over the past few decades and some cases have triggered an international outcry.

The Ventura County Fire Department posted on Facebook Tuesday that their firefighters were “working extra shifts” to keep communities safe and that when they were not working, several firefighters visited a little girl on her birthday while her father was working to contain the Getty Fire:

“The fire family is so amazing how we come together to support each other,” the department said in the post.

Fire officials report the Getty Fire is 27 percent contained as of Wednesday and is one out of ten different wildfires burning throughout thousands of acres of land in California.

The Getty Fire began when a falling tree branch struck power lines and ignited nearby brush, fire officials said.

“The fire was likely caused by a tree branch that broke off during the high wind conditions and subsequently landed on nearby power lines, which resulted in sparking and arcing that ignited nearby brush,” the Los Angeles Fire Department said in a statement.

In northern California, residents are dealing with wildfires coupled with power outages as Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), the state’s largest utility, shut off power to many areas to prevent wildfires.

The Ministry pointed out that Trump's statement ""confirms the US’s blind commitment to Israel and support for its aggressive behaviour"".

""It became clear to the international community that the United States and their reckless policies, which are dominated by arrogance and hegemonic ambitions, are a major factor in exacerbating the situation in the global arena and threaten peace and stability,"" the Ministry underscored.

It also noted that the US clearly violates international law and a number of UN resolutions, in particular, Resolution 497, in which Israel’s intentions to establish its laws in the Golan Heights are considered invalid and illegal.

Iran has also criticised what it described as Trump’s “illegal” and “unacceptable” remarks on the Golan Heights.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stated that Moscow’s position on the matter remains unchanged and that “changing the status of the Golan Heights by bypassing the Security Council is a direct violation of UN decisions”.

The statement comes after Trump tweeted on Thursday that “after 52 years it is time for the United States to fully recognise Israel's Sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which is of critical strategic and security importance to the State of Israel and regional stability.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for his part, thanked Trump for “boldly” recognising Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights ""at a time when Iran seeks to use Syria as a platform to destroy Israel"". US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in turn, claimed during his visit to Jerusalem on Thursday that President Trump had been sent by God to Earth in order to save Israel.

A strategic area covering some 1,200 square kilometres, the Golan Heights were occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. Netanyahu has repeatedly underlined that the Jewish state would not meet Syria's demands that it retreat to the 1967 lines because they were “indefensible”, and that the Golan Heights would “remain in the hands of Israel forever”.","Syria 'Determined' to Recover Israeli-Occupied Golan Heights, Lambasts Trump","conflict, war and peace",post-war reconstruction,311

1106989,westernjournal,"A family’s heirloom Bible has remained intact after a massive shed fire on Christmas Eve in Socastee, South Carolina.

Louis McGowan had been celebrating Christmas Eve with his family when, around 11:00 p.m., he saw flames running up the side of his shed on his security camera.

McGowan told WPDE that he raced outside to see if he could tame the blaze, but the fire began to rage too fast.

Within 10 minutes, firefighters from Horry County Fire Rescue responded to the home and stopped the blaze, but the shed and its contents were utterly destroyed.

“A lot of things in here is like unrecognizable for the most part,” McGowan told WPDE. “It’s just destroyed.”

As McGowan watched the shed go up in flames, he took a mental inventory of what had been inside, which included two sentimental family heirlooms: an American flag from his great grandfather’s burial and a Bible that had belonged to McGowan’s father.

When McGowan walked through the charred remnants of his shed the following day, he tried to decipher objects that had melted into unrecognizable lumps.

He was able to locate both the flag and the Bible, which had been sitting on a shelf in the shed. The flag was mostly burned and blackened, with some sections of fabric intact.

But when McGowan opened up his father’s Bible, he found the pages unscathed, readable, and entirely intact. The cover was blackened and the book’s edges a bit burned, but the scriptures inside were untouched.

“There isn’t a thing in here you can’t read. Everything is 100 percent readable,” McGowan said. “There’s some of dad’s favorite psalms.”

As McGowan flipped through the pages, he was able to look on Biblical passages his father had highlighted years ago.

On the eve of one of the most important dates in the Christian faith, the Bible was able to withstand the fire.

“I just think it’s amazing that the Bible stayed intact,” McGowan said.

Overall, McGowan has remained optimistic about the fire that leveled his shed to the ground, thankful that his family was unharmed.

“Everybody is fine. All of this can be replaced,” he said.

Massachusetts State Police is the first law enforcement agency in the country to use Boston Dynamics' dog-like robot, called Spot. While the use of robotic technology is not new for state police, the temporary acquisition of Spot — a customizable robot some have called “terrifying” — is raising questions from civil rights advocates about how much oversight there should be over police robotics programs.

The state’s bomb squad had Spot on loan from the Waltham-based Boston Dynamics for three months starting in August until November, according to records obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts and reviewed by WBUR.

The documents do not reveal a lot of details on the robot dog’s exact use, but a state police spokesman said Spot, like the department’s other robots, was used as a “mobile remote observation device” to provide troopers with images of suspicious devices or potentially hazardous locations, like where an armed suspect might be hiding.

“Robot technology is a valuable tool for law enforcement because of its ability to provide situational awareness of potentially dangerous environments,” state police spokesman David Procopio wrote.

State police say Spot was used in two incidents, in addition to testing.

Boston Dynamics vice president for business development Michael Perry said the company wants Spot to have lots of different uses, in industries ranging from oil and gas companies, to construction, to entertainment. He envisions police sending Spot into areas that are too hazardous for a human — a chemical spill, or near a suspected bomb, or into a hostage situation.

“Right now, our primary interest is sending the robot into situations where you want to collect information in an environment where it's too dangerous to send a person, but not actually physically interacting with the space,” Perry said.

Spot is a “general purpose” robot, with an open API. That means customers — whether a police department or warehouse operator — can customize Spot with its own software. (State police say they didn't use this feature.) It has a 360-degree, low-light camera, and an arm.

For all of its potential, Boston Dynamics doesn’t want Spot weaponized. Perry said the lease agreements have a clause requiring the robot not be used in a way that would “physically harm or intimidate people.”

“Part of our early evaluation process with customers is making sure that we're on the same page for the usage of the robot,” he said. “So upfront, we're very clear with our customers that we don't want the robot being used in a way that can physically harm somebody.”

That’s one of the reasons why the company is opting for lease agreements, rather than a sale, Perry said. Boston Dynamics wants to be selective in which companies get access to Spot — and have the ability to take the equipment back if the lease is violated.

Through Procopio, state police said the department never weaponized any of its robots, including Spot.

But while Spot and other tactical robots aren’t designed to kill, they still can. In 2016, Dallas Police sent a bomb disposal robot armed with explosives to kill a sniper who had shot at police officers and killed five. Experts said it was the first time a non-military robot had been used to intentionally kill a person.

That deadly potential, and lack of transparency about the state police’s overall robotics program, worries Kade Crockford, director of the technology for liberty program at the ACLU of Massachusetts. Crockford said they want to see a policy from state police about its use of robotics and a conversation about how and when robots should be used. State police didn’t say whether there’s a current policy about the use of robots, and the ACLU’s records request to the agency didn’t turn one up.

“We just really don't know enough about how the state police are using this,” Crockford said. “And the technology that can be used in concert with a robotic system like this is almost limitless in terms of what kinds of surveillance and potentially even weaponization operations may be allowed.”",First robot police dog unleashed...,"crime, law and justice",law enforcement,679
29905,bbc,"Brazil's Amazon rainforest has seen a record number of fires this year, new space agency data suggests.

The National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) said its satellite data showed an 84% increase on the same period in 2018.

It comes weeks after President Jair Bolsonaro sacked the head of the agency amid rows over its deforestation data.

The largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming.

It is also home to about three million species of plants and animals, and one million indigenous people.

Conservationists have blamed Mr Bolsonaro for the Amazon's plight, saying he has encouraged loggers and farmers to clear the land, and scientists say the rainforest has suffered losses at an accelerated rate since he took office in January.

Meanwhile, US space agency Nasa said that overall fire activity in the Amazon basin was slightly below average this year.

The agency said that while activity had increased in Amazonas and Rondonia, it had decreased in the states of Mato Grosso and Pará.

It was earlier reported that a blackout on Monday in the city of São Paulo - more than 2,700km (1,700 miles) away - had been caused by smoke from the Amazon fires.

But some meteorologists say the smoke came from major fires burning in Paraguay, which is much closer to the city and not in the Amazon region.

Wildfires often occur in the dry season in Brazil but they are also deliberately started in efforts to illegally deforest land for cattle ranching.

Inpe said it had detected more than 74,000 fires between January and August - the highest number since records began in 2013. It said it had observed more than 9,500 forest fires since Thursday, mostly in the Amazon region.

In comparison, there are slightly more than 40,000 in the same period of 2018, it said. However, the worst recent year was 2016, with more than 68,000 fires in that period.

The satellite images showed Brazil's most northern state, Roraima, covered in dark smoke, while neighbouring Amazonas declared an emergency over the fires.

Mr Bolsonaro brushed off the latest data, saying it was the ""season of the queimada"", when farmers use fire to clear land. ""I used to be called Captain Chainsaw. Now I am Nero, setting the Amazon aflame,"" he was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.

Later he appeared to suggest that non-governmental organisations had set fires, as revenge for his government slashing their funding. He presented no evidence and gave no names to support this theory, saying there were ""no written records about the suspicions"".

""So, there could be..., I'm not affirming it, criminal action by these 'NGOers' to call attention against my person, against the government of Brazil. This is the war that we are facing,"" he said in a Facebook Live on Wednesday.

Inpe noted that the number of fires was not in line with those normally reported during the dry season.

""There is nothing abnormal about the climate this year or the rainfall in the Amazon region, which is just a little below average,"" Inpe researcher Alberto Setzer told Reuters.

""The dry season creates the favourable conditions for the use and spread of fire, but starting a fire is the work of humans, either deliberately or by accident.""

Ricardo Mello, head of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Amazon Programme, said the fires were ""a consequence of the increase in deforestation seen in recent figures"".

The reports of a rise in forest fires come amid criticism over Mr Bolsonaro's environmental policies. Scientists say the Amazon has suffered losses at an accelerated rate since the president took office in January, with policies favouring development over conservation.

Over the past decade, previous governments had managed to reduce deforestation with action by federal agencies and a system of fines. But Mr Bolsonaro and his ministers have criticised the penalties and overseen a fall in confiscations of timber and convictions for environmental crimes.

Last month, the far-right president accused Inpe's director of lying about the scale of deforestation in the Amazon and trying to undermine the government. It came after Inpe published data showing an 88% increase in deforestation there in June compared to the same month a year ago.

The director of the agency later announced that he was being sacked amid the row.

Inpe has previously insisted that its data is 95% accurate. The agency's reliability has also been defended by several scientific institutions, including the Brazilian Academy of Sciences.

• The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits jumped by the most in two years last week.

• More comprehensive measures have pointed to a solid labor market in recent weeks.

The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits jumped by the most in two years last week, but the sharp increase likely reflected seasonal volatility.

The Labor Department said on Thursday that initial jobless claims rose by 49,000, to a seasonally adjusted 252,000, in the week that ended December 7. That was the highest level since September 2017 and compared with forecasts of 212,000 claims.

The rise was likely driven by the Thanksgiving holiday, which could have interfered with government estimates. In the previous week, jobless claims dropped to a seven-month low. The less volatile four-week moving average rose by 6,250, to 224,000, in early December.

""Claims are likely to remain erratic over the holiday,"" said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""It's hard to enough to adjust monthly data, but weekly data around holidays which fall on different days of the week each year are impossible to adjust reliably.""

MOSCOW, April 8. /TASS/. The Ukrainians themselves must settle the situation
in Donbass, because Moscow is not a party to the conflict in the southeast of
Ukraine, Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the media on
Monday. This is how he replied to Ukrainian presidential candidate Vladimir
Zelensky’s remark that in the event of his victory he would do his best to
achieve an effective ceasefire in Donbass as soon as possible and for that he
would directly contact the Russian leadership.

""Russian President Vladimir Putin has said more than once that for settling
the conflict in Donbass the most important thing is not dialogue with Moscow,
because Moscow is not a party to this conflict. It is an intra-Ukrainian
conflict and it is up to the Ukrainians to settle it, if they talk to each
other,"" Peskov said.

He answered in the negative to the elaborative question if that meant that
Russia would not discuss Donbass with Zelensky, should he take the reins of
power as Ukraine’s next president.

""No, it does not mean that. You know that Putin is always open for dialogue,
except for situations where the dialogue is accompanied by various
provocations and acts of sabotage. In that case, Putin’s reaction is very
clear, unequivocal and resolute. Putin has always been and still remains a
supporter of a dialogue for resolving the problems on the agenda,"" Peskov
said.

On April 7, Zelensky said in a televised interview that should he be elected,
he would do his utmost to achieve an effective truce in Donbass as soon as
possible. He called for more active contacts with the residents of the Donbass
areas beyond Kiev’s control - the self-proclaimed republics - over social
issues. In particular, he pointed to the need for paying pensions.

Asked if he was prepared to contact the Russian leadership directly, Zelensky
answered in the affirmative. Also, he declared it was necessary to keep
working within the framework of the Minsk Accords for a settlement in Donbass,
adding that in his opinion the agreements should be reformed.

 A TALE OF TWO PRISONERS: Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and right-wing personality Tommy Robinson, are being treated very differently inside HM Belmarsh Prison.

 

 Nina Cross

 21st Century Wire

Alfred de Zayas, former UN Rapporteur, has described the actions of the British authorities in pursuit of Assange as “… contrary to the rule of law and contrary to the spirit of the law.”  What we see on the surface is an illusion of British justice, masking a political agenda behind it.

Britain’s notorious Belmarsh Prison is now being presented as beacon of good governance, indicative of a fair and just society which equitable but firm with perpetrators. After carefully reviewing the case of Julian Assange though, there can be little doubt that placing the award-winning journalist in such a facility is nothing but the latest vehicle for his rendition to the US.

So far, Belmarsh has been fulfilling that state agenda.

Belmarsh as the state’s next weapon of choice

Judge Deborah Taylor sent Assange to category A Belmarsh prison for a bail-skipping offense, even though he’d demonstrated that he had good reason to skip bail.

It is difficult not to conclude that the category A assignment was done so that he would be weak and vulnerable.  In essence, Assange was sent to Belmarsh for 50 weeks for failing to turn up at a police station.  There was no ongoing court case; he had no prior offenses; there were no charges; the Swedish investigation had been dropped.  So skipping police bail was all the British government had. It should also be pointed out that Judge Taylor made a series of mistakes during the sentencing on 1st May, referring to rape charges in Sweden, which Assange corrected and which she then acknowledged were wrong.  This indicates that Judge Taylor went into court at least uninformed, set in her mind that Assange had somewhere, somehow been charged with rape. This would seem to explain some of the reasoning behind Judge Taylor’s cruel sentencing, described by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention as ‘disproportionate’ but also as furthering the arbitrary deprivation of Assange’s liberty.  What’s more, it has been pointed out how several thousand people in the UK skip bail each year and are in now way subject to such harsh punishment.

Clearly, Judge Taylor had used narratives provided by the state in order to send Assange to a category A penitentiary, even though these narratives have been thoroughly debunked.  One of the false story lines promulgated by the British state and its mainstream media adjuncts, was that Swedish authorities had dropped its sex allegations case against Assange because it ‘could not progress with it’ while he was holed-up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.  This piece of disinformation was false, shown by the fact that Swedish authorities had already carried out no less than 44 video link or in-person interviews with persons of interest and thus were more than capable of interviewing Assange too.

As for the case itself, the question has now become: what case?  Opened then shut, then opened again, then shut, then opened, and yet – Sweden’s office of Public Prosecutions still said at the time that, ‘an interview is not on the cards’.

Not surprisingly then, Swedish authorities appear to be leaving the case hanging, as they have for years.  With the Swedish courts having recently thwarted the prosecutor’s attempts to extradite him to Sweden, is the reopened case now simply a crowd control tactic?  Perhaps they have opened it for a third time because closing the books permanently on the increasingly disingenuous ‘rapist’ narrative risks attracting increased support from those members of the public (and the government) who had been previously unsure about whether Assange was entitled to any moral support.  We wait to see when the Swedish prosecutor might decide whether a ‘interview is on the cards’ after hanging the label of rapist over Assange for nearly a decade already.

And so with all the might the British establishment could muster behind a police bail skipping offence, it has Assange trapped inside Belmarsh prison.

On cue, HM Belmarsh Prison’s high security regime has so far proved crippling for Assange’s hopes of mounting a legal defence.  It is now public knowledge that government officials at Belmarsh have imposed restrictions which effectively deny Assange sufficient legal visits, deny him the ability to speak to his US lawyers, deny him access to and possession of legal documents, and deny him the basic means through which to prepare for his legal defence, namely, a laptop computer.

For those readers who may not be versed in legalese, the following points passages will demonstrate how one can measure Belmarsh’s treatment of Assange against recognised protections and guidelines, such as:

Article 6.3 of the European Convention of Human Rights, which is of particular significance for prisoners (Assange clearly qualifies a political prisoner) and states that detainees must:

“… have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of their defence…”

The Council of Europe (CoE) has produced a definition of what this means in a guide on Article 6 of the ECHR:

NOTE: During Assange’s US extradition court hearing in June, Assange himself was adamant that he had not even received the text of the US indictment against him and said that he had to have essential legal documents posted to him. His legal team also reiterated that preparation for his defense was being impeded and that access to their client was being restricted by the British government. It is difficult to argue that this strategy is not intentional.

The CoE human rights guidelines have also set out in its European Prison Rules that:

23.6    Prisoners shall have access to, or be allowed to keep in their possession, documents relating to their legal proceedings.

“A person facing criminal charges must have the time and facilities to prepare a defence. This right exists at all stages of the proceedings and encompasses the right to documents, files, and information as well as a guarantee of confidential communication with counsel.”

In May 2019, Nils Melzer, UN Rapporteur on Torture, reported that Assange had restricted access to legal documents in his cell.

More recently award-winning journalist John Pilger also reported how Assange was not permitted access to documents to prepare his defence:

In regard to Assange’s request for a laptop computer, the UK’s  Access to Justice guidelines shows this is a reasonable request and Assange’s case would seem to encapsulate the exact conditions covered by it:

“The guidance does say that laptops should be given to people who could not prepare for their case properly without it, but should not be given if it would just make things more convenient.”

The CoE’s guide on Article 6.3 also legitimises the request:

Following his assessment of Assange in May inside Belmarsh prison, Nils Melzer issued a statement detailing the conditions of dentention. Melzer was accompanied by two medical experts who specialize in the examination of possible victims of torture as well as the documentation of symptoms, both physical and psychological.  On examining Assange Melzer observed the following:

“Most importantly, in addition to physical ailments, Mr. Assange showed all symptoms typical for prolonged exposure to psychological torture, including extreme stress, chronic anxiety and intense psychological trauma.“

In addition to these concerns, reports also indicate Assange is being medicated.

Melzer has also explained that the piling-up of multiple legal proceedings is adding to Assange’s stress and inability to cope with the demands of preparing for his defence. Watch:

.

 It is important to note that Assange’s legal preparations in this case have nothing to do with the spurious bail skipping charges for which Assange was initially apprehended and detained by the British government. Rather, his legal defence involves fighting what could become a defining legal precedent for this generation – an US extradition case where a non-US citizen faces charges under Espionage Act of 1917 for his role (as a journalist) in disclosing war crimes and crimes against humanity by the US government – all published by a non-US media outlet. Therefore, it can be rightly argued that by restricting Assange’s access to a proper legal defence in such a high-profile and historic case, the British government is acting against the public interest, not only domestically, but internationally as well.

Despite all this, Belmarsh appears to have ignored or dismissed concerns about Assange’s inability to access the courts for his defence and is denying him “facilities.”

Belmarsh’s restrictions on Assange’s ability to meet his lawyers, and its refusal to allow him to speak to his US lawyers would seem to undermine the very basis of Article 6, which, according to the CoE guide:

“… guarantees the right of an accused to participate effectively in a criminal trial.”

In recognition of Article 6, the UK government website provides guidance on the right of all prisoners to contact their lawyer:

“Prisoners have rights, including … being able to get in contact with a solicitor.”

Prisoners’ rights are also supported by the UK’s own Citizen’s Advice Bureau (CAB), which provides an advisory service to all prisoners.  The following summarises prisoners’ rights in the particular areas where Assange has requested access to justice but has been denied or restricted such access by Belmarsh.  These are as follows (emphasis added):

It becomes clear, therefore, that Assange is being denied prisoner rights regarding access to justice.  The result of these restrictions on Assange is that he cannot effectively participate in the legal proceedings against him.  Belmarsh’s current restrictions appear to undermine all of his attempts to access each and every avenue of justice, as well as the means required to participate in his legal defence since the time he entered the prison. Such infringements of rights and denial of access to justice are often blamed on shortages, system problems and inefficiencies, and even justified by security and institutional practice. However, all of the British system’s shortcomings in this case could easily be avoided or corrected by prison officials.

In Assange’s case it means his legal team is forced to waste time and resources attempting to gain legal access to justice, including possibly taking legal action against Belmarsh and the British government. It is easy to imagine why authorities are quite happy for that to happen: it’s eating into the time, is draining his legal team’s resources, and causing more litigation to pile up.  There are only so many battles that can be fought; Assange’s appeal against the Belmarsh bail jumping sentence has already been dropped. And while certain restrictions will be less harsh while Assange is likely to be on remand fighting extradition, common sense tells us that the impact of the restrictions in place before then will be highly detrimental to his defence.

‘Access to justice’ has been described by the ECHR as:

“Access to justice enables individuals to protect themselves against infringements of their rights, to remedy civil wrongs, to hold executive power accountable and to defend themselves in criminal proceedings.  It is an important element of the rule of law…”

If we believe that barriers to Assange’s ability to defend himself against extradition are justified on the criteria given by a ‘overstretched and underfunded’ high-security prison system, then we are merely consenting to the erosion of law and accepting in its place rules imposed by the administrators of the state’s institutions – at the expense of an individual’s liberty. These justifications for denying Assange his basic legal right to justice are convenient pretexts for Belmarsh which, on cue, has been co-opted by a political agenda which seeks to enable his rendition to the US.

Double Standards: the Belmarsh ‘prison experience’ according to the governor

Belmarsh is also the state’s prison of choice for Tommy Robinson (real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon), the controversial right-wing personality and founder of the English Defence League.  Robinson was convicted for breaching contempt of court laws for streaming the trial of a sex trafficking grooming gang on Facebook Live outside Leeds court in 2018, and was later convicted as a civil prisoner.



 IMAGE: Robinson famously entered the prison wearing a T-shirt which reads, “Convicted of journalism.”

Unlike Assange who was placed within the general prison population before being placed in healthcare, Robinson’s special placement appears to fall within the Belmarsh category of prisoner who is “requiring specific management arrangements because of their public and media profile” and thus has been isolated from all other prisoners.  As a result, he is held in the high security unit inside Belmarsh.  Civil prisoners are treated the same as convicted prisoners  with some exceptions, one of these being greater visiting rights.  According to one of his recent visitors, Ezra Levant, head of the Canada-based media outlet The Rebel Media, which Robinson has been employed by, he is receiving visitors three or four times a week. Levant also stated that the prison governor, Rob Davis OBE, visits Robinson daily, noting that,

“.. the governor of the prison, the warden as we call it in North America, actually visits him every day even, just for a moment just to say ‘how’s it going.’ I thought that was very interesting. Not only is the is the warden making himself available to Tommy but he’s inspecting to make sure things are well done. I found that very interesting and relieving.”

Another visitor from The Rebel Media, Jessica Swietoniowski, reported that Robinson is allowed to make unlimited phone calls between 9am and 11am each morning, stating:

“… from 9:00 until 11:00 he can be out of his cell, so his cell opens from 9:00 in the morning until 11:00, 11:00 [he] gets back into the cell. So during that time he can exercise and pretty much make as many phone calls as he wants, which is good news.”

It should be noted here that Robinson’s ability to have unfettered access to phone calls is likely because he is a civil prisoner. However, it does demonstrate the gulf in access to resources from one prisoner to the next, and what relatively little facilities Assange is allowed in comparison while attempting to prepare for his legal defence.

Swietoniowski also said that Belmarsh’s governor had “made it an exception for me” to visit Robinson during a Friday August 15th morning visitation session, and that the prison governor was working with “us” (The Rebel Media) to ensure their visits to Belmarsh as “positive as possible.”   This is explained in The Rebel’s ‘prison reports‘ which document their visits to Belmarsh.

It should also be noted that if the governor has made a decision to make a special exception for a media outlet which has employed Robinson and that can reach Robinson’s followers – it is bound to result in positive public relations for Belmarsh, and any by extension any British government officials involved in the process.  Perhaps it is hoped that Belmarsh’s efforts to be supportive might resonate with his followers and help to appease threats of unrest feared by the government. Likewise, in the eyes of Robinson’s right-wing support base, Belmarsh’s overall positive treatment of Robinson could reflect positively on the new Tory government and cabinet led by Boris Johnson as Parliament heads towards a coming general election. It is reasonable to regard this as a likely outcome of the governor’s publicly supportive treatment of Robinson.

Are we seeing the state, through Belmarsh, attempting to placate the followers of one individual while another is denied access to justice?  Is this the guileful agenda now being played out through a politicised prison system?

The stark contrast between the prison’s treatment of two high-profile figures, Robinson and Assange, is certainly evident. While Robinson is being treated fairly and lawfully, Assange is not.

According to John Pilger, the prison governor had also failed to respond to the letter sent by Assange’s lawyer, Gareth Peirce, on 4th June, roughly three months ago, about restrictions placed on Assange’s legal access entitlements.

All the indications strongly suggest that the British state through Belmarsh, seem to be imposing a lawless regime upon Assange, who finds himself yet again fighting for his basic human rights and due process in Britain.",Julian Assange: Deprivation of Justice and Double Standards in Belmarsh Prison,"crime, law and justice",judiciary,2626
728379,thehuffingtonpost,"World Resources Institute World Resources Institute CEO Andrew Steer responded: “Every healthy organization faces challenges from time to time. The key is to use such events as an opportunity to improve the way we operate.”

The World Resources Institute quietly cut ties with former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson after a young woman named the Democrat as one of the powerful men with whom Epstein, the accused pedophile who died Aug. 10 in an apparent suicide in jail, ordered her to have sex. After HuffPost sent questions to a spokesman, WRI emailed its staff late Monday announcing Richardson’s resignation from the board.

The twin scandals highlight the growing tension between the work of big environmental groups and the donors whose celebrity or fortunes help fund it. At a moment when the climate crisis is rapidly worsening, the strife at WRI raises questions about what compromises are worth making in pursuit of new resources and expanded reach.

The problems started last month, when FBI agents arrested Epstein for allegedly sex trafficking dozens of minors in the early 2000s. The accusations put new scrutiny on the moguls and powerbrokers ― including Trump and his predecessor Bill Clinton ― previously accused of raping underage girls provided by the multimillionaire. In court documents unsealed earlier this month, Virginia Giuffre, who accused Epstein of keeping her as a teenage sex slave, said she was directed to have sex with Richardson.

“Governor Bill Richardson felt it was time to resign from the board of the World Resources Institute after serving for more than eight years, a tenure that is longer than most board members’ terms,” the statement read.

Richardson’s name no longer appears on the WRI’s board. His profile on the WRI website now redirects to an error page. WRI declined to comment on the record about Richardson, but confirmed his departure from the 32-member board.

The WRI staff remains in upheaval over the political hobnobbing of Ross, who’s donated about $37 million to WRI, after he hosted a fundraiser earlier this month for Trump. Reelecting a president who’s crippling the U.S. effort to cut climate-changing emissions directly undermines the work WRI is doing, employees said.

“Mr. Ross’s actions pose a serious reputational risk to WRI and materially disadvantages our mission,” the petition reads. “How can we lead on ambitious climate action and work with the most climate-vulnerable communities if our Directors, and by extension our Institute, negate our efforts?”

The petition came after management held a meeting last Thursday with staffers to hear out concerns over Ross’s seat on the board. Employees sent the petition to their bosses on Friday and emailed the document to an all-staff listserv on Monday.

Besides calling for a town-hall-style meeting with Ross, the petition calls for the creation of a “Staff Association” to press for changes to the board, including more diversity and strict rules against acting “publicly in any way that is counter to” WRI’s core mission. The demands also include ending the practice of naming programs, prizes or rooms after benefactors and donors.

Each year, WRI grants a Ross Prize for Cities to a business, nonprofit or local government that brought “transformative change” to a “city’s economic vitality, resilience, environmental sustainability or quality of life.” The award includes a $250,000 prize ― the same amount Ross charged for a VIP ticket to his fundraiser for Trump in the Hamptons earlier this month.

Juggling the interests of donors with the mission of the organization is a high-wire act for environmental groups. In 2012, the Sierra Club took heat for accepting nearly $26 million from the natural gas industry while advocating for the demise of coal, its biggest power sector rival. A year later, the Environmental Defense Fund started facing criticism for its close ties to the billionaire Walmart heirs.

Since then, the climate crisis has grown more urgent. Wildfires scorched the Arctic this summer, emitting more carbon dioxide in June alone than Sweden produces in a full year. An Indian metropolis of roughly 10 million is on the verge of running out of water. July was the hottest month ever recorded.

“We need to put additional scrutiny on these board members to see if they are legitimately representing the public interest or if they’re on there to represent their own particular vested interests,” Brulle said by phone. “That’s the real question for these people.”","Top Environmental Group Faces Upheaval Over Board’s Ties To Jeffrey Epstein, Trump",environment,environmental politics,709

Families could also be stopped from taking pupils out of religious education (RE) lessons by the Welsh government.

It comes as protests against LGBT+ lessons continue to take place outside schools in Birmingham.

Kirsty Williams, education minister in Wales, said she was minded to ensure all young people are required to study RE and RSE in the new curriculum – which will be LGBT+ inclusive.

“It has always been an anomaly that children could be prevented from attending certain subjects,” Ms Williams said.

In a consultation by the government earlier this year, more than four in five (88.7 per cent) of respondents said they wanted parents’ right to withdraw children from lessons to be retained.

Some respondents suggested home schooling could increase if the right was removed.

The Welsh government has launched an eight-week consultation on the plans.

Relationships education in primary schools and sex education in secondary schools will become compulsory in England from 2020.

The announcement prompted a widespread campaign against the plans - including protests at two primary schools in Birmingham

But parents in England will retain the right to withdraw children from sex education until the age of 15.

The Welsh government is also proposing to change the name of RE to ""Religions and Worldviews"".

Kathy Riddick, coordinator of Wales Humanists, welcomed the move to include different religions and humanism in RE.

But she called for parents’ right to remove children from RE to remain.

“We have grave concerns about parents losing their right to withdraw their children from RE in faith schools where they could be subjected to a heavy-handed religious instruction that enforces a particular faith-based perspective,” she said.",Parents in Wales to lose right to remove children from sex education classes,education,parent organisation,279
26393,bbc,"Should parents be told if their children are members of gay-straight alliances - student-run peer support groups for LGBT students and allies in their school? In one Canadian province, that question has sparked fierce debate.

Gay-straight alliances - or GSAs - were first established in the US in the 1980s.

The student-run clubs are meant to be a place where LGBT and other students can socialise and offer peer support. Research on GSAs suggests they create a ""safe space"" for students at a greater risk of mental health issues and discrimination, and can reduce bullying and harassment in schools where they're established.

Some 30 years after the first one was founded by a history teacher and a student at Concord Academy in Massachusetts in 1988, thousands of GSAs exist in middle and high schools across North America.

Despite their proliferation, these peer support groups have also faced resistance.

One protracted battle over GSAs has been playing out in the Canadian province of Alberta - an issue debated in the provincial legislature, in the courts, and in the media.

The latest flare up began during the recent provincial election in the province.

At issue was a policy proposed by United Conservative Party (UCP) leader Jason Kenney to undo some legal protections for the school clubs, notably one that bars school officials from telling parents if their child has joined such a group.

Critics of Kenney's plan say school staff could ""out"" LGBT students to parents who might not be supportive of, or might even be discriminatory of, their sexuality or gender identity - with potentially damaging consequence.

Kenney - whose UCP swept the election and who will soon be premier - argues his proposal is a compromise between supporting GSAs and respecting parental authority.

In his election night victory speech, he said that ""parents know better than politicians what is best for their kids"".

Alberta is not the only place GSAs have caused social friction.

In the United States, where the federal Equal Access Act guarantees that public school students have a right to form GSAs, the American Civil Liberties Union says the groups have prevailed in at least 17 federal lawsuits under the act between 1998 and 2015.

Most of the US lawsuits were over obstacles put in place by school officials opposed to the clubs, like making last minute changes to school rules to prevent a GSA from being established.

Concerns about the activities in GSAs has also cropped up in the US, with one California student battling his school telling the BBC in 2000: ""This whole thing has stopped being about my club. It's become this debate about sex"".

Albertan Dylan Chevalier, executive director of Sexual and Gender Acceptance Edmonton, says GSAs are about ""having a place where you can be safe, relax, and take your walls down for half an hour"".

Chevalier was the president of a GSA at his former high school, and he said the club hosted discussions and pizza parties, held bake sales to fund LGBT awareness campaigns and once organised a ""drag and dance show"".

Local skirmishes over the clubs have also been seen in the UK and in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba, which also protect a student's right to start a GSA.

University of Calgary's Darren Lund, who teaches social justice education, says that the issue has always had ""the potential to be polarising"".

He says there's been a rapid cultural shift towards a greater acceptance of LGBT issues in the last 15 years or so - one that makes some people feel ""discomfort"".

""And then politicians are quick to jump on that fear and use that fear to play into people's insecurities about these issues,"" he says.

In 2014, legislation was first proposed to require all the province's public schools to establish a GSA on the request of a student.

The right-leaning provincial government at the time eventually passed a law - Bill 10 - establishing that protection. It received support from all the provincial political parties.

Some cheered the move, but it also led to protests.

Advocates argued the law didn't do enough to protect LGBT students. Others called it an infringement on freedom of religion and parental rights.

In 2015, the left-leaning NDP swept to power in Alberta and added more protections for GSAs.

It passed Bill 24, which required schools, both public and private, to have a policy in place to allow for it to comply ""immediately"" with a student's GSA request.

Further, school officials would not be allowed to disclose a student's involvement such a club.

""No students will be outed for joining a GSA or a QSA [queer-straight alliance] in the province - it's against the law,"" the provincial education minister said at the time.

Schools were put on notice - if they don't follow the law they risk having accreditation and funding stripped.

Lindsay Peace, who has a son who is transgender and who is an advocate for trans youth in the province, has been a vocal supporter of protecting GSAs.

""I think it's important for kids to know that they belong,"" she says ""And sometimes it's the only place [where they do].""

And as for parents who want to know what their children are up to at school: ""they should ask them"", she says.

In Alberta, the second GSA law was contentious from the get-go.

""This legislation would create a void of care for our children, into which anyone can set up shop, without proper oversight or accountability,"" one parents rights group stated in an op-ed.

The Calgary-based Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms (JCCF) filed a court challenge on behalf of a coalition of parents and 26 faith-based independent schools, arguing bills 10 and 24 breach multiple constitutional rights, including by failing to protect a parent's right to educate based on his or her own conscience and religious beliefs.

It says the law further ""undermines parental rights by prohibiting parents from knowing if their child is being exposed to sexual content through a GSA"".

Court documents filed by the legal group warn that ""the parents are alarmed and frightened at the climate of secrecy that the School Act has created around ideological sexual clubs and related activities"".

JCCF president John Carpay summed up the tension up way: ""The fuss is about making these clubs mandatory in schools where the parents disagree completely with the perspective or the belief system that is being advocated by these clubs"".

""It's the difference between voluntary versus coercive.""

Kenney's proposed policy - to roll back some GSA protections but to keep Bill 10 in place - looks unlikely to satisfy either side.

Says Chevalier: ""He's playing a game. He's pandering to the social conservative side of his base and playing a fast one [with everyone else].""

The JCCF is waiting for a court decision on whether an interim injunction it's seeking on Bill 24 will be granted.

Carpay told the BBC he's uncertain whether the schools his organisation represents will want to continue with the court challenge and fight the 2015 GSA protections that would remain in place if Kenney's government does roll back Bill 24.

Meanwhile, campaigners like Peace and Chevalier say they'll continue to fight for GSA protections in all Alberta schools.

Peace says she thinks it's students themselves who will end up creating more inclusive schools, regardless of how fierce the GSA fight might get between parents and politicians.

Calgary high school students are now organising a province-wide school walkout next month - a few days after Kenney is to take office - to protest his party's GSA plans.",Should these school clubs be kept secret from parents?,education,social learning,1220
427230,prepareforchange,"After the end of World War II, a covert plan to cull the world’s population was put into action. This plan intends to vastly reduce the number of humans on Earth down to as few as 500,000 people.

Throughout the last 15 years, we’ve learned about the global depopulation program. This program was established in the 1940s in an effort to get rid of as many people as possible. The reason for wanting to depopulate the Earth is not yet clear, but there is consensus among well-informed researchers that we are indeed being killed softly and without notice. While many researchers believe the elite’s decision was based on their assessment of future overcrowding and how this would endanger ourselves and the planet, equally in-depth independently gathered information points to a desire to use humanity as a commodity that could later be disposed of.

Since the depopulation program is widely known, one question that should concern us all is, what is the state of this program as we have entered the second decade of the 21st century?

The answer to this questions is that the depopulation program is running in very advanced stages. The West, led by the United States, has implemented a series of policies with the sole intent to drastically reducing human numbers in an attempt to curb what many believe is an out of control population growth. The fact that reproduction rates are out of control is still also debatable, but researchers are now giving more attention to educating the masses about the reality of global depopulation so that they can take matters into their own hands.

In a recent interview with Kevin Galalae, an author and historian who often contributes to this publication, he provided some insight about the progression of the global depopulation program. Mr. Galalae, who has been writing a series of articles on the topic for The Real Agenda News, has alerted us that the policies that govern the plan to reduce human numbers on Earth are progressing rapidly. According to him, the elite are using methods that are more and more invasive because the previous ones they adopted are no longer keeping up with their expectations. Mr. Galalae, believes that the elite understood overpopulation as a time bomb and decided to secretly get rid of us, as supposed to educate us about the urgent need to consciously keep our numbers under control.

The latest addition to the global depopulation program is planetary geo-engineering also known as climatic geo-engineering. This tool, originally begun to be used in the 1940s as a way to wage weather warfare. However, not too long after, governments realized that controlling the weather would be synonymous of controlling their enemies. Today, humanity is the main enemy of the elite, it has always been. We are all that stands between them and their goal of getting human numbers to as little as 500 million people.

While discussing about depopulation efforts conducted by the elite, I realized that perhaps the elite had miscalculated. Perhaps humanity has overcome their lies to learn the truth. So I decided to ask Mr. Galalae about the progress of their agenda.

Luis Miranda: According to your best knowledge, 68 years ago or so, the elite attempted to reduce human population by secretly using chemical and biological weapons. They projected that this plan would reduce population considerably.  By how much?

Kevin Galalae: At first, in the early fifties, the objective was to merely halt population growth and to do so they focused entirely on undermining human fertility to reduce the total fertility rate (TFR) of every country to replacement level.  The implications of this move were not foreseen.  It was not realized that this would set in motion a demographic transition that will result in population profiles characterized by inverted pyramids and therefore the burden the old would place on the productive members of society would become unbearable and collapse the social systems of developed countries, eating away at the affluence gained by previous generations. They did not realize that once you start engineering small families you end up having to kill the old before they bankrupt society. They did not realize the mindboggling economic, social, cultural, political, ethical, moral, and medical ramifications of interfering with the human reproductive system.  No one knew where it would all lead.  No one could foresee.

Luis Miranda: If the depopulation program has not had the results that the elite expected, when will it reach that point?

Kevin Galalae: There were no timetables at first. There was no long-term plan that glimpsed decades into the future. The knowledge for such a plan and the foresight, as well as the statistical data and computing power that enabled long-term projections were non-existent. At its inception and until the 1970s the international community led by the US and the USSR was merely engaged in a desperate attempt to deal with the devastating aftermath of World War II and to prevent a repeat of history, which would now end in assured mutual annihilation due to thedevelopment of nuclear weapons.

Until the Nixon administration the population control timetable has always been dictated by the need to stay ahead of the always impending famine and resource scarcity and to do so they realized they would have to globalize the economy to facilitate the transfer of goods and services across national frontiers so as to better respond to crises situations and to better spread the benefits of development.  That is when globalization began.  And that is when an aggressive depopulation program became inevitable.  Why?  Because once they crunched the numbers it became clear as daylight that the planet could only support at most one billion people at the standard of living North Americans had become accustomed to and America always insisted on protecting its way of life, as have all other affluent countries and people throughout history.

To this day, the optimal number of people the earth can support remains a political decision that is yet to be made and that is being and will continue to be dictated by the lifestyle we want to have as a species.  Peaceful coexistence dictates that to avoid armed conflict we must share the wealth globally without distinction of race or nationality or religion.  Globalization enables us to share the earth’s resources without prejudice and to attain global prosperity.  It forces us to move in tandem and in peace towards an affluent global civilization.  But to achieve this goal we have no choice but to arrest and reverse our numbers.  How many human beings will live on the planet will be dictated by how well we want to live, by how many resources we want to have at our disposal per capita, and on how much the earth can give us without destabilizing its ecosystems.  With the current technology, my estimate is that the earth cannot sustain more than one billion people.

Luis Miranda: How successful has the plan been? Are the efforts keeping up with the rate of reproduction? In other words, if the plan is kept up, will human population peak at 9 billion in 2040? If not, will it peak in 2050 or 2060?

Kevin Galalae: It has been an uphill battle, the greatest battle humanity has ever engaged in, as we have taken on the mightiest natural enemies, the urge to procreate and the instinct to survive.  Every target set in the past to lower the TFR of all countries on earth has been missed.  To this day, many countries have yet to get there, India being the most populous on this list.  The chemical, biological, psychosocial and economic methods, both covert and overt, employed thus far have been only partially successful.  That is why GMOs have been developed.  GMOs represent the last straw, the last hope of the international community to halt and reverse human population covertly.  Judging by the global resistance against GMOs and by the fact that I have exposed the Global Depopulation Policy, the plan will not succeed. That is why policy makers and world leaders need to show courage and stand united in front of the world to announce and implement a global and universal one-child policy for the next three generations or until our numbers are sufficiently low to reestablish balance with nature. Absent such leadership to bring the depopulation effort into the open we are facing disaster and global conflict.

Luis Miranda: Why do you consider citing this projection made by the elite as a fallacy? Is it because it won’t happen or because people use it as if it will be the result of affluence and development?

Kevin Galalae: The latter.  What is a fallacy is the notion that low fertility rates and small families are the natural result of development and affluence.  This is a myth that was created to hide the fact that low fertility rates and small families are the result of covert population control methods: fluoride, BPA, vaccines, HIV/AIDS, artificial scarcity caused by deliberate economic manipulation, eugenic laws, and a battery of psychosocial methods designed to undermine the family.

Overpopulation deniers, however, use this myth to demonstrate that there is no need for population control because the global population is stabilizing on its own at 9 billion.  Overpopulation deniers do not realize that the reason the population will stabilize at 9 billion is because the international community employs a battery of covert methods to undermine human fertility and the family unit and that they have done so in strict secrecy since 1945.  The international community (UN, WHO, IMF, WB, etc.) and the military-industrial complex (especially that of the US, UK and Russia) – the brain and the arm of the globalization/depopulation policy – who have been in control of the secret depopulation program, are prevented from setting overpopulation denies straight by the continuing need to keep the myth alive, a myth which they have created to conceal the truth.

Luis Miranda: Many well-informed people who cite the figure of 9 billion are aware of the elite’s plan to exterminate many of us. They reference the data because they have read it in globalist white papers, speeches, etc.

Kevin Galalae: The data in globalist white papers is attributed to affluence/development so as to hide the true reason of low fertility rates, which are the covert methods I describe in my books and articles.  The need to proceed in secret with depopulation measures has begot deception to bypass democratic processes and the rule of law.  Government and the international community now exist primarily to hide the truth and break the law for that is the only way they can eliminate the vast majority of genetic lines alive today.

Luis Miranda: Knowledgeable people also cite the population peak of 9 billion to make people aware that despite the fact that the elite has planned to exterminate many of us and that the elite’s projection was to have a stable population by 2040, they still continue advancing stronger measures of depopulation.

Kevin Galalae: The reason they advance ever stronger methods of depopulation is because the methods they have employed so far have not been sufficient to reach the desperate goals previously set, goals that have only become more desperate. Desperate times call for desperate measure.   Now we are in do or die time. We no longer have a buffer time, which is why they are going for broke; hence the chemtrails, the GMOs and, soon, pandemic-causing viruses.

Luis Miranda: Could we say that these well informed people have failed to explain to the public that the elite are using more aggressive measures because their initial projection is not going to come to fruition?

Kevin Galalae: Yes, this is indeed the case.  In addition, the environmental impact has become critical.  Also critical are the social and economic strains, due to overcrowding and the need to share the same economic pie with an ever growing number of people, which means that each individual pie is shrinking from year to year, have compelled the authorities to unleash a new generation of population control methods; methods that are far more effective and far less subtle and that can only be forced on us by a police state and police state controls.

They do this not because they like or want tyranny but because we are facing collapse.  They reckon that a pre-emptive strike will prevent chaos.  They reckon that controlled population annihilation is preferable to the global disintegration of civilization into mayhem, which is what will happen if nothing is done.  And while they are right that doing something, however brutal, is better than doing nothing; they are wrong in choosing to go over our heads and against our will and at our cost only.

Humankind is better and smarter than they give us credit for.  We are capable of taking control of the depopulation effort.  We can do it legally and openly with the cooperation of the vast majority of people on earth, which will make the depopulation effort humane and far more effective and will preserve and strengthen the best traits of human nature, as well as our dignity, the intellectual and genetic endowment of humanity, and our rights and freedoms.  The OM Principles show how to protect our children, our planet, our dignity, and our humanity while at the same time accomplishing the hard targets imposed by the existential threats we face.

What stands in the way of the alternative I provide is a crisis of leadership at the top and a crisis of participation at the bottom.  What stands in the way is a general crisis of conscience.

Once people understood that there was a real effort going on to drastically reduce population numbers, they had to cope with the latest weapon used by the elite to carry out mass depopulation. The Global Climate Geo-engineering Program that is being carried out by the elite is perhaps the most effective of all tools they have ever employed. Why? Because different from vaccines, GMOs and other methods used before, spraying the skies with toxic chemicals so people are sistematically poisoned, is something no one can escape from. We all need to breath, don’t we?

One man who has been in the search for answers about Global Climate Geo-engineering for at least two decades is Dane Wigington. Mr. Wigington is well-known in the alternative media movement for his in-depth presentations about what many people call ‘chemtrails’ or chemical trails, which in reality are a form of geo-engineering. The elite has been in the business -there are patents and people are making money of it- for decades and they are not about to stop spraying the skies with their heavy metals just because we’ve found out. For over 70 years, planetary geo-engineering has gone from being a dream of the elite to becoming a reality. The problem is that it has cost humanity more than anyone believed.

According to Mr. Wigington’s research, climate geo-engineering has caused and continues to cause climate related disruptions, many of which are intended to bring down whole nations or at times certain areas of the planet. Global Climate Geo-engineering is responsible for extreme drought, ozone depletion, excessive methane release, drastic reduction in arctic sea ice, global oxygen content reductions, oceans on the brink of collapse, massive fish die offs, the extinction of at least 200 different species a day, a drastic rise in Autism, Alzheimer’s, and Dementia, the reduction of forests worldwide, the sterilization of soils, making it impossible for plants to grow without Monsanto’s aluminum resistant seeds, and yes global warming.

Mr. Wigington backs up his statements with solid data obtained from NOAA, NASA, patent documentation, which can be found on his website geoengineeringwatch.org. “The debate over whether geo-engineering programs are going on is now a moot point. We have more than enough data to confirm it. We have actual footage showing tankers spraying. The materials showing up on the ground are exactly the same materials mentioned in the numerous geo-engineering patents and documents,” says Wigington.

“Our atmosphere is nothing but a massive physics lab to geo-engineering scientists who have no concern whatsoever about the consequences to humanity or any living thing, including themselves. The experiments are literally tearing the planet apart and destroying life on earth.” Mr. Wigington recently explained in a conference in California that there is no such a thing as natural weather anymore. The elite behind the depopulation program are now capable of keeping large areas of the planet in drought while drowning the land across the continent by making it rain uncontrollably.

Climate Engineering Weather Warfare, and the Collapse of Civilization

The government’s covert use of deadly and dangerous Geo-engineering practices, which supposedly attempt to reduce global warming by artificially modifying the Earth’s climate systems through the reduction of solar radiation and the removal of Carbon Dioxide is seriously threatening life on Earth. That is the conclusion Dane Wigington has come to after conducting deep research into the ways that the chemicals sprayed over us are changing the environment. Along with Mr. Wigington’s research, documentaries such as What in the World are they Spraying and Why in the World are They Spraying have shed even more light into the Global Geo-engineering Program.  These documentaries provide scientific commentary and evidence about the toxic effects of such  programs on human life and the negative impact on eco-systems and weather patterns.

Global geo-engineering programs are literally ripping the atmosphere apart and changing climate patterns more rapidly out of control. Earth’s life support systems is also being decimated. The lethally toxic fallout from these same programs is poisoning every breath we take, and the entire web of life. If you think this sounds absurd, or impossible, take the time to examine the evidence yourself. The very essentials needed to sustain life on earth are being recklessly destroyed by these programs. This is not a topic that will begin to affect us in several years, but is now already causing massive animal and plant die off around the world, as well as human illness.

A tool for blowing the Global Climate Geo-engineering Cover up Open

A new initiative based documentary called Look up raises awareness about the current threat that Climate Geo-engineering  poses to planet Earth. Whether the elite began using geo-engineering to curb global warming or are doing solely to cull the global population is not important anymore. Either way, humanity and the rest of the species are being exterminated in the process. Look Up , the film directed by George Barnes, won the Hamptons Film Festival 2013, the AFI World Peace Best Environmental Short Film, the 2013 Action On Film Festival’s Best Documentary Short award, and the 2013 International Film Festival for Peace.

Perhaps part of its success is related to the fact the film comes accompanied by a mobile application called SyderAlert, which mobile phone users can download and use to document weather geo-engineering as it happens. The video captured by witnesses can then be sent to government representatives. The mobile application capture visual evidence of the potentially catastrophic activity, allows users to create petitions against it, and sends the evidence directly to the appropriate representative. Users can have their video automatically geo-located to ensure that the appropriate elected officials are selected.

The genocidal depopulation plan generally involves poisoning or sterilizing people through the use of chem. trails or water fluoridation. Agribusinesses transnational like Monsanto are often implicated in some sort of scheme to monopolize the world’s food supply so it can be easily tainted with deadly toxins. Just about anything that can be said to involve “chemicals” can be implicated in this nefarious scheme: vaccines, alleged covert geo-engineering schemes, genetically modified food, etc. Variants of the theory include those with an anti-abortion tinge who incorporate conspiracy theories about Planned Parenthood, and AIDS conspiracy theorists who believe AIDS was concocted in a laboratory for the purpose of reducing the population. Another variant, largely attributable to Lyndon La Roche, has worldwide nuclear war as part of the conspirators’ alleged plan along with a deliberate economic collapse and de-industrialization to force the world back into a “new dark age.”

Magoti, who works as a public affairs officer with the Legal and Human Rights Center, was abducted on Friday, December 20, 2019, at 10 a.m., as he was on his way to purchase a new mobile phone, according to a statement by the LHRC. Police denied having any information about Magoti’s whereabouts when the LHRC first reported him missing on Friday.

Magoti’s abduction echoes a chilling trend toward the disappearances of journalists, human rights defenders and opposition leaders in Tanzania since 2015 when President John Magufuli first took office.

Later on Friday, the police confirmed that Magoti had been arrested, along with three other unnamed people, on “various allegations,” according to Dar es Salaam police chief Lazaro Mambosasa, as reported by Reuters. However, police have not released information about where Magoti is being held and no official charges have been made as of Saturday, December 21, according to The Citizen.

As one of the most vocal human rights advocacy groups in the nation, the LHRC has spoken out loudly against diminishing press freedoms and opposition repression under President Magufuli’s administration.

Magfuli has denied allegations of cracking down on the media and human rights defenders but ran on a strong campaign to root out corruption in the East African nation. In 2017, he warned that “press freedom has limits.”

Zaituni Njovu, who works with Africa Human Rights Network (AHRN), told Global Voices through a Whatsapp text:

This incident is not good for human rights because everyone has the right to protection and freedom. Mr. Tito [Magoti] has been arrested by civilian police, although at the beginning it was announced to the public that he had been abducted by unknown people. Police [finally] made a formal statement that they arrested him, although they have not said so far [where].

It’s true that human rights defenders [HRDs] are hunted like animals in Tanzania and arrested by police and government agencies — especially when you do your job correctly. In short, it’s not wanted for HRDs to speak at all about anything in TZ [Tanzania]. The human rights situation is unsatisfactory here in TZ [Tanzania]. The safety of HRDs is very low and they are often exposed to adverse events until some [even] lose their lives.

Magoti’s colleagues and friends continue to search for him by making visits to various police stations in Dar es Salaam, inquiring into his safety and whereabouts:

Magoti, who specializes in human rights in business, has worked with the LHRC for three years in Tanzania, where human rights protections have steadily deteriorated.

In early December, in the Magufuli administration’s latest blow to human rights, the government withdrew Tanzanians’ right to “directly seek redress from the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights.”

Netizens came out on Twitter in Magoti’s defense, noting his disappearance and arrest as part of a larger human rights crisis in Tanzania.

Jeff Msangi saw Magoti’s arrest as a major setback for human rights:

Under the hashtags, #BringBackTito and #FreeTitoMagoti, activists and human rights defenders have launched a campaign on social media to find Magoti and ensure justice for him.

Political scientist Aikande C. Kwayu made a call for compassion on Magoti’s behalf:

Magoti’s abduction and arrest mark a disturbing trend in Tanzania, prompting Angela Quintal of Committee to Protect Journalists to tweet:

In July 2019, journalist Erick Kabendera was abducted using similar techniques by six plainclothes policemen in broad daylight. For months, he has languished in prison on trumped-up charges of economic crimes and may face up to 15 years in prison.

Kabendera’s lawyers have said that his arrest was politically motivated.

As a journalist, Kabendera has been critical of the Magufuli administration and produced reports on Tanzania’s divisive politics for international and local media such as The Guardian, African Arguments and The East African.

Kabendera will spend the holidays behind bars as his case has been postponed ten times in court. The next hearing is scheduled for January 2, 2020, the BBC reports.

As Tanzania heads into the new year, human rights defenders, journalists, activists and concerned citizens continue to paza sauti, a Swahili phrase meaning “raise voices,” so that cases like Magoti’s and Kabendera’s don’t go silent.

APEX RF Conditioning supplies distributed radio access networks, antenna systems and assemblies. The Salisbury Times reported Thursday on the expansion announced by its CEO David Chambers. His statement says the current push toward 5G deployment means now is a great time to expand.

The new jobs include engineers, technicians and assemblers. The combined payroll for the new jobs is estimated to exceed $8.5 million annually once the expansion is complete. The timeline is unclear. The Salisbury-Wicomico Economic Development Business Expansion Fund provided some financing to the company, which plans to move to Northwood Industrial Park.

“This is one of the reasons people went to the polls to vote for him—for that wall, and if you ask Republicans who support him and support the wall, they say it’s common sense,” Fox & Friends co-host Ainsley Earhardt said Friday morning.

Trump on Friday morning announced he would sign a compromise funding deal to avert another shutdown but would also declaring a national emergency that would allow him to bypass Congress and reallocate more than $8 billion towards the wall.

“This makes sense,” Hegseth said of the emergency declaration. “And the precedent argument? Listen, liberals and Democrats, if they had power, would do the same thing. There’s also plenty of precedent.”

But Hegseth and the Fox & Friends co-hosts’ staunch support comes just one month after they slammed the national-emergency plans, calling the idea a “disaster in the big picture.”

“[Declaring a national emergency] would just be a disaster in the big picture and just show us being inept and unable to govern around the world and set a terrible precedent,” co-host Brian Kilmeade said on Jan. 10.

On Friday morning, however, Kilmeade seemingly forgot his previous reservations, and lamented that Trump’s decision to issue the third national emergency of his presidency came after multiple attempts to find a solution with Democrats.

“After the 35-day holdout, after the negotiation with 17 bipartisan bicameral, after he sees what’s in front of him, after he only gets hours to read it knowing that the government is about to shut down in a matter of hours, he was going to throw this in the street,” he said. “So this is, ‘I tried.

When asked how Biden’s chances in the primary race will be affected by this, Perez simply said, “That’ll be up for the voters to decide.”",DNC Chair Perez defends free healthcare for illegal immigrants: ‘This is not a handout’,health,healthcare policy,233
927276,thesun,"A SCULPTURE called 'McJesus' which depicts a crucified Ronald McDonald has sparked riots after it was displayed in a museum in the Holy Land.

Hundreds demonstrated at the museum in the northern city of Haifa last week, throwing rocks at police and even attempting to firebomb the building, according to reports.

Israel's Arab Christian minority called for the work's removal while church representatives brought their grievances to the district court, demanding the removal of it and the exhibit's other offensive items, including Barbie doll renditions of a bloodied Jesus and the Virgin Mary.

Israeli police say rioters hurled a firebomb at the museum and threw stones that wounded three officers.

They were forced to disperse angry crowds with tear gas and stun grenades.

Museum director Nissim Tal voiced shock at the outrage, saying the exhibit had been on display for months.

He said the displays were intended to criticise what many view as society's cult-like worship of capitalism.

The same exhibit had toured multiple other countries without incident, he said.

The museum has refused to remove the artwork, but did hand a curtain over the entrance to the exhibit and posted a sign saying the art was not intended to offend.

Tal said: ""This is the maximum that we can do.

""If we take the art down, the next day we'll have politicians demanding we take other things down and we'll end up only with colourful pictures of flowers in the museum.""

""We will be defending freedom of speech, freedom of art, and freedom of culture, and will not take it down.

The unexpected outrage apparently has its roots in images shared on social media.

The Finnish artist who created the artwork, Jani Leinonen, has also asked that it be taken down - but for a different reason.

He would like it taken down as a protest against Israel’s treatment of Palestinians, in order to join a number of other artists who have boycotted the country in recent years.

Wadie Abu Nassar, an adviser to church leaders, said: ""We need to understand that freedom of expression is interpreted in different ways in different societies.

""If this work was directed against non-Christians, the world would be turned upside down.""

Israeli Culture Minister Miri Regev, who has been accused of censorship for pushing legislation mandating national ""loyalty"" in art, also called for the removal of the ""disrespectful"" artwork.

“Putin has revived the Ukrainian nation and its self-consciousness.” A few years ago, Ukrainians protested against the presence of NATO vessels in the black sea. Now they want them there “on a permanent basis.

“As a result of Putin’s efforts, Russia has thrown off the mask of a civilized state and shown the world the bestial grin of a political impotent suffering from resentment.”

5898,activistpost,"At one time, the elite at least attempted to conceal their boundless enthusiasm for population control from the general public, but now they aren’t even trying to hide it anymore.

On Tuesday, an alarming new study that advocates global population control as one of the solutions to the “climate emergency” that we are facing was published in the journal BioScience. This document has already been signed by 11,258 scientists from 153 different countries, and it openly calls for a reduction in the human population of our planet. This has always been the endgame for the climate change cult, but now a big push is being made to make the public believe that there is a “scientific consensus” that this is necessary.

You can find a summary of the report here, and I would very much encourage you to read it, because it is essentially a blueprint for where the elite intend to take humanity in the years ahead.

But in order to achieve their goals, first they are going to have to convince us that planetary disaster is imminent, and in this study the authors boldly tell us “that planet Earth is facing a climate emergency”…

So what solutions are they proposing?

Well, the study breaks down the necessary solutions into six basic groupings…

If that sounds a lot like “the Green New Deal”, that is because it is a lot like “the Green New Deal”.

It is the sixth “objective” that concerns me the most. Because the truth is that they don’t want to just “stabilize” the global population.

According to the study, the population of the Earth really needs to be “gradually reduced”…

But if humans are the primary driver of climate change, and if we only have about 12 years before we reach the point of no return as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has suggested, will a “gradual” reduction of the human population really be enough to satisfy the climate change zealots?

For true believers in the cause, there would be no faster way of turning this crisis around than to radically reduce the population of the planet. According to them, every one of us has “a carbon footprint”, and as the population grows the climate change crisis only gets worse. So a logical extension of this thinking would be that anyone that can find a way to significantly reduce the global population would literally be “saving the planet”. To you and I, the idea of millions or billions of people dying is absolutely horrific, but for those that have fully embraced the climate change narrative such an outcome would be extremely desirable.

And of course population control has been an obsession among the global elite for a very long time. Way before “global warming” and “climate change” were popularized, those at the top end of the social pyramid have been dreaming of dramatically culling the herd.

To demonstrate this, I would like to share with you 45 quotes that prove the elite really do want to dramatically reduce the number of people on the planet…

1. Charles Darwin (his thinking is at the foundation of so many of our scientific theories today): “At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace throughout the world the savage races. At the same time the anthropomorphous apes, as Professor Schaaffhausen has remarked, will no doubt be exterminated. The break will then be rendered wider, for it will intervene between man in a more civilised state as we may hope, than the Caucasian and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as at present between the negro or Australian and the gorilla.”

2. Bill Gates: “The problem is that the population is growing the fastest where people are less able to deal with it. So it’s in the very poorest places that you’re going to have a tripling in population by 2050. (…) And we’ve got to make sure that we help out with the tools now so that they don’t have an impossible situation later.”

3. Bernie Sanders: “In poor countries around the world where women do not necessarily want to have large numbers of babies, and where they can have the opportunity through birth control to control the number of kids they have, is something I very, very strongly support.”

4. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson: “The primary challenge facing our species is the reproduction of our species itself…It is time we had a grown-up discussion about the optimum quantity of human beings in this country and on this planet…All the evidence shows that we can help reduce population growth, and world poverty, by promoting literacy and female emancipation and access to birth control.”

5. UK Television Presenter Sir David Attenborough: “The human population can no longer be allowed to grow in the same old uncontrolled way. If we do not take charge of our population size, then nature will do it for us.”

6. Paul Ehrlich, a former science adviser to president George W. Bush and the author of “The Population Bomb”: “Solving the population problem is not going to solve the problems of racism… of sexism… of religious intolerance… of war… of gross economic inequality. But if you don’t solve the population problem, you’re not going to solve any of those problems. Whatever problem you’re interested in, you’re not going to solve it unless you also solve the population problem.”

7. Dave Foreman, the co-founder of Earth First: “We humans have become a disease, the Humanpox.”

8. CNN Founder Ted Turner: “A total population of 250-300 million people, a 95% decline from present levels, would be ideal.”

9. Japan’s Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso: about medical patients with serious illnesses: “You cannot sleep well when you think it’s all paid by the government. This won’t be solved unless you let them hurry up and die.”

10. David Rockefeller: “The negative impact of population growth on all of our planetary ecosystems is becoming appallingly evident.”

11. Richard Branson: “The truth is this: the Earth cannot provide enough food and fresh water for 10 billion people, never mind homes, never mind roads, hospitals and schools.”

12. Environmental activist Roger Martin: “On a finite planet, the optimum population providing the best quality of life for all, is clearly much smaller than the maximum, permitting bare survival. The more we are, the less for each; fewer people mean better lives.”

13. HBO personality Bill Maher: “I’m pro-choice, I’m for assisted suicide, I’m for regular suicide, I’m for whatever gets the freeway moving – that’s what I’m for. It’s too crowded, the planet is too crowded and we need to promote death.”

14. Al Gore: “One of the things we could do about it is to change the technologies, to put out less of this pollution, to stabilize the population, and one of the principal ways of doing that is to empower and educate girls and women. You have to have ubiquitous availability of fertility management so women can choose how many children to have, the spacing of the children… You have to educate girls and empower women. And that’s the most powerful leveraging factor, and when that happens, then the population begins to stabilize and societies begin to make better choices and more balanced choices.”

15. MIT professor Penny Chisholm: “The real trick is, in terms of trying to level off at someplace lower than that 9 billion, is to get the birthrates in the developing countries to drop as fast as we can. And that will determine the level at which humans will level off on earth.”

16. Julia Whitty, a columnist for Mother Jones: “The only known solution to ecological overshoot is to decelerate our population growth faster than it’s decelerating now and eventually reverse it—at the same time we slow and eventually reverse the rate at which we consume the planet’s resources. Success in these twin endeavors will crack our most pressing global issues: climate change, food scarcity, water supplies, immigration, health care, biodiversity loss, even war. On one front, we’ve already made unprecedented strides, reducing global fertility from an average 4.92 children per woman in 1950 to 2.56 today—an accomplishment of trial and sometimes brutally coercive error, but also a result of one woman at a time making her individual choices. The speed of this childbearing revolution, swimming hard against biological programming, rates as perhaps our greatest collective feat to date.”

17. Colorado State University Professor Philip Cafaro in a paper entitled “Climate Ethics and Population Policy”: “Ending human population growth is almost certainly a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for preventing catastrophic global climate change. Indeed, significantly reducing current human numbers may be necessary in order to do so.“

18. Professor of Biology at the University of Texas at Austin Eric R. Pianka: “I have two grandchildren and I want them to inherit a stable Earth. But I fear for them. Humans have overpopulated the Earth and in the process have created an ideal nutritional substrate on which bacteria and viruses (microbes) will grow and prosper. We are behaving like bacteria growing on an agar plate, flourishing until natural limits are reached or until another microbe colonizes and takes over, using them as their resource. In addition to our extremely high population density, we are social and mobile, exactly the conditions that favor growth and spread of pathogenic (disease-causing) microbes. I believe it is only a matter of time until microbes once again assert control over our population, since we are unwilling to control it ourselves. This idea has been espoused by ecologists for at least four decades and is nothing new. People just don’t want to hear it.”

19. Kofi Annan, UN Secretary-General from 1997-2006: “The idea that population growth guarantees a better life — financially or otherwise — is a myth that only those who sell nappies, prams and the like have any right to believe.”

20. Thoraya Ahmed Obaid, UN Under-Secretary-General from 2000-2010: “We cannot confront the massive challenges of poverty, hunger, disease and environmental destruction unless we address issues of population and reproductive health.”

21. Bill Nye: “In 1750, there were about a billion humans in the world. Now, there are well over seven billion people in the world. It more than doubled in my lifetime. So all these people trying to live the way we live in the developed world is filling the atmosphere with a great deal more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases than existed a couple of centuries ago. It’s the speed at which it is changing that is going to be troublesome for so many large populations of humans around the world.”

22. Actress Cameron Diaz: “I think women are afraid to say that they don’t want children because they’re going to get shunned. But I think that’s changing too now. I have more girlfriends who don’t have kids than those that do. And, honestly? We don’t need any more kids. We have plenty of people on this planet.”

23. Democrat strategist Steven Rattner: “WE need death panels. Well, maybe not death panels, exactly, but unless we start allocating health care resources more prudently — rationing, by its proper name — the exploding cost of Medicare will swamp the federal budget.”

24. Matthew Yglesias, a business and economics correspondent for Slate, in an article entitled “The Case for Death Panels, in One Chart”: “But not only is this health care spending on the elderly the key issue in the federal budget, our disproportionate allocation of health care dollars to old people surely accounts for the remarkable lack of apparent cost effectiveness of the American health care system. When the patient is already over 80, the simple fact of the matter is that no amount of treatment is going to work miracles in terms of life expectancy or quality of life.”

25. Planned Parenthood Founder Margaret Sanger: “All of our problems are the result of overbreeding among the working class”

26. Gloria Steinem: “Everybody with a womb doesn’t have to have a child any more than everybody with vocal chords has to be an opera singer.”

27. Jane Goodall: “It’s our population growth that underlies just about every single one of the problems that we’ve inflicted on the planet. If there were just a few of us, then the nasty things we do wouldn’t really matter and Mother Nature would take care of it — but there are so many of us.”

28. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: “Frankly I had thought that at the time Roe was decided, there was concern about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we don’t want to have too many of.”

29. Planned Parenthood Founder Margaret Sanger: “The most merciful thing that the large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it.”

30. Salon columnist Mary Elizabeth Williams in an article entitled “So What If Abortion Ends Life?”: “All life is not equal. That’s a difficult thing for liberals like me to talk about, lest we wind up looking like death-panel-loving, kill-your-grandma-and-your-precious-baby storm troopers. Yet a fetus can be a human life without having the same rights as the woman in whose body it resides.”

31. Paul Ehrlich: “Basically, then, there are only two kinds of solutions to the population problem. One is a ‘birth rate solution,’ in which we find ways to lower the birth rate. The other is a ‘death rate solution,’ in which ways to raise the death rate — war, famine, pestilence — find us.”

32. Alberto Giubilini of Monash University in Melbourne, Australia and Francesca Minerva of the University of Melbourne in a paper published in the Journal of Medical Ethics: “[W]hen circumstances occur after birth such that they would have justified abortion, what we call after-birth abortion should be permissible. … [W]e propose to call this practice ‘after-birth abortion’, rather than ‘infanticide,’ to emphasize that the moral status of the individual killed is comparable with that of a fetus … rather than to that of a child. Therefore, we claim that killing a newborn could be ethically permissible in all the circumstances where abortion would be. Such circumstances include cases where the newborn has the potential to have an (at least) acceptable life, but the well-being of the family is at risk.”",45 Population Control Quotes That Show The Elite Are Quite Eager To Reduce The Number Of People On The Planet,society,demographics,2344
10607,aljazeera,"The trial of Loujain al-Hathloul, one of nearly a dozen prominent Saudi Arabian women's rights activists jailed since last year, will begin on Wednesday, her family has said.

Dozens of other activists, intellectuals and clerics have been arrested separately in the past two years in an apparent bid to stamp out opposition to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has consolidated power, including through a sweeping anti-corruption campaign.

""My sister @LoujainHathloul will be having her first trial session next Wednesday at 8am at the specialised court in Riyadh. This is the court [that] deals with terrorism cases,"" her brother Walid wrote on Sunday on Twitter.

He said she was not allowed to have a lawyer and had not been provided with a list of indictments.

The public prosecutor said last June that five men and four women had been arrested and held on suspicion of harming the country's interests and offering support to hostile elements abroad. Saudi media widely denounced them as traitors.

It was unclear if the other detainees will also stand trial this week.

Activists claim some detainees, including 29-year-old Hathloul, were held in solitary confinement and subjected to mistreatment and torture, including electric shocks, flogging, and sexual assault. Saudi officials have denied those allegations as ""false"".

The arrests have intensified international criticism of Saudi Arabia after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last October in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul sparked global outrage.

Three dozen countries, including all 28 European Union members, called on Riyadh last week to release the activists, the first rebuke of the kingdom at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) since it was set up in 2006.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his British counterpart have also said they raised the issue with the Saudi authorities during recent visits.

The Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the public prosecutor's office said earlier this month it had completed its investigations of the detainees and was preparing their trials.

Hathloul, who advocated an end to a ban on women driving and the kingdom's male guardianship system, was previously jailed for 73 days in 2014 after she attempted to drive into Saudi Arabia from the United Arab Emirates.

The driving ban was lifted in June, weeks after she was rearrested. The guardianship system, which requires women to obtain the consent of a male relative for major decisions, remains intact.",Trial of prominent Saudi woman activist to start this week,"crime, law and justice",justice,391

In an emotional message shared on Mencap’s official website, Harington wrote: “To those of you who set this page up in my name and to those of you who contributed and left messages, please accept my deepest and most heartfelt thank you.

“This donations page lifted my heart and brought tears to my eyes, what a beautiful gift to receive… how generous from you all.

“Mencap is a truly wonderful charity and the money given here will go to the most incredible cause.”

The star signed off his message by sending “love and respect from beyond the wall.”

Harington has been an ambassador for Mencap since 2016 and fronted a video campaign for the charity the following year.

Fans started the JustGiving page after the Game of Thrones finale as a way of thanking the star for “the sheer amount of love and skill he put into Jon Snow for us to enjoy.”

288101,lewrockwell,"I generally resent recommending art for political reasons. I believe art and beauty transcend ideology and should be judged on aesthetic merit first and foremost. In the case of “Richard Jewell,” however, the unusual point of view moves the film in a novel direction and makes it a compelling standout feature.

Director Clint Eastwood is an avowed libertarian, and “Richard Jewell” is probably the single most self-consciously libertarian film he’s ever made.

Of course, I don’t understand everything about Eastwood’s brand of libertarianism. His support of gun control, for instance, is a major departure from libertarianism. It’s also hard to take his 2012 Chrysler Super Bowl commercial as anything other than support for the Obama auto bailout, even if Eastwood claimed that’s not what he intended. Moreover, the actor/director has endorsed an array of big-government politicians in California. Amazon.com Gift Card i... Buy New $25.00

I am going to give Eastwood a pass on all of that, however, because his job isn’t to be consistent. His job is to create compelling cinema, and he delivers that, film after film.

“Richard Jewell” is probably not his strongest work. It leaves little room for suspense and is a bit predictable, in part because we all know the story: Security guard Richard Jewell find a suspicious backpack at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, which turns out to be a bomb that kills two people and injures more than 100. At first heralded as a hero, Jewell soon becomes the FBI’s primary suspect and the target of a media rampage.

It is exquisitely acted, however, with Eastwood’s minimalist directing style shining through. The characters Eastwood introduces are as familiar to the American psyche as they are unusual to meet onscreen: a hard-working and loving, if TV-addicted, single mom; a geeky, libertarian lawyer; an overweight, overzealous copper.

The cop is an interesting stage in the artistic trajectory of the director, whose iconic ’70s role was “Dirty Harry,” the out-of-bounds police officer pursuing rough justice in San Francisco, a city gone awry. My guess is that Eastwood feels more like the libertarian lawyer these days.

1110213,wnd,"It's a stunning court decision: An Islamic mosque must be removed from land that is considered sacred and it will be replaced with an ancient temple that reportedly once stood there.

This decision, however, is not about Jerusalem's Temple Mount and the admittedly unsolvable dispute between those who support the al-Aqsa Mosque there and those who believe it is the site of the former Jewish temples of history, and of the future Jewish temple of prophecy.

This one is about a situation in India, although reports confirm ""some see this as a precedent paving the way for the return of a Jewish Temple.""

It is Breaking Israel News that is reporting on the situation.

The report cites the decision from the Supreme Court of India, all 1,182 pages, that ""ruled an ancient temple must be rebuilt and a mosque that was built in its place must be relocated elsewhere.""

The decision came in a decades-long legal fight over the small parcel of land in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh.

The five judges agreed ""to allow the rebuilding of the Hindu temple and the relocation of the Muslim mosque claimed to have been built on its ruins in 1528. According to the court's decision, all disputed territory would pass to the Hindu 'temple groups' as they are known in India.""

The fight actually started back in the 1980s when Hindu groups claimed the right to rebuild their temple, originally built in the 10th century, on the site of an Islamic mosque that had been erected somewhere in the 16th century.

The first court decision was to divide the 2.8 acres of land into three parcels.

But given the fact a survey ""determined that the remains of a 10th-century temple existed under the mosque,"" the high court said it should be handed over to Hindus.

The Muslims were provided an alternate site for their mosque, the report said.

Islamic officials refused to accept the result and ""threatened a violent reaction,"" the report said.

""Justice was not done fully as Muslims cannot shift the mosque, therefore, accepting an alternative land for the mosque is absolutely out of the question,"" the Sunni Waqf board said in a statement. ""While the legal option is available, there is also Shariah obligation to defend the masjid till the last breath.""

Mordechai Kedar, of Bar-Ilan University, explained why such an issue is so important to Muslims.

""Islam is, at its core, replacement theology,"" Kedar told BIN. ""Not only do they see themselves as the proper replacement for all previous beliefs, but they also believe that everything in those beliefs belongs to Islam. All of the figures in the Bible are Muslims. Muslims claim that Jesus and all of the figures in the New Testament are Muslim.""

He said one of the practices of Islam is to ""take over"" the holy sites for other faiths.

Reported BIN, ""Assaf Fried, the spokesman for the Temple Organizations, noted the unmistakable similarities between the case in India and the situation on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.""

He explained, ""This is a powerful precedent. The situation is precisely like the one in Jerusalem. Though it cannot be used in Israeli jurisprudence, conceptually, it is compelling.""

BIN reported, ""Yaakov Hayman, chairman of the United Temple Movements, agreed that the case in India was identical to the situation at the Temple Mount but he did not feel the same tactic would work in Israel.""","Court rules mosque must go, ancient temple restored",religion and belief,religious facilities,549
758027,theindependent,"The forest floor is a graveyard, covered with fallen spruce and oak trees. But beneath the broken limbs and rotting leaves, thousands of species of insects are feeding in Bialowieza Forest. Fungi of many types are found only here and sprout year-round. More are discovered every year.

More than 200 species of birds, including rare woodpeckers and owls, fill the air with song.

“There is more life in a dead spruce than a living one,” says Professor Rafal Kowalczyk, the leader of the Mammal Research Institute at the Polish Academy of Sciences, during a tour of the forest – one of Europe’s last remaining primeval forests and part of an ecosystem largely untouched since the last glaciers receded from the continent more than 10,000 years ago.

It has been more than a year since the European Court of Justice ordered an end to logging in the forest, finding that it posed a clear threat to the world heritage site.

The scars, though, are still visible – from the tracks gouged into the earth by the heavy machinery used to cut down thousands of ancient trees to the gaping holes in the canopy created by their removal.

The ruling was a major defeat for Poland’s governing Law and Justice party, which supported the logging. Warsaw initially defied the court order, but relented when faced with a fine of €100,000 (about £87,000) for each day it violated the directive.

The battle over Bialowieza is just one of many being waged by the right-wing government against the European Union, which has accused Poland of posing a risk to democratic values and the rule of law by trying to pack its courts and restrict press freedoms.

Now there are fears that the Polish government is once again drawing up plans to increase logging in the area, skirting the ruling by increasing the quota for wood in the hundreds of square miles of forest that lies outside the boundaries of the world heritage site.

The protected part of the Bialowieza woodland, which covers about 550 square miles and extends into neighbouring Belarus, was long the hunting ground for European nobility and royalty, including Lithuanian dukes, Polish kings and Russian czars.

During the German occupation of Poland, Hermann Göring was so enamoured of the forest that he drew up plans to create the world’s largest hunting grounds and establish a Nazi Jurassic Park of sorts, reintroducing prehistoric animals to the landscape.

As a playground of the rich and powerful, Bialowieza was spared the fate of so many of the continent’s other forests, most of which were razed and some of which were turned into intensively controlled versions of nature.

The order imposed on some of these European forests is remarkable.

Armies of forest rangers relentlessly clear dead wood and undergrowth to create near perfect carpets beneath the pines. The woods can feel more like nurseries than wild spaces.

“We have forgotten what nature looks like,” Kowalczyk says.

But Bialowieza has remained wild and unruly.

Its remoteness and mostly pristine condition helped make it the site of one of the continent’s great conservation victories – the reintroduction of bison after the last free-roaming animal was hunted and killed in 1919.

The forest is now home to Europe’s largest herd of bison, or wisent.

“Most people, when they think about forests, think about managed nature,” says Kowalczyk, who first came to Bialowieza in the 1980s. “This place is so different than any forest I had ever seen.”

While the bison was a big success story, a much smaller creature, the hairy little bark beetle, set off the logging fight.

Spruce trees, especially when in a weakened state, make a perfect mating ground for the beetles. The male bores into the tree, creating a chamber where he will release pheromones to attract females. He will mate with several of them, who in turn will deposit dozens of eggs in the chamber before flying off to find new mates.

The larvae left behind will feed on the vascular tissue of the tree. By the time they pupate, the damage they have done often has sucked the life from the spruce.

The tracks from the beetles, known as printers, can still be spotted in felled trees all across the forest.

Warmer winters, brought on by climate change, have allowed the population to explode. And the preference of forest managers for spruce trees has expanded the territory where they can thrive.

By 2016, it was clear that the beetle infestation in Bialowieza was devastating large tracts of trees.

For many scientists, the best way to manage the infestation was to leave it alone, letting nature take its course.

“The bark beetle has been a part of the ecosystem for hundreds of years,” says Adam Bohdan, a biologist from the Wild Poland Foundation. “This phenomenon is a natural adaptation to the new climate situation.”

But the Polish government did not agree. It argued that the lack of human intervention in the forest would doom it.

So Jan Szyszko, the environment minister at the time, ordered a large-scale logging campaign, allowing heavy machinery to roll into pristine areas of woodland.

“We will rebuild the valuable habitats in the Bialowieza Forest by removing dead trees as much as is necessary and restoring the oaks and ashes,” Szyszko declared in 2016.

The move was greeted with outrage, with protesters descending on the forest, setting up an encampment and forming human blockades to try to stop the heavy machinery.

An army of more than 1,000 forest rangers from around the country was dispatched to a small village on the border of Belarus ready to confront the activists.

At times, tempers boiled over into violence. Skirmishes broke out as activists engaged in coordinated acts of civil disobedience.

But it was not until the European court threatened financial penalties that the logging ended.

A report issued by Unesco in February found that the “logging operations and other forest management activities have disrupted the ecological and natural processes in the property”.

But it was not beyond repair, according to the report. And the forest is much quieter now. New life is replacing the old, although beetles remain a problem with no easy solution.

232900,greenwichtime,"GREENWICH — Firefighters worked through the day to extinguish a blaze that tore through a home on Whitney Drive in the northwest corner of town on Friday and left it uninhabitable.

No injuries were reported, but the damaging fire is certain to renew debate about emergency response times in the neighborhood, which lags behind other sections of Greenwich.

“On arrival, we had heavy smoke conditions, and determined that fire was present on the first third of the main floor. It already extended up to the attic space,” Deputy Chief Brian Koczak said.

There are no hydrants in the area to draw water from, so the fire department relied on a “tanker relay” system, ferrying water from the nearby Tamarack Country Club to douse the flames.

“That whole water supply is a big thing to coordinate,” Koczak said. But there was no problem with getting water onto the flames: Tankers from departments in nearby Westchester County, N.Y., Banksville and Armonk, assisted in the operation.

The fire proved to be a stubborn one — it took an extensive effort to break through plywood and sheetrock to extinguish the flames in the attic of the large raised ranch home, he said. The fire was under control in about 45 minutes, and about 40 to 50 fire personnel took part in the daylong operation.

First Selectman Fred Camillo thanked the first-responders via Twitter on Friday afternoon, noting their “mission was complete without any injuries.”

No one was home at the time of the fire. The cause of the blaze at the home, in a neighborhood off the upper section of King Street near the Westchester County Airport, had not been determined Friday evening.

The fire department’s records showed that the call came in at 10:39 a.m., and the first unit arrived at 10:50, for a response time of 11 minutes.

Response times by firefighters to the northwestern quadrant of town has been a persistent concern in the neighborhood. Residents and leaders in northwest Greenwich have pushed for a fire station to be built closer to their homes, as the neighborhood has no dedicated fire facility based within it.

The engine company based in Glenville is closest to the northwest section of town, but it is several miles away from many residential areas. The scene of the fire on Friday was 5 miles from the Glenville engine company’s headquarters.

Former First Selectman Peter Tesei noted the issue on Twitter on Friday. While in office, he had pushed for a new fire station in the northwest corner but ran into opposition from budget-hawks in town government. The Representative Town Meeting did not approve funding proposed by Tesei.

“Good luck @Greenwich_Fire_ hope BET & RTM BOC had stop watches out to track response time to Northwest Greenwich!!. #SafetyFirst #GreenwichFirst be safe & thank you,” Tesei said on Twitter.

In the summer of 2018, it took firefighters 11 minutes to respond to a house fire at an unoccupied home at 1415 King St. No one was injured in that blaze, but the house was destroyed. The response time in many other sections of Greenwich averages about five minutes, or well under in some sections of the south end of town.

The house damaged in Friday’s fire was declared uninhabitable by the fire marshal after sustaining significant damage. The raised ranch house, with six bedrooms and four bathrooms, sold for $1.415 million in 2016, according to real-estate records.",Greenwich home heavily damaged by fire,"disaster, accident and emergency incident",emergency response,555

CorePower, a celebrity favorite hot yoga studio, has one of the toughest classes of all - YogaSculpt, a hot yoga, cardio, and sculpting class that works every single muscle in your entire body.

The Big Bang Theory actress Kaley Cuoco told Shape that she owes her abs entirely to the hardcore yoga studio, which has locations all across the United States.

“I go to a place called CorePower Yoga. One morning I’ll take the Hot Power Fusion class, which is an amazing calorie burner. Or I’ll take a Yoga Sculpt class, where we wear three-pound weights during yoga moves. The sculpt classes include 20 seconds of mountain climbing or jumping jacks between the poses, so I get cardio, too.”

Cuoco’s not the only celebrity who credits the workout with toning her body. Dancer Julianne Hough stopped by the Minneapolis location to show off her moves and used the workout to prep for her wedding.

“I get bored easily, so I like to switch it up...I do CorePower yoga,"" she told Self. Her brother, fellow dancer Derek Hough, has also taken part in the classes.

If you’re considering venturing to CorePower, there's a few things to know about the fitness mini-chain's signature classes.

The classes are separated into levels and the site is clear about what to expect.

CorePower Yoga 1 is a Vinyasa class that can reach 85 degrees, but is unheated with no added humidity. The class simply heats up because of prior classes held in the same studio.

CorePower Yoga 1.5 is hotter and reaches temperatures of 90 degrees. It also has added humidity, so prepare to sweat profusely.

Yoga 2 focuses on strength and balance, hitting 98 degrees - just like the boy band.

But the most intense challenge might just be YogaSculpt, a class which combines yoga, cardio and (you guessed it) sculpting.

During YogaSculpt, the practice room is heated to between 90 and 93 degrees; so prepare to sweat the moment you enter the space. Classes usually start with everyone lying down on the mat, basking in the heat. You'll want to wear a sports bra and tank top - don't opt for a t-shirt and full leggings.

The YogaSculpt class is split up into sections. The first is a yoga flow, then sculpting with weights and then a quick cardio burst, which includes plenty of jumping jacks. The cardio portion only lasts for three minutes but it feels much, much longer.

This isn’t the type of class where you can grab a quick drink after or head into the office. Post-practice, you'll mostly just want to shower and feel particularly drained.

The instructors urge class-goers to give it all they’ve got in the last few minutes. Once you do, you won't have much to give after class - but you will have Hollywood abs.",CorePower hot yoga and cardio: The celebrity workout Kaley Cuoco and Julianne Hough swear by,lifestyle and leisure,exercise and fitness,461

77562,breitbart,"The House Judiciary Committee’s new report accompanying articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump accuses him of committing the crimes of bribery and honest services fraud, though neither is mentioned in the articles of impeachment.

The report, released Monday ahead of Wednesday’s anticipated vote on impeachment, accuses Trump of violating 18 U.S.C. § 201 — federal criminal bribery — because he “demanded” an announcement of investigations, which the report describes as a thing of “value.” In return, the report alleges, the president was influenced in his performance of official acts. (The report disagrees with recent Supreme Court precedent that a “meeting” is not an “official act.”) In addition, the report rejects that there was “any public purpose” associated with Trump’s request for investigations.

Moreover, the Judiciary Committee report adds a new, previously undebated crime — namely, honest services fraud: “In addition to committing the crime of bribery, President Trump knowingly and willfully orchestrated a scheme to defraud the American people of his honest services as President of the United States. In doing so, he betrayed his position of trust and the duty he owed the citizenry to be an honest fiduciary of their trust,” the report declares.

The two crimes appear to have been included in the report to address Republican criticisms that President Trump has not been accused of violating any law, making him the first president to be impeached without a crime alleged.

However, the articles of impeachment do not refer to either crime. The absence of “bribery” was noteworthy, as the Democrats had suggested for weeks that they planned to impeach the president on that basis.

177557,eveningstandard,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have come a long way since meeting in 2003 at the University of St. Andrews. There's been an engagement, a wedding, three children... and, for Kate, the minor life adjustments that come with marrying into one of the world's most famous families.

They say a shared sense of humour is the key to a successful relationship - and in Kate and Will's case, their 15 years as a couple (eight of them married) - has involved plenty of inter-couple bantz about, among other things, Kate's bad cooking and Will's hair loss.

In the filmed interview following their engagement announcement, interviewer Tom Bradby asked if it was true that Kate had once had a poster of Prince William on her bedroom wall.

“It wasn’t just one, it was like ten, twenty [posters]"" Will joked.

""He wishes"" Kate replied, adding “No, I had the Levi’s guy on my bedroom wall, not a picture of William. Sorry.”

The Duke and Duchess were at the Global Ministerial Mental Health Summit in October when Colombian fine artist Dario Vargas asked if they wanted to contribute to the painting he was creating. Tentatively, Kate added some paint onto the canvas, asking ""Where can I hide it?""

Her husband said: ""It’s pretty much ruined the picture.""

Launching the Nursing Now global campaign at St. Thomas' Hospital in February this year, the then-pregnant Kate joked with a parent of one of the patients who told her, ""Congratulations, best of luck with the third one.""

The Duke and Duchess were at a Taste of Norfolk event in aid of East Anglia’s Children’s Hospice in 2016 when Kate told a group of chefs, ""William has to put up with my cooking most of the time"".

Her husband replied: ""It’s the reason I’m so skinny.""

Opening a recreation facility on a UK military base in Cyprus on December 5, Prince William warned the soldiers: ""Keep the pizza off the sofas!""

""Do you want me to move out of the photo,"" the Prince joked. ""My wife's camouflaged against the tree!""

Visiting a school to launch their Heads Together campaign in 2016, William spoke to the school children and their parents about his childhood.

""Sometimes I still feel like I am 16, to be honest sometimes I still act like I am 16,"" he said.

On a trip to Warsaw in 2017 Kate was presented with a cuddly toy used to soothe newborns. ""We will just have to have more babies"" she said, turning to her husband.

Prince William was abseiling down a 12-metre wall in an outdoor centre in North Wales, as Kate stood at the top holding onto his rope

""Are you holding me?"" William asked. ""I've got you,"" Kate responded, before adding, ""I'm rather enjoying this actually - for once I'm in control.""

With the Prince then well into his descent, Kate shouted down at him: ""William - how much do you love me?""

The couple were at the Royal Easter Show at Sydney Olympic Park in Australia in 2014. Watching a shearing demonstration, at one point they were handed a tuft of alpaca wool, which Kate suggested he put it on his head.

""You need it more than me"" she said, pointing to his bald patch and laughing.

The two were answering phone calls to raise money for the ICAP charity day in December 2015.

William overheard Kate talking to a caller named Andrew, and he blurted out: ""Catherine, I think you can stop flirting with them now"" before turning to a broker, raising his eyebrow and muttering: ""Sorry my wife is just embarrassing me""",Happy Birthday Prince William!

1063072,unian,"The first week of July was revolutionary for the Ukrainian energy market: its new model started working, the essence of which is that henceforth energy companies will buy electricity at electronic biddings. Previously, the electricity market worked on the principle of all generating companies supplying electricity produced to the state-owned Energorynok at a price set by the National Energy and Utilities Regulations Commission (NEURC). After that, it was electricity suppliers who purchased electricity and redirected it to consumers.

The deep reform of the market was long overdue as well as the transition to European rules. The Ukrainian power industry was on the verge of a crisis: mutual debts without sources of coverage were formed, estimated at UAH 30 billion, low prices for the households were covered by the high cost of electricity for the industry, energy infrastructure failed to receive billions of hryvnias in investments required, while excessive over-regulation led to enormous corruption in the sector.

Therefore, in April 2017, the Parliament adopted a reformist Law on the Electricity Market. It provides for the introduction of more transparent and competitive relations in the energy market, and also meets the requirements of the Third EU Energy Package. Two years were allocated for its implementation.

It is worth noting that the experience of European countries that have carried out such reforms in their countries has shown that at first, following innovations, there will be a significant increase in prices for consumers. After upgrading, creating competition, and adapting to new conditions, prices will decrease, but this will take time – several years. It is clear that this may cause a wave of discontent among the population, already agitated by rising tariffs.

To prevent social unrest and not to harm the economy, the government introduced temporary restrictive measures. The Cabinet of Ministers passed a resolution on special obligations, according to which the state-owned Energoatom will have to sell no more than 90% of its electricity at a fixed price, and Ukrhydroenergo – no more than 35%. This decision will prevent the increase in electricity prices for the households.

In addition, the NEURC set a weighted average price for electricity for industrial consumers at UAH 1.62/kWh.

On July 1, during the first bidding, the price on the market was formed at a level below the established limits. For coal generation (producing the most expensive electricity, not counting alternative generation, which does not participate in the market), the price was set at UAH 1.59/kWh, which is 2% below the weighted average.

Thus, a new electricity market, although within certain limitations, has finally been launched. Ukraine is now facing tasks just as complex, both technical and political: to open the market for the households, bring software maintenance to perfection, ensure competition, and prevent monopolization, integrate the Ukrainian energy system into the EU market, and protect the reform from dubious judicial rulings and the someone's will to curb it.

This week, the Cabinet of Ministers at its regular meeting approved First Deputy Minister of Economic Development and Trade Maksym Nefyodov as head of the State Customs Service. Prime Minister volodymyr Groysman expressed support for Nefyodov and noted that, together with the new prestigious status, he received an ""order"" to start war with shadow businesses.

""Maksym Nefyodov, today you will receive an order to start war with shadow businesses. And as I once supported ProZorro and deregulation, I'll also support your work at customs. We need the result: [goods of] clean businesses must be cleared rapidly, while all shady schemes must be eliminated at the systemic level. And I am convinced that we can do it together,"" Groysman said.

Nefyodov thanked the government for its support and promised to implement a quality reform of the customs service.

""I would very much like the Verkhovna Rada to support us in the implementation of reform. For my part, I can guarantee that I will not become richer in this office, I will be open to business, and I can guarantee that we will achieve the result that we have shown in many other areas like deregulation or public procurement. We are really pleasantly surprising our international partners,"" the newly appointed head of the agency noted.

He promised to eliminate the existing fiscal imbalance in customs, so that the agency staff would focus not on the process of collecting duties and filling the state budget, but on ensuring security and facilitating international trade.

Among his priorities as head of the customs service, Nefyodov also called the need to create an electronic customs office and synchronize its work with the customs authorities of other states. In his opinion, this will eliminate corruption. He also promised to increase the salaries of customs operatives to encourage them to work honestly.

""We need to create decent conditions for customs officers and revise their salaries. This is not a problem of customs alone, it is a problem of the entire civil service. Unfortunately, high-quality personnel have left the customs. Almost all the possibilities regarding the development of IT-products have been destroyed,"" the official added.

In addition, Nefyodov considers it necessary to update the customs infrastructure to speed up the processing of export-import operations.

Another major development of the outgoing week was a new wave of forex deregulation. On Monday, July 1, the National Bank canceled a number of administrative restrictions that created inconvenience to Ukrainian companies, foreign investors, and diplomatic missions.

The regulator has canceled the cap on financing foreign representative offices and separate divisions of companies. Previously, there was a general limit on investing abroad for businesses at EUR 2 million per year. At the same time, to minimize the risks of unproductive outflow of capital, the National Bank ordered that banks receive detailed estimates from companies and other documents with a justification that these transactions are really necessary. Also, this easing will not apply to transactions on transfering funds to the aggressor or occupier states, offshore zones, and countries violating FATF recommendations.

In addition, the regulator simplified the reinvestment of foreign investors' income from transactions with Ukrainian securities, by allowing the funds received on securities in a foreign depositary bank to be transferred from the correspondent account of this institution to its account in Ukraine. The NBU has expanded the list of transactions that are allowed to be conducted in Ukraine in foreign currency, supplementing it with operations between financial institutions and the Cabinet of Ministers in the framework of international agreements on credits, grants, and loans.

Also in the first week of July, the State Fiscal Service made another gift to businesses by granting 239 Ukrainian enterprises the status of authorized exporter, which will allow them to export goods to the EU under simplified conditions. At the same time, the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine extended the term for granting by customs of the said status to the exporting enterprises from thirty to ninety calendar days from the date of receipt of the corresponding application.

Incidentally, in the outgoing week, the European Commission reported that over the past twelve months, Ukraine entered the TOP 3 of largest agricultural suppliers to the EU, having delivered such goods worth almost EUR 6.3 billion. On year, imports of agriproducts from Ukraine grew by EUR 0.8 billion, or 14%.

Week-start will be important with regard to Ukraine's movement toward Europe as the Ukraine-EU summit will be held in Kyiv, in which all key leaders of the European Union will take part. In addition, in the second week of July, the Ukrainian parliament will continue its work in a session mode and may adopt a number of important laws, while the State Statistics Service will report on the inflation rate for the first summer month.","Week's balance: Launch of energy market, forex easing, and Nefyodov starting war against shadow businesses","economy, business and finance",market and exchange,1255
1087891,veteranstoday,"[ Editor’s Note: I find it amazing that lay Catholics have sat on their asses and just endured being quasi-servants to an international pedophile ring. But that I don’t mean of course that all of the priesthood were pedophiles, but that they were either pedophiles or “aider and abettors”, and I use that terminology for a specific reason.

We have had US statues on the books regarding what qualifies as criminal abuse against children. The clearest case to use as an example is the stepfather shacking up with down trodden mother and daughter.

If the mother knows her child is being abused, but does not want to report is as she will lose her meal ticket, she is charged with a Class A felony along with the new hubby or boyfriend.

This statue can grab anyone that could be proven to have know what was going on and did not reporting, and thus were guilty of aiding and abetting of the abuse continuing. This was considered as horrendous and act as the primary abuser.

Enter stage left, the Catholic priesthood, who I can assure you always knew what was going on, including all of those at the top. Yet in the US, where we have this statute, it was never broadly use, nor was the RICO statute of running an ongoing criminal enterprise.

In fact, all those involved in pushing that problem into civil settlement versus the criminal charges they deserved, a case could be made that they were aiding and abetting themselves.

The proof of that is in the historical record that the Vatican continued it attempts to hide the extant of this crime against humanity, which it was do to its size and longevity. Catholic priests have been abusing children since the beginning.

So my advice to all lay Catholics is to do what you should have done ages ago, put the Vatican into receivership for its horrendous history of sexual abuse and take over your church from top to bottom, clean house and run it yourselves. You can hire and fire priests as needs and run the organization from the top down as many other have done, where at least in scale have not abused children as much.

Here in the US the main problem with the Protestants has been the “youth directors” who just can’t resist the cute teen girls. When caught, neither the parents or the church want the matter public so how it was usually handle, was a copy of what the Catholic Church did, they just move the offender to another church far away.

I know this as a had a close friend, divorced from a Protestant minister who watch all this going on, like the phone calls where the decision was made that “if you take our bad apple, we will take yours”. Of course they would threaten the offenders that they were only getting one free pass.

So again to all you lay Catholics out there, take over your church and run it, where you hired and fire priest as you need or want, or use lay priests, and turn the Vatican into a historical-tourist attraction and have control over all of its assets and archives.

There is no telling what you will find in there, built on the bones of millions of Catholics who surrendered their church to what today can be viewed as an ongoing criminal enterprise, not something I am inventing today, but a felony statute created to deal with large organize criminal activity. Let me know what you think in the comments… Jim W. Dean ]

An increasing percentage of Catholics in the United States are re-examining their commitment to the religion as more allegations of sexual abuse by priests are being revealed, according to a new poll.

Some 37 percent of US Catholics say news of the sex abuse of young people by priests has led them to question whether they would remain in the church, a Gallup poll released Wednesday finds.

Gallup said the figure was 22 percent in 2002, when the church was dealing with a similar crisis in the US.

The last time Gallup polled about this was 2002 after The Boston Globenewspaper reported on widespread abuse by Catholic priests in the Boston area and church leaders’ efforts to prevent the abuse from becoming public knowledge.

Gallup’s latest findings show that the current scandal is affecting US Catholics more than the one in 2002 did.

A significant number of both practicing and nonpracticing Catholics say they are considering leaving the church but those less committed to their religion are more likely to be questioning it, the survey found.

Whereas 46 percent of Catholics who seldom or never attend church say they have questioned whether they would remain in the faith, 37 percent of those who attend church on a monthly basis and 22 percent who attend weekly say the same.

Amid the latest scandal, about one in four US Catholics say they have very little or no confidence in US bishops and other Catholic leaders. Only 40 percent of US Catholics say they have a “great deal” of confidence in Pope Francis.

Since the first high-profile abuse allegations against Catholic priests emerged in 2002 in Boston, many similar cases have rocked the Church, and 2018 brought another wave of such charges.

The credibility of the Catholic Church hierarchy sank last year after new reports of old sexual abuse and cover-up were uncovered in the US, Chile and elsewhere and implicated Pope Francis himself.

Mathew Schmalz, an expert on the Church and religious studies professor at the College of The Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, says the Church may never regain its lost credibility.

In January, a former Catholic priest who had admitted to sexually abusing boys in Pennsylvania was sentenced to up to 14 years in prison – the second clergyman to be jailed in the wake of the state’s sex misconduct report.

Former US Cardinal Theodore McCarrick was expelled by Pope Francis from the Roman Catholic priesthood in February after he was found guilty of sexual crimes against teenage boys and adult males, according to the Vatican.

McCarrick, 88, who resigned from the Vatican’s College of Cardinals in July, became the first Roman Catholic bishop in nearly 100 years to lose the title of cardinal for sex abuse.",More US Catholics consider leaving religion over sex abuse: Poll,religion and belief,religious text,1056

 IMAGE: The imposing and stunning sight of Church Rock in the Navajo Nation, located in northwestern New Mexico.

Here is the true cost of the American empire.

In 1945, the first atomic bomb was tested at the U.S. defense facility at Alamogordo, New Mexico. Just 34 years later, the area also suffered the worst nuclear waste disaster in its history – which did not receive nearly as much media and political attention than other high-profile incidents. And there is a reason for this.

On July 16, 1979, at the Church Rock uranium mines, occurred the worst spill of radioactivity release to our environment in the history of the nuclear industry. The radiation is invisible to this day, still devastating communities living along the Puerco River in northwestern New Mexico. There you will witness the devastation wrought on residents, including high levels of cancer, as well as the impact of other toxic substances left-over from the Church Rock disaster.

In the words of Larry King, an underground surveyor at the United Nuclear Corporation’s Church Rock Uranium mine in New Mexico, “Three Mile Island had more coverage and people were compensated right away.” He added, “I always say we don’t get the same attention because we live in impoverished native community… We live in a sacrifice zone.”

After 40 years, the problem still persists, and appears to much larger than previously thought.

Early in the summer of 1979, Larry King, an underground surveyor at the United Nuclear Corporation’s Church Rock Uranium mine in New Mexico, began noticing something unusual when looking at the south side of the tailings dam. That massive earthen wall was responsible for holding back thousands of tons of toxic water and waste produced by the mine and the nearby mill that extracted uranium from raw ore. And as King saw, there were “fist-sized cracks” developing in that wall. He measured them, reported them to his supervisors, and didn’t think anything more of it.

A few weeks later, at 5:30 a.m. on July 16, 1979, the dam failed, releasing 1,100 tons of uranium waste and 94 million gallons of radioactive water into the Rio Puerco and through Navajo lands, a toxic flood that had devastating consequences on the surrounding area.

“The water, filled with acids from the milling process, twisted a metal culvert in the Puerco,” according to Judy Pasternak’s book Yellow Dirt: A Poisoned Land and the Betrayal of the Navajos. “Sheep keeled over and died, and crops curdled along the banks. The surge of radiation was detected as far away as Sanders, Arizona, fifty miles downstream.” According to a Nuclear Regulatory Commission report, radioactivity levels in the Puerco near the breached dam were 7,000 times that of what is allowed in drinking water.

The heavily contaminated water flowed over the river banks, creating radioactive pools. “There were children up and down the river playing in those stagnant pools, and they were deadly poisonous,” Jorge Winterer, a doctor with Indian Health Service in Gallup, New Mexico, said after the spill.

Earlier this year, standing in his yard next to an old Chevy, King pointed in the direction of the now dry Rio Puerco. “It came right through there,” said King. The unleashed river of waste had flowed through his family’s land just a half-mile from his house. “I remember the terrible odor and the yellowish color of the water.” He recalls seeing an elderly woman who had burned her feet crossing the Puerco while watering her sheep that day.

King still lives on the family land, two miles downstream of the rebuilt dam in the Church Rock chapter of the Navajo Nation. His home is surrounded by a beautiful, unforgiving landscape of red rock cliffs, a scattering of Navajo residences and, if you look closely, fencelines with KEEP OUT signs marking the numerous abandoned uranium sites.

Forty years later, the Church Rock spill remains the largest single largest accidental release of radioactivity in U.S. history, worse in terms of total radiation than that of the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island and second in world history only to the 1986 Chernobyl catastrophe, both of which have loomed much larger in the cultural imagination. The effects of the spill have lingered for an entire generation: In 2007, the Church Rock Uranium Mining Project found widespread contamination of drinking water sources in the Church Rock area.

Navajo residents say they have not been given the attention given to other victims of nuclear accidents, even as they remain under the catastrophe’s long shadow, dealing with poisoned livestock and ongoing health problems amid other aftereffects. “We have never been a priority,” said King. “Forty years after the spill and nothing has been done.”

“Our generation is afraid of having children,” said Faith Baldwin, who grew up on the Navajo nation surrounded by abandoned uranium mines. “Cancer runs in our family but it shouldn’t. Cancer, diabetes were nonexistent in Navajo rez.”

(…) For many residents, the spill has come to embody the broader toxic legacy of the uranium industry on the indigenous lands of the West. According to the EPA, there are over 500 abandoned uranium mines, mill sites, and waste piles on Navajo Nation land that continue to contaminate water, soil, livestock and housing.

“The Church Rock spill symbolizes the governmental and societal indifference to the impacts of uranium development on Indigenous lands,” said Jantz. “The Church Rock spill is the third largest nuclear accident after Fukushima and Chernobyl, and the largest in the US in terms of radiation released, but nobody knows about it.”",America’s Forgotten Nuclear Disaster: Church Rock Still Poisoning Navajo Tribe 40 Years Later,"disaster, accident and emergency incident",accident and emergency incident,908
432744,prisonplanet,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has launched a new round of monetary stimulus to give the economy a boost in the face of global uncertainties like the US-China trade conflict and Brexit.

The central bank, which acts for the 19 countries that use the euro, sparked the anger of US President Donald Trump when it revealed plans to cut the rate on deposits it takes from banks to minus 0.5 per cent from minus 0.4 per cent.

That is a penalty rate that pushes banks to lend excess cash, but was a smaller cut than the market was hoping for.

Trump took the move as a cue to lash out at the US Federal Reserve on Twitter.

‘European Central Bank, acting quickly, Cuts Rates 10 Basis Points. They are trying, and succeeding, in depreciating the Euro against the Very strong Dollar, hurting U.S. exports…. And the Fed sits, and sits, and sits. They get paid to borrow money, while we are paying interest!’ he said.

It marks the second time this year that the US president has accused the ECB of unfairly driving down the euro.

Trump has long been urging the Fed to slash rates, but the US organisation has for the most part resisted.

291789,liveaction,"Planned Parenthood claims to be a health care organization, but it isn’t actual health care that is increasing there; it’s abortion. The corporation’s abortion market share has steadily increased (due in part to half a billion dollars they receive from taxpayers annually), while actual health care services are plummeting. That is because Planned Parenthood is focused on abortion, a point made more evident in the recent ousting of the group’s physician president, Dr. Leana Wen, for her resistance to prioritize and politicize abortion.

Despite Planned Parenthood’s receipt of nearly half a billion in taxpayer dollars annually since 2009 (and hundreds of millions prior to that), Planned Parenthood has chosen to shutter the same facilities they have claimed are needed by those who are poor and disadvantaged. In addition, the corporation is seeing a significant decrease in patients as well as declining health services.

The data in the image below, taken directly from Planned Parenthood’s annual reports from 2006 to 2016, reveal that health care services at the nation’s largest abortion business have been dropping for years:

The decline continued into 2017, the last year which saw a published report from the abortion business. Even after increased government funding and excess revenue reaching hundreds of millions of dollars, actual health care services dropped while abortions again rose.

Between 2007 and 2017, data from Planned Parenthood’s published annual reports reveal the following decreases:

Increases at Planned Parenthood between 2007 to 2017 include:

READ: Planned Parenthood prez Leana Wen wasn’t fighting hard enough for abortion. So they fired her.

In 2017 alone, Planned Parenthood reported 117 abortions for every adoption referral, ending the lives of 912 preborn babies at a rate of 38 per hour, or one abortion every 95 seconds. Planned Parenthood’s abortion market share currently stands at 35.9% when compared to the most recent data from the Guttmacher Institute for 2014. Since CDC abortion numbers are generally much lower than numbers released by Guttmacher (Planned Parenthood’s former “special affiliate”), Live Action News compares market share to Guttmacher. This number may increase after Guttmacher releases new figures. This means that one corporation alone, Planned Parenthood, commits nearly 36% of all U.S. abortions.

Planned Parenthood’s estimated abortion revenue, according to an analysis by Live Action News, was estimated at $190 million in just 2017. This translates into an estimated 52 percent of the corporation’s non-government health services revenue and 11.4 percent of total revenue. Planned Parenthood collected a whopping $244.8 million in excess revenue over spending in just one year, according to its 2017-2018 annual report. The graph below shows massive millions were pocketed by the corporation in years prior.

In 2018, Planned Parenthood set out to protect those gains by vowing to spend millions to elect pro-abortion lawmakers, even hiring a new director to push for activist judges in the courts. The taxpayer-funded organization then released a focused plan for 2019, which included not the expansion of health care, but abortion.",Planned Parenthood’s plummeting health services over the years show an increased abortion focus,health,health organisations,457
111120,cnsnews,"Remember when Democrats complained that $5.7 billion for a border wall was too expensive? Well, that's chump change compared to what many of the congressional Democrats and nearly all of those 15 declared Democrats in the presidential race are now rallying behind.

The price tag isn't in the billions but in the tens of trillions. President Trump was attacked earlier this month by Democrats for a budget blueprint that would run fiscal deficits of 5 percent of GDP. That's too high, for sure, but count up the spending plans of Democrats and deficits could easily hit 20 to 30 percent of GDP and tilt the nation toward Greek and Puerto Rican-style bankruptcy.

Let's start to add it all up.

Start with ""Medicare for All,"" the new health care anthem of the left. It is touted as a way to make medical services ""free"" for everyone. The cost to taxpayers? By some estimates, $32 trillion over the next decade, according to a study by the Mercatus Center. Medicare, just for the seniors it was designed to cover, is already projected to run deficits in the tens of trillions of dollars over the next four decades, according to the program's own Trustees.

Then there is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's ""Green New Deal,"" which is supposed to turn America into an eco-friendly paradise and avert the apocalypse that Ocasio-Cortez claims will occur in just over a decade. At least four presidential candidates have endorsed some or all of that agenda.

Of course, the politicians pushing these plans remain suspiciously quiet whenever they're asked to explain exactly how much their pet projects will cost U.S. taxpayers and whether they're worth the investment. But thanks to public-policy watchdog groups, we have some preliminary estimates. According to one recent study by the American Action Forum, the ""Low-carbon Electricity Grid"" proposed in the Green New Deal will cost taxpayers $5.4 trillion over 10 years or $39,000 per household.

Similarly, a ""Net Zero Emissions Transportation System,"" another part of the environmental proposal, could require as much as to $2.7 trillion or $20,000 per household, while ""Guaranteed Green Housing"" could cost an additional $4.2 trillion.

The Democrat-backed welfare programs in the Green New Deal are even more daunting. According to the study, ""guaranteed jobs"" and ""universal health care"" would together cost each American family as much as $582,000 or $80.6 trillion in total.

Then there is the loss of as many as 10 million jobs in the oil, gas and coal industries, which would add to welfare and unemployment benefit costs, let alone the severe financial hardship this would impose on millions of middle-class families whom Democrats once said they cared about.

Added together, these preliminary Democratic proposals are projected to cost about $92 trillion over 10 years.

But wait, there's more.

Another hot proposal on the left gaining momentum is called ""universal basic income."" Everybody gets a free check from the government. A key sponsor of this is U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California, a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination. This would give families making less than $100,000 a check of up to $6,000 from the government every year. ""Americans are working harder than ever but stagnant wages mean they can't keep up with cost of living increases,"" Harris says.

Then there is the cost of ""free"" college tuition, another federal freebie supported by Democrats. That would add trillions more to the taxpayer tab over the next decade while further inflating the outrageous tuitions that universities already charge.

The $15-an-hour minimum wage would also impose new costs on government at every level.

Now the latest craze on the left is for ""reparations"" payments for slavery. Julian Castro and other presidential wannabes have endorsed this radical income redistribution scheme. A 2015 study by a professor at the University of Connecticut estimates that the cost of reparations would be between $5.9 and $14.2 trillion. These results were published in the Social Sciences Quarterly journal.

Add it all up and the estimated 10-year cost of creating the Democratic-socialist utopia envisioned by the likes of Ocasio-Cortez, Sen. Bernie Sanders and other leaders of the Democratic Party reaches well north of $100 trillion.

Who will be left to pay for the Democrats' America when everything is ""free""? To the extent that any of the Democrats currently running for president has offered an answer to this question, they've invariably claimed that they would finance their schemes by levying punitive taxes on ""the wealthy."" But even if you took every penny of income from every millionaire and billionaire in America, it wouldn't even pay half the cost. Some say we will just put it on the federal credit card. President Obama took our national debt from $10 trillion to nearly $20 trillion, but that might be loose change compared to the new spending spree.

Ultimately, the burden of paying for this radical transformation of America would fall predominantly on the middle class, as usual. Just one example: Many Europeans pay gas taxes that are double what we pay in the United States. That's part of the tab for their green energy policies that Democrats are eager to bring here. Anyone want to pay $5 a gallon to fill up?

The Democrats balked at spending $5.7 billion to protect American communities by securing the border, but they're perfectly happy to mortgage our future by spending nearly 20,000 times that amount on their own utopian fantasies. We will all have everything we want, and our country will be bankrupt.

643140,thedailyrecord,"Heavy snow is set to hit Scotland as forecasters warn of travel disruption across the country.

The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for snow and ice with large parts of the country likely to be affected by the drop in temperature.

A warning for snow starts at 2pm today and runs until 11.59pm tonight, with around 10cm predicted to fall in some areas.

As a result of the snow it is expected transport will be affected in some places.

Forecasters have said there could be delays on roads and railways.

The yellow warning affects Central, Tayside and Fife, Grampian, the Highlands and Strathclyde.

A Met Office spokesperson said: ""A band of rain with snow falling above around 300m is expected to move across Scotland on Monday afternoon and evening.

""1-3 cm of snow is likely above 300m with 10cm of snow above 500m. Temporary blizzard conditions are also likely with strong winds.""

Tomorrow a warning for ice has been put in place for the entire mainland and the Western Isles.

The mercury is set to plummet from midnight until noon.

Rain, sleet and snow is expected to fall throughout the course of tomorrow.

A Met Office spokesperson added: ""A band of rain and hill snow will move southeastwards across the UK during Monday evening and overnight.

""A brief spell of wet snow is possible on high ground of southern Scotland, northern England and north Wales, with some small accumulations possible.

""Behind this surface temperatures will rapidly fall away with some ice forming on some surfaces.

""Once the rain has cleared, some hail, sleet and snow showers will follow from the northwest, with 1-3 cm above 200 metres and some small accumulations expected at lower levels.""

Simon Partridge, of the Met Office, added: ""It's already picking up over the western Highlands and is most likely over the high grounds with guaranteed snow at 200-300 metres.

""For now, after the main band is cleared up by about 9/10pm, showers will follow, meaning sleet and snow will lap up on any snow already there.

""You're looking a potential case of nearly 10cm of snow in areas above 500m.

""Some snow could be seen on the lower levels, so it's not exclusively left to the high ground - but it could end up being rain, snow, rain.

""So, on and off there could be snow from now until the early hours of Wednesday for the west of Scotland, and the best part of 24 hours.""

""The main problem is that skies become clear so there's an ice risk after midnight which could cause some big issues during the overnight period.

""There'll be further showers tomorrow with some hail and sleet along the coasts, on the hills and mountains you can see it turning into snow.""",Snow and ice weather warning issued as temperatures across Scotland set to plummet,weather,weather warning,443
830103,therightscoop,"Unfortunately Pope Francis has become the victim of ‘fake news’ regarding comments he made recently to a group of high school students in Rome. I’m not going to name names, but I do want to point out that articles saying things like Pope Francis told Christians not to try and convert nonbelievers are simply wrong.

Instead of unpacking all the misinterpretations of what is being said about the Pope’s remarks, let’s just start with what the Pope actually said, via Bing translation:

Good morning, Your Holiness, I wanted to ask you a question. If an atheist came to you and asked her for a fundamental reason to start believing what would she say to him? The first is everything. In front of a non-believer, the last thing I have to do is try to convince him. Never. The last thing I need to do is talk. I have to live consistent with my faith. And it will be my testimony that awakens the curiosity of the other who says, “But why do you do this?” And there I can speak. But listen, never, ever bring the gospel proselytizing. If someone says that he is a disciple of Jesus and comes to you with proselytism, he is not a disciple of Jesus. Proselytism is not done, the Church does not grow out of proselytism. Pope Benedict said it grows by attraction, by witness. Proselytism is done by football teams, this can be done, political parties, you can do it there but with faith no proselytizing. And if someone says to me, “But why?” Read, read, read the gospel, this is my faith. But no pressure.

The first thing Pope Francis says here is that we should LIVE the love of Christ Jesus in our lives through action and deed, that we shouldn’t depend on convincing non-believers with words. He argues that it’s our actions and deeds that will arouse the curiosity of non-believers. Then, when someone asks why we do what we do, we have a strong basis on which to begin a dialogue.

Now I admittedly don’t know exactly what he means by ‘proselytising’, per se. But it sounds to me that in the context of his remarks, the Pope believes that ‘proselytising’ is trying to pressure someone into believing in Jesus with words. Or as we say around here, to argue someone into the Kingdom.

The Pope isn’t saying we shouldn’t dialogue with people about our faith. Rather, he’s simply saying that we should bring the Gospel of Christ to people through action and deed and not through argument and pressure. This is what the Bible calls us to do in passage after passage. We are called to let our light shine before men, to care for the widow and the poor. Not trying to beat people over the head with a Bible.

That’s all the Pope is saying here as you can plainly see in his words.

And remember, the Pope is talking to high school students who more than likely put a premium on their own words, as many of us did at that age. As the leader of the Church, he’s simply trying to show them that loving people through action and deed is far more effective than words.","NO, Pope Francis is NOT saying Christians shouldn’t try and convert non-believers…",religion and belief,religious leader,536

The freshman congresswoman tore into Nielsen on Twitter Tuesday night — saying the now-retired DHS secretary doesn’t deserve to get a “lucrative deal” or “prestigious” new post — on account of her role in last year’s family separation crisis.

“In stealing 1000s of children, deporting their parents,& refusing to provide info for reunification, Sec. Nielsen oversaw one of the largest-scale human rights violations in recent history,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “Awarding her a lucrative deal or prestigious post is to legitimize+celebrate that abuse.”

The New York lawmaker had been responding to a post from Rolling Stone writer Jamil Smith, suggesting that Nielsen “be a pariah for life.”

“No cable deals, no cushy college gigs,” Smith tweeted, attaching a link a New York Times column by Michelle Goldberg “on what should happen to the Trump foot soldiers who think that they can escape with their reputations intact simply because they were following orders.”

Nielsen resigned on Sunday following a meeting with President Trump. Scholars and media figures have been signing a petition to make sure she doesn’t quickly find work again.

“Jesse Eisinger at ProPublica thinks that Nielsen might quickly find a berth at a think-tank, university center or similar institution,” said petition writer and political scientist Henry Farrell, of Washington University. “Different people have different limits. Nielsen is some distance beyond mine. If she gets a position at a think-tank, university center or similar, I will not participate on any panel that involves anyone from that think-tank, center or other institution.

220974,freedombunker,"Chicago impounds thousands of people's cars a year, including cars owned by people who have committed no crime, and forces them through an expensive, bureaucratic maze to get their car back. This process that violates residents' constitutional rights, according to a new lawsuit filed against the city Monday evening.

The Institute for Justice filed a class-action lawsuit in Illinois state court alleging that Chicago's impound program violates residents' guarantee of due process, as well as protections against excessive fines and unreasonable seizures, under both the Illinois and U.S. constitutions.

""Owners find themselves in a labyrinthine impound system that is plagued by serious procedural flaws,"" the suit says. ""Even innocent owners get caught up in this system, facing hefty fines and fees when someone else used their car to commit a crime without the car owner's knowledge.""

A Reason investigation published last year described how Chicago's punitive impound program soaks people in fines and fees and deprives them indefinitely of their transportation, whether or not they actually committed an offense, in an effort to reduce its massive annual budget deficits. It also operates independently from the state's courts, meaning that even in cases where a defendant beats a criminal charge and/or a civil asset forfeiture case, they can still be found liable for thousands of dollars in fines and storage fees, and have their cars held until they pay or relinquish them to the city, by Chicago.

That's exactly what happened to Spencer Byrd, a 51-year-old resident of Harvey, Illinois whose impound case was featured by Reason and is now a named plaintiff in the Institute for Justice lawsuit.

Byrd, a part-time auto mechanic says he was giving a client a lift in his 1996 Cadillac DeVille one evening in June, 2016, when he was pulled over by Chicago police and searched. Byrd was clean, but his passenger, a man he says he'd never met before, had heroin in his pocket.

The police released Byrd without charging him with a crime, but his car was seized and dually claimed by both the Cook County State Attorney's Office and the city of Chicago. He's been fighting for nearly three years to get it back.

A state judge ordered Byrd's car released after he filed a financial hardship motion, but the city refused to return it, claiming he owed money under the city's municipal code.

Even after a state judge declared Byrd innocent in the civil forfeiture case against his Cadillac in Illinois state court, he was still found liable for violating Chicago's municipal code in the city's administrative hearings court, which has a low standard of evidence and almost no procedural protections for defendants.

In the meantime, Byrd's livelihood has suffered. His primary trade is carpentry, but his tools have been locked in his car since it was impounded. The city has refused to let him retrieve them, or his car, until he pays his accumulated fines and fees, which according to the lawsuit now stand at more than $17,000.

""If you do wrong, fine, but I didn't do nothing wrong,"" Byrd tells Reason. ""I should have had my car released to me with no fines or anything—thank you, sorry for the inconvenience, and I'm on my merry way—instead of trying to get some type of revenue from me. I was proven innocent, and they still didn't want to act right.""

Byrd is far from alone. A WBEZ analysis of Chicago's massive impound program found that in 2017 alone, the city impounded more than 22,000 cars for violations of its municipal code, which includes dozens of impoundable offenses ranging from drug possession to drag racing to having illegal fireworks.

The fines for those violations are steep, ranging from $500 to $3,000, and that doesn't include towing and storage fees, which accumulate at $20 a day for the first five days, and $35 a a day after that. Given that these cases can take weeks, if not months, to wind through the system, the fees can often exceed the fines themselves.

A Reason analysis of data from the Chicago Administrative Hearings Department showed Chicago fined motorists $17 million over a 12-month period between 2017 and 2018. About $10 million of those fines were for driving on a suspended license, and more than $3 million were for drug offenses like the one that resulted in the impoundment of Byrd's car.

Chicago can hold seized cars indefinitely. There is also no statute of limitations on impound fines and fees in Chicago. The debt can follow someone for life.

Chicago's impound racket is both easy to be ensnared in and hard to escape. There are only three narrow defenses for those whose cars are impounded for municipal violations in Chicago, and being an innocent owner isn't one of them.

""You're talking about a lot of money for something that you may not have been responsible for,"" says Institute for Justice attorney Diana Simpson. ""The lack of an innocent owner protection really violates two different kinds of constitutional protections: both the excessive fines and fees protection, as well as due process.""

The case of two of the other named plaintiffs in the Institute for Justice lawsuit, Jerome Davis and Veronica Walker-Davis, exemplify what critics say is the procedural nightmare people face when their cars are impounded in Chicago.

In May of last year, the couple dropped their 2006 Lexus off at a Chicago body shop following an accident. When the repairs dragged on for longer than expected, the shop first said it was waiting for parts, but eventually the couple learned the truth: An employee of the shop had driven their car on a suspended license and was pulled over. Their Lexus was now sitting at one of Chicago's six impound lots.

The city had never informed the couple that their car had been impounded, according to the lawsuit, and Veronica Walker-Davis had to travel in person to the city's administrative hearings building to request a hearing to fight the impoundment.

""I'm thinking that I'm just going to go and give a statement, show proof that my car wasn't in my possession, and everything will be okay, but in fact it turned into a nightmare,"" she says. ""I felt like I was pretty much in The Twilight Zone.""

The Twilight Zone is Room 110 in Chicago's administrative hearings building, a small courtroom where the city churns through its impound cases at a rate of roughly one every 10-15 minutes, five days a week.

Because the hearings are civil matters, not criminal, there is no right to a lawyer, and Walker-Davis found herself standing across from a lawyer for the city of Chicago. She tried to explain to the administrative hearing judge what had happened, but it made no difference. She was found liable for violating the city code and would have to pay nearly $2,500 to get their car out of impound.

""I felt like crap,"" she says. ""I felt like a criminal.""

In late March of this year, The couple managed to find a pro bono lawyer and negotiate their fine down to $1,170, but when they arrived with cash in hand, they were told the registration on their car had lapsed in the more than six months it had been sitting in an impound lot, and the city would not release it without a current registration.

Walker-Davis rushed the next day to get their registration renewed, which cost another $101, and got the city to agree to extend the deadline for the couple to pay their impound fines. In an email provided to Reason, a lawyer for Chicago's law department wrote to the couple: ""The City will agree to extend the time for you to pay the settlement agreement to 4/12/19.""

But when the couple showed up to retrieve their car on April 10, it was gone. The city had already sold it off. According to WBEZ, Chicago sells many of the cars it impounds for paltry amounts under $200, and almost all of them are sold to a single towing contractor.

The Institute for Justice is hoping that a recent Supreme Court case will bolster their claim that Chicago's rapacious impound program fines people so much and affords them so few avenues of escape that it violates the Constitution.

The Supreme Court ruled earlier this year in Timbs v. Indiana—the case of an Indiana man whose $42,000 Land Rover was seized for a drug felony—that states are bound by the Eighth Amendment's protections against excessive fines and fees. Although the Court did not define exactly what constitutes ""excessive,"" it opened the door for civil liberties groups to press the issue.

In 2017, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down Los Angeles' automatic 30-day impound law, ruling that it amounted to an unconstitutional seizure under the Fourth Amendment. While state and federal courts have repeatedly upheld Chicago's impound program in the past, the Institute for Justice hopes that it can build on the recent Supreme Court decision, as well as other cases that have addressed the government's use of fines and fees to generate revenue.

""We think we've got a really great chance, and we think the courts will agree with us that the system is just too much,"" Simpson says. ""It's bringing in an entirely huge amount of money for the city of Chicago—there's about 22,000 cars that go in through this system each year—and that's not the role of the government.""",Chicago Impounds Innocent People’s Cars and Soaks Them in Fines.

Not so long ago Wolverhampton Wanderers were dealing with the dreaded double-drop down to League One, but wholesale changes have got this former giant competing again.

Seventh in the Premier League and already a feared opponent for the big-boys above them, there’s every chance that Nuno Espirito Santo 's troops can be the Burnley of 2019.

Last season it was the Clarets who finished in this position and scraped into the Europa League as a result of Manchester City and Chelsea winning the cup competitions as well as finishing in the top six.

It would be an amazing achievement if Wolves were to do it during their first season back in the top-flight - and even more impressive as the Molineux men have done it in style.

But can they keep up with the pace - and even then, will it be enough?

Finishing seventh and hoping that a top-six club win the FA Cup is the most likely way Wolves will get there.

With Manchester United playing Chelsea in the next round of the prestigious competition, there will only be two of the current top six left in the quarter-finals providing City don’t slip up against Newport or Middlesbrough.

So the chance of an outsider causing a shock is still on.

That outsider could well be Wolves. They’ve already beaten Liverpool and taken points off every other top-six opponent in the Premier League so why can’t they go all the way in the competition?

A win would see them enter at a much later stage in the Europa League, too.

Another potential route in is to jump ahead of stuttering Arsenal into sixth.

Wolves are currently nine points behind the Gunners and still have to entertain Unai Emery’s men in March.

It’s an unlikely outcome, but stranger things have happened.

Football reporter Ben Husband discusses the possibility of the a European tour in the video above.

Will the added Europa League fixtures stretch Wolves’ resources too far?’ Ben asks.

Do Wolves just take it as a special season or go one step further with this amazing adventure?

Watch the video above for his full thoughts.

We asked fans whether Wolves were ready for European football.

Here are some of the replies:

Paul Smith: “Not now, but if we qualify. Fosun and Nuno will get the right players in over the summer to make sure we are ready next season.”

@Dwarfio: “I thought the only way I’d see #wwfc in Europe was if they brought the Anglo Italian Cup back. Could we, just maybe.”

@ranabainsrocke1: “Everton away what a day , Europe in sights now. Class performance up the wolves #wwfc”

@alan_wolves: “Between now and end of season we will pick up more points than LFC. Congrats to MCFC for another league win. Anfield last game of season we qualify for Europe. #lfc #mcfc #wwfc.”

Former Wolverhampton Wanderers skipper Paul Ince has backed his old club to gatecrash the Premier League's top six, this season.

He was speaking after Nuno Espirito Santo's squad easily dismissed Everton at Goodison Park.

Wolves went into their clash with the Toffees knowing a win would put them clear in the race to be 'best of the rest'.

In reality it was hardly a contest as Wolves swept aside a sorry Everton side.

Speaking on BT Sport's Score show, Ince said: “I’m going to put my neck out here. They could get sixth, they are on 38 points.

“I’m not sure who will drop out, all I’m saying is they are on 38 points, they’ve competed and beat most of the top six.

“Who’s to say they couldn’t finish sixth in the table?”

599033,thedailycaller,"If you’ve paid for any healthcare expenses in the years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, you know that the cost of paying for healthcare expenses continues to rise, leaving many Americans searching for a more affordable way. One solution that is often discovered during this search is known as healthcare sharing.

You may be asking “How have I not heard of healthcare sharing? Is this a new thing?” While you may not have heard of it, it is certainly not a new thing.

Healthcare sharing ministries have existed in their current state since the Reagan administration, and they present an affordable method of paying for medical expenses that allows members the freedom to choose healthcare that aligns with their personal moral values. Though each healthcare sharing ministry varies in the way it facilitates the payment of medical expenses, the general theory remains the same: healthcare sharing ministry members directly share each other’s medical expenses. The monthly share amount paid by each member also varies by ministry, but as a reference point, one of the largest healthcare sharing ministries, Liberty HealthShare, has monthly share amounts as low as $199 for individuals and $429 for families.

Think of everything you could do with all of that extra money!

When presented with the idea of such an affordable solution to pay for health care costs, many families think this is simply too good to be true. However, with membership in healthcare sharing ministries on the rise, it’s apparent that these ministries are operating quite effectively. Liberty HealthShare, which shares the same non-profit status as every other healthcare sharing ministry, paid out over $55 million dollars in medical bills during 2016 according to the annual audit posted on its website. These expenses were paid solely from contributions by members, and the remaining funds were carried over into the next year to safeguard against a spike in members’ medical expenses. Through this facilitation of members’ funds, healthcare sharing ministries such as Liberty HealthShare are providing their members with the opportunity to change the way they pay for healthcare.

Honestly, isn’t it refreshing to see an organization manage money so efficiently?

If you still need more evidence that healthcare sharing ministries are not “too good to be true,” look no further than the sheer volume of people who take personal responsibility for their medical costs by using healthcare sharing ministries. As of the end of 2017, membership in healthcare sharing ministries surpassed the one million mark, which is more than five times as many members than in 2012 when the number was around 175,000. The drastically increased popularity of healthcare sharing ministries can be partly attributed to the exemption members receive from the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate. Thanks to the religious exemption that healthcare sharing ministries received prior to 1999, members of these ministries are not required to pay a tax penalty for not being a member of an ACA-approved plan.

Preventing government interference in healthcare? It’s no wonder so many Americans have joined the movement!

It’s a common misconception that healthcare sharing ministries keep prices low by not sharing expensive medical bills, such as hospital stays, emergency room visits, and ambulance transportation. However, these expenses, and any other expense classified as medically necessary, such as doctor visits, vaccinations, chiropractic services, hospice care, and alternative care are all shareable expenses according to Liberty HealthShare’s sharing guidelines. In addition to these eligible expenses, Liberty HealthShare and a number of other healthcare sharing ministries offer member discounts on prescriptions, dental, and vision services.

As Americans search for an affordable way to pay for their healthcare, healthcare sharing ministries look poised to continue their growth. More and more people are starting to realize that these ministries are not “too good to be true,” and they actually do provide Americans with an affordable solution to pay for medical expenses. These ministries are subject to annual financial audits and have proven over and over again to have a good track record of paying eligible expenses. With this independent audit validating the effectiveness of these ministries, those who want to control healthcare costs for themselves and their families may want to consider a healthcare sharing ministry as a top option.",A Solution to Lower Healthcare Costs,health,healthcare policy,693
635548,thedailymirror,"It was 54 years ago that the death penalty was abolished in Britain, after public opinion turned against the ultimate form of punishment, fearing that innocent people were being sent to the gallows.

Among the cases which swung feelings was that of Derek Bentley, who was hanged for the murder of a policeman - but won a posthumous pardon in 1998, 45 years after he was hanged in 1953.

But there could now be another case to be added to the list of Brits who were executed for crimes they didn't commit.

On May 26, 1938, Robert Hoolhouse was hanged on the scaffold in Durham after being found guilty of the rape and murder of a farmer’s wife.

The labourer, who had just turned 21, died protesting his innocence right up until his last breath.

Now, however, historians who have reexamined his case have concluded that Robert’s conviction was just as dubious as others who faced the hangman’s noose and were later declared innocent.

And many now believe his death was yet another miscarriage of justice which proves that the death penalty should never be allowed to return in the UK.

It was on January 18, 1938 that the village of Wolviston, Stockton-on-Tees, was shocked by the discovery of the body of Margaret Dobson, on a cart track leading to her home at High Grange Farm.

The 67-year-old wife of farmer Henry had been raped and then “severely battered” before being stabbed twice - once in the chest and once in the neck.

The murder gripped the community, with women so scared of the vicious murdered they would not leave their homes alone and children were kept indoors.

Mr Dobson had last seen her wife and mother of their three children earlier that day when they had shared a tea of beef sandwiches at around 3pm.

She then left the house to visit her sister in Hartlepool, walking along the cart track through field to the main road to catch her bus.

She was known to wear old boots on the muddy track and then change into a smarter pair of shoes before boarding.

But on this day Mrs Dobson never made it to the main road.

When she hadn’t returned that evening, Mr Dobson waited at the bus stop until the final bus had passed by at 11pm, then walked home and had a sleepless night.

The next morning he found his wife’s body dumped in one of his fields.

The North Eastern Gazette reported: ""In the morning the animals had to be fed and work had to be done,"" reported the North Eastern Gazette.

""He started his work at about 5am. Somewhere between 7am and 8am men arrived to thrash his corn.

""At about 10am, after completing his work, he set out to make inquiries.

""He took a short cut to Wolviston through some fields. Something prompted him to look back.

""He saw something on the ground he could not understand and found the body of his wife lying on her back with head towards the farm and her feet toward the main road.""

An autopsy found that the mum-of-three died within an hour and a half of eating her tea.

As police swarmed into Wolviston and the brutal murder made newspaper front pages, Durham County Constabulary released a statement saying they wanted to speak to a man aged around 30 with the appearance of a farm worker and had been seen on a bike in the area.

The next day 20-year-old Robert William Hoolhouse was arrested and charged with Mrs Dobson’s murder.

The police had based their belief that he was the murderer on an incident that had happened three years earlier, when the Hoolhouse family had been working on the Dobsons’ farm and lived in a cottage on the land.

But following an argument Mr Dobson sacked them and thew them off the land, warning them never to return.

At the time of his arrest, police also noted marks on Robert’s face which he blamed on “a spill he had with his bicycle”, while he blamed blood on the cuffs of his shirt on a shaving cut.

His trial later heard that the scratches could have be caused as Mrs Dobson tried to defend herself.

Police also claimed the timings of Robert’s alibis on the day the farmer’s wife died didn’t tally with the statements given by people he said he had been with.

However, other evidence and the statements of other witnesses which later emerged throw more than a little doubt on his guilt.

One, Margaret Barker, said she had travelled on the same bus as Robert had taken to go to the pictures at 6pm on January 18, which would have been after Mrs Dobson had been murdered.

But she said she hadn’t noticed any scratches to his face.

Perhaps even more importantly, when Margaret had been found she was still wearing heavy wooden gloves.

The police had experimented with these gloves, trying to cause similar scratches on a volunteer's face. A secretary with long nails was unable to inflict the slightest wound.

The other witness was Doris Teale, who lived next to the Hoolhouses, and said she had seen Robert standing outside his house at the time he was supposed to be murdering Mrs Dobson.

Even more conclusive was the footprint evidence. Henry Dobson had stepped around the body and his prints were clearly seen.

Other prints, presumably from the killer, were underneath Henry's. Plaster casts of those prints had been made, but they did not match any of Robert’s footwear.

And the description of a man seen at the farm at around 5pm on the night of the murder was also at odds with the young labourer’s appearance and the clothes he had been wearing that day.

Finally, there was the fact that no semen stains were found on Robert’s clothing, despite extensive stains being found on Margaret’s.

Despite the cast contradictory evidence, though, police were convinced they had the right man.

At his trial at Leeds Assizes Court, prosecutor Mr Paley-Scott KC described the brutality of the crime.

He said: ""You will hear that whoever it was who had attacked her had battered with his fists into insensibility or, at any rate, into a state in which she, a woman 67 years of age, was no longer able to resist and had then ravished her and, one would suppose, had then decided to kill the only witness of his deed.""

Robert was found guilty by a jury after four hours and sentenced to death.

Following the conviction an appeal was launched back with a petition of 14,000 signatures, but the last-ditch attempt to save him was rejected.

Protesting his innocent to the end, Robert was hanged at Durham by famous executioner Thomas Pierrepoint.

Years later, his father reportedly made a deathbed confession that it was he who was responsible for Mrs Dobson’s murder.

But he was not seen around the murder scene and it was thought he was making an attempt to posthumously clear his son.",Evidence which 'proves' labourer hanged for murder 81 years ago was innocent,"crime, law and justice",justice,1129
60448,birminghammail,"Speedboat killer Jack Shepherd has touched down in London after 10 months on the run.

The 31-year-old told reporters on a Georgian Airways flight as he was extradited from Tbilisi that he acted on ""emotion and fear"" when he fled the UK and now wants to ""make amends"".

He arrived at London Gatwick on Wednesday evening and will appear at the Old Bailey in the morning, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.

Angela Deal, head of extradition at the CPS said: ""Jack Shepherd has returned to the UK to face justice following close co-operation between the CPS extradition unit, UK colleagues and the Georgian authorities, to ensure a successful extradition.

""He will first appear at the Old Bailey to be sentenced for the gross negligence manslaughter conviction in connection with the death of Charlotte Brown, and then at a later date in the South West over the grievous bodily harm charge.""

Pictures released by the Special Penitentiary Service of Georgia earlier on Wednesday showed a handcuffed Shepherd being led by two uniformed officers into a secure cell in the back of a van.

He was believed to have been transferred to Metropolitan Police officers at Tbilisi International Airport and boarded a plane to Gatwick.

He was sentenced in his absence last year to six years in prison over the death of 24-year-old Charlotte Brown.

She died after the pair went for a late-night speedboat ride down the River Thames in December 2015.

Shepherd told reporters on the plane that he and his family have received threats as a result of ""misplaced"" animosity caused by the media's misreporting of certain aspects of the case.

Wearing an open-collared shirt, Shepherd said: ""There really have been some complete untruths, in particular this idea that I let her drown, that I did nothing to help her, this could not be further from the truth.""

Asked why he did not stay to defend himself in court, he said: ""I wasn't thinking at the time, I was acting on emotion and fear and I made a mistake.

""But now I'm trying to make amends.""

Shepherd added that he regretted not speaking to Ms Brown's family sooner, calling it his ""second biggest mistake"" after taking out the boat that night.

A jury found Shepherd guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence in his absence after he skipped bail last summer.

The web designer's trial heard that he had been drinking champagne on a first date with Ms Brown when they went on the speedboat ride.

His 14ft Fletcher Arrowflyte boat had a series of defects and was speeding when it overturned near Wandsworth Bridge, throwing Ms Brown to her death in the water.

Shepherd, originally from Exeter, was plucked from the cold river.

He made his last appearance before the Old Bailey in November 2017 to deny manslaughter.

It was at the start of his trial last June that it emerged he would not attend court but he remained in regular contact with his defence team who pushed on without him.

The jury found him guilty and Judge Richard Marks QC sentenced him in absentia.

Shepherd told reporters he now felt ""ready to face"" prison and had ""come to terms"" with spending time behind bars.

He added that he felt responsible for Ms Brown's death ""in part"" but ""not to the degree of manslaughter"".

Shepherd will be returned before the judge from 9.30am on Thursday for the execution of a bench warrant. Then his prison sentence awaits.

He could also face extra jail time for absconding but it is not yet known when a judge may add to his sentence.

Shepherd was granted permission to appeal against the conviction in December and surrendered to authorities in Tbilisi the following month.

The family of Ms Brown, from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, had publicly campaigned for Shepherd to hand himself in.

Her father Graham Brown told ITV after Shepherd agreed to extradition last month that he had a weak case and ""no choice"" but to return.

32823,bbc,"Rugby player Israel Folau has drawn anger for linking Australia's bushfire crisis to the nation's same-sex marriage and abortion laws.

Folau, who was sacked by Australia in May for making anti-gay remarks on social media, described the fires as a ""little taste of God's judgement"".

Six people have died since last month in blazes raging in eastern Australia.

""He is a free citizen, he can say whatever he likes but that doesn't mean he can't have regard to the grievance [and] offence this would have caused to the people whose homes have burnt down,"" Mr Morrison told reporters on Monday.
• Heatwave is forecast to spark new Australia fires
• Is climate change to blame for Australia's fires?

Folau, who is Christian, gave a sermon in his Sydney church on Sunday in which he said Australia's decision to pass abortion and same-sex marriage laws had gone against ""God's word"", adding the nation needed to ""repent"".

""Look how rapid, these bushfires, these droughts, all these things have come, in a short period of time. You think it's a coincidence or not?,"" he said.

His comments sparked outrage from many Australians online, who noted the widespread devastation of the fires.

He was also criticised by high-profile local figures who had previously supported him.

""Israel, button up,"" said broadcaster Alan Jones on his radio show on Monday. ""These comments don't help.""

Rugby Australia (RA) sacked the former Wallabies player in May after he said on social media that ""hell awaits"" gay people.

The 30-year-old fullback has been widely condemned for those comments and others targeting transgender people, but he has also received vocal support from Christian groups.

The retired rugby player - who signed for MMA promotion Bellator in August - is looking to become King of the Jungle after signing on to appear in the hit ITV show.

The 34-year-old amassed 77 England caps during his 17-year rugby career, featuring in two World Cups.

Haskell - who announced his retirement from rugby earlier this year - was even named ""man of the series"" during England’s famous 3-0 series victory against Australia in 2016.

And now the ex-Wasps star is pursuing a new sport, with his first MMA fight inside the Octagon expected to take place during the first half of 2020.

The heavyweight has got his fitness regime and nutrition down to a fine art, but that doesn't mean the celeb has always had abs of steel.

Over the years, Haskell has consistently shown his ability to cut weight and transform the look of his body.

In his own words, Haskell went from a ‘melted wheelie bin’ to being in fine shape by following his own 12-week Lean Gains programme in 2016.

He suffered a toe injury which kept him out of action, during which time he ballooned to 19st.

At the time he said: ""The idea is to come back fitter, more mobile and powerful.

""I have enjoyed my down time and allowed myself to put on weight and sadly not good weight at that.""

Over the next nine weeks he shed the excess weight and turned his body into a vision of ripped muscles.

The Lean Gains programme uses German Volume Training (GVT), a system for bodybuilders, powerlifters and Olympic lifters to increase muscle, mass and strength.

It also involves Hypertrophy-Specific Training (HST), a method of strength training to induce muscle growth quickly and effectively.

On his YouTube channel, the sportsman demonstrates his other workout routines to shift the extra pounds.

He showcases a plethora of workout ideas including blast workouts, cross fit and HIIT (high-intensity interval training).

The athlete combines a mixture of workout routines to maximise endurance, strength and agility.

Combining strength and cardio work also allows Haskell to accelerate calorie burning whilst maintaining muscle mass.

To refine his MMA skills, Haskell trains at London Shootfighters in Wembley, the same training facility as Bellator superstar, Michael 'Venom' Page.

There the former Northampton Saints ace trains with a mixture of MMA pros including Sam Showering, who also switched to fighting after retiring from rugby.

Haskell maintains a peak fitness regime outside the gym too, with his wife Chloe Madeley on hand to prepare meals.

His 6ft 4 in, 18.5 stone frame is sustained with six meals a day - totalling a whopping 3560 calories.

To maximise performance, Haskell gets through six-to-eight litres of waters per day while also consuming 310g of protein daily.

Like most of us, the 34-year old loves junk food, but he eats rice cakes and nut butter to curb any cravings.

With Haskell now in the Australian jungle, he will have to adjust to a new physical challenge in the form of bushtucker trials and surviving on just 700 calories a day.",I’m A Celebrity star James Haskell’s body transformation comes from extreme training regimes and diets,sport,bodybuilding,505

It’s a very big transaction and we’ve agreed in principle” Trump said at a press conference where he was seated beside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. “It’s billions and billions of dollars.”

Trump said that the deal would open Japan to additional U.S. agricultural exports. In particular, Trump said Japan had agreed to buy surplus corn from U.S. farmers.

Trump said he expected the two leaders would sign a deal next month.

U.S. auto tariffs, which Japan has been asking to be reduced, will stay in place. But the deal rules out those tariffs going even higher. And U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said other tariffs would be cut.

Oil slipped in early Asian trade on Friday, with U.S. crude moving further away from a two-month high after OPEC agreed to increase output curbs in early 2020 but failed to promise further steps after March.

Brent futures LCOc1 were down 21 cents, or 0.3%, at $63.18 by 0258 GMT, Reuters said.

West Texas Intermediate oil futures CLc1 fell 14 cents, or 0.2%, to $58.29 a barrel. They hit $59.12 a barrel on Thursday, the highest since the end of September.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies including Russia - a grouping known as OPEC+ - agreed to more output cuts to avert oversupply early next year as economic growth stagnates amid the U.S.-China trade war.

The agreement, which needs to be formally adopted later on Friday, will cut an extra 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of production, through tighter compliance and some adjustments. The group has been withholding 1.2 million bpd and the increased amount represents about 1.7% of global oil output.

The ""decision seems to be more of a housekeeping move that will narrow the gap between their current target and the over-compliance we have seen from the alliance,"" said Edward Moya senior market analyst at OANDA.

A panel of ministers representing OPEC and non-OPEC producers led by Russia recommended the cuts, according to Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak on Thursday.

Details need to be hammered out at an OPEC+ meeting that starts later on Friday in Vienna.

 Rune Andersen, head of the doping task force for the world governing body for track and field, said on March 11 that two “outstanding issues” need to be resolved for Russia to be reinstated.

 

 Speaking after a council meeting of top officials in Qatar, Andersen said that the ban will remain in place until analytical data and samples collected from Moscow's former anti-doping laboratory earlier this year are made available.

 

 ""Logistical"" issues have also held up financial compensation, including for the task force's costs, he said.

 Another report a year later documented more than 1,000 doping cases across dozens of sports, most notably at the Winter Olympics that Russia hosted in the Black Sea resort of Sochi in 2014.

74405,breitbart,"A new cancer vaccine has given researchers hope after it removed cancer cells in a patient with breast cancer.

Dr. Saranya Chumsri, an oncologist at the Mayo Clinic, said the vaccine is “supposed to stimulate a patient’s own immune response so that the immune cells like t-cells would go in and attack the cancer.”

In March, Florida resident Lee Mercker was diagnosed with the early stages of “DCIS stage zero” breast cancer, which meant the disease had not spread.

“I’m an exercise fanatic, I eat right. But it just can knock on anybody’s door,” said Mercker, who was the first person to participate in the clinical trial.

She said doctors performed a series of checks before administering the vaccine during the 12-week trial at the clinic in Jacksonville.

“They always took your blood, you had a physical, they’d make your shot right there on the spot for you,” she said. “It was three shots, all in a row, alternating arms, four shots, two weeks apart.”

Chumsri stated the vaccine is designed to mirror other routine shots. “It’s supposed to be just off the shelf, kind of similar to when you get the flu shot or pneumonia shot,” the oncologist noted.

However, as a part of the trial, Mercker was required to have a mastectomy.

“That is the only way we know that everything was removed properly,” Chumsri said.

In April, researchers began working on another cancer vaccine that is said to harness the power of the immune system to destroy cancer cells by injecting the medicine directly into the tumor.

“We’re injecting two immune stimulants right into one single tumor,” said Dr. Joshua Brody, director of the Lymphoma Immunotherapy Program at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. “We inject one tumor and we see all of the other tumors just melt away.”

Reports said that eight out of eleven lymphoma patients who participated in a clinical trial of the vaccine experienced partial or complete destruction of the tumor.

687001,theguardianuk,"The 2016 Olympic marathon champion Jemima Sumgong has had her doping ban increased to eight years after her claims that she was injected with EPO by an “imposter” at a Kenyan hospital during a doctor’s strike were dismissed.

The unprecedented sanction was made after the IAAF’s independent disciplinary tribunal ruled there was “compelling evidence” Sumgong had also fabricated her medical records and lied about her whereabouts after a positive test for EPO in 2017, for which she later received a four-year ban.

That ban was doubled by the IAAF on Friday after the tribunal, chaired by Michael Beloff QC, decided Sumgong had committed a second anti-doping offence of “tampering with a doping control”. Because of changes to the World Anti-Doping Agency code the Kenyan was able to be punished with another four-year ban.

The ruling means Sumgong, who was the first Kenyan woman to win Olympic marathon gold, is banned until 3 April 2025.

The news was welcomed by Brett Clothier, the head of the Athletics Integrity Unit, who said it struck a blow against doping in Kenyan. “We hope that it sends a message to dopers that the AIU has strong investigative capabilities and does not tolerate false evidence in doping cases,” he said.

“We also want to underline the vital support of Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya in pursuing this case. They are a valuable partner in the fight against doping in Kenya.”

The remarkable case began when Sumgong tested positive for EPO in April 2017 – and then tried to explain it away by saying she had suffered a ruptured ectopic pregnancy on the 22-23 February 2017 which had led to an injection and a blood transfusion at a Nairobi hospital.

Shortly afterwards Sumgong, who had previously suffered an ectopic pregnancy in 2009, also provided anti-doping officials with five fabricated hospital documents to support her case.

However the Kenyan hospital confirmed she had not visited the hospital in February 2017, said her documents were fake because they lacked a unique hospital number, and insisted that such a serious problem as a ruptured ectopic pregnancy would have required a four-day stay at an acute gynaecology ward.

Sumgong later claimed she had been treated by an “imposter” because there had been a doctor’s strike which explained the lack of a proper record of her visit. However she was unable to explain how Wada’s whereabouts records showed she was in Kapsabet – a five-hour drive away – at the time.

In explaining his verdict, Beloff said he found “compelling evidence demonstrating the athlete submitted false medical documents to an anti-doping organisation and to the tribunal”.

“[It] can only be analysed as a deliberate attempt to prevent the administration of justice in her case,” he said. “Perjury and forgery inevitably go beyond the bounds of legitimate defence under any civilised system of law.”

Beloff also noted that Sumgong had also failed to provide evidence she had travelled to Nairobi in late February. “To put the matter colloquially she couldn’t be in two places at once,” he wrote.",Marathon champion Jemima Sumgong has doping ban doubled to eight years,sport,drug use in sport,493

Much of the UK will be sunny tomorrow with relatively light winds, bringing temperatures of low 20s for most of England and Wales but high teens for Northern Ireland and Scotland.

However, a band of cloud and rain coming from the south will creep in on Thursday, drenching the Channel Islands and the southern counties with showers.

Forecasters said it was a sign of ""things to come"" as the cloud is linked to an area of low pressure that is connected to wet and ""unseasonably windy weather"".

It will move in Thursday night and through Friday with the Met Office issuing weather warnings.

Met Office spokesman Oliver Claydon said: ""This unseasonable weather is due to an area of particularly low pressure from the Atlantic.

""Thursday evening is when it will hit and then it will move northeastwards from Friday through Saturday, reaching Scotland and northeast England Friday evening.

""There are two parts to this weather front which is the high winds and also thundery showers.""

The Met Office said the weather front is the kind that is normally expected in autumn and winter.

They added: ""It is very unusual for wind to be this strong at this time of year. Especially with trees in full leaf, it means it could impact more.

""Winds will reach 40mph inland but the southeast coast, and around Bristol could see winds of 50mph.

""But London, despite being in the southeast, can expect winds of 40mph.""

Gale force winds could be so extreme this weekend that it has led to organisers of the Boardmasters music festival to cancel the event just hours before it was due to open.

The decision was based on advice from the police and independent safety advisers.

The US Department of Justice inspector general's report concluded the law enforcement bureau had ""authorised purpose"" to initiate the investigation.

But it also found applications to wiretap a Trump aide had ""significant inaccuracies and omissions"".

The 476-page report provides fodder for Trump critics and supporters alike.

Inspector General Michael Horowitz sought to assess the basis for the FBI's surveillance of Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser who had lived and worked in Russia.

How did the report criticise the FBI?

The inspector general identified 17 ""significant inaccuracies or omissions"" when the FBI applied to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (Fisa) for surveillance warrants to monitor Mr Page's communications.

Mr Horowitz wrote that the errors resulted in ""applications that made it appear that the information supporting probable cause was stronger than was actually the case"".

The watchdog also found that an FBI lawyer assigned to the Russia case doctored an email from the CIA to a colleague that was used in an application from the bureau to monitor Mr Page.

The attorney ""altered an email that the other US government agency had sent"" with the effect that ""the email inaccurately stated that Page was 'not a source' for the other agency"", the report said.

The watchdog also found FBI personnel ""fell far short of the requirement in FBI policy that they ensure that all factual statements in a Fisa application are 'scrupulously accurate'"".

The report said ""so many basic and fundamental errors... raised significant questions regarding the FBI chain of command's management and supervision of the Fisa process"".

How did the report back the FBI?

The inspector general found no basis for conservative claims that partisan hostility to Mr Trump had influenced the bureau's probe.

""We did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced the decisions to open the four individual investigations,"" he said.

Mr Horowitz also did not find that the FBI's mistakes were intentional.

The investigation was opened ""in compliance with department and FBI policies"", the report said.

Mr Horowitz also found the FBI's use of confidential informants was in compliance with agency rules.

What about the 'Steele dossier'?

The watchdog faulted how the FBI presented the work of former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele, who authored the so-called Steele dossier - a series of largely unsubstantiated allegations about Mr Trump.

Mr Steele was hired to do the research through a law firm on behalf of Mr Trump's political opponents, including Hillary Clinton's campaign.

Mr Horowitz said the FBI ""overstated the significance"" of Mr Steele's past work.

The watchdog also said the FBI left out relevant information about one of Mr Steele's sources, whom Mr Steele himself had called a ""boaster"" prone to ""embellishment"".

The report noted that the CIA itself viewed the Steele dossier as little more than ""an internet rumour"".

But the watchdog said ex-FBI Director James Comey and his former deputy, Andrew McCabe, argued the Steele dossier should not be dismissed.

While Mr Trump has often spoken of a so-called deep state plot to undermine his presidency, Monday's watchdog report also makes clear some FBI employees celebrated his victory over Hillary Clinton.

One FBI agent said in an instant message he ""was so elated with the election"" and likened the coverage to ""watching a Super Bowl comeback"".

Another agent sent a message on the morning after the election saying: ""Trump!"" His colleague replied: ""Hahaha."" ""LOL,"" the agent responded.

Mr Trump has often cited messages previously uncovered by Mr Horowitz that were sent on work phones between two FBI employees, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.

The messages expressed ""statements of hostility toward then-candidate Trump"", the watchdog notes.

But the watchdog found no evidence that Mr Strzok or Ms Page's investigative actions were influenced by their own political opinions.

Agents at the bureau are supposed to be apolitical, but they are now at the centre of a ferocious row. For those at the FBI, it's a nightmare.

The ""G-men"", as the government men were known in the 1930s, were once portrayed as good guys in Hollywood.

Overall FBI agents are more white, male and conservative than the general population in the US, and they were known in the past for their aggressive campaign against communists.

But now Trump has cast them as ""Deep Staters"", bureaucrats who seek to undermine his presidency because of supposed Democratic leanings.

However much the G-men might prefer to stay above the fray, they've been sucked into the biggest drama in town: the Trump Show.

Speaking at the White House on Monday, President Donald Trump said of the report's findings: ""It's a disgrace what's happened.""

""This was an attempted overthrow and a lot of people were in on it, and they got caught,"" he added.

US Attorney General William Barr rejected the inspector general's main conclusion that there was enough evidence for the FBI to launch its investigation of the Trump campaign.

America's top law official said the probe by the FBI, which he oversees, was launched ""on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken"".

John Durham, a federal prosecutor hand-picked by the attorney general to conduct a pending, separate criminal inquiry into the roots of the Russia investigation, said he did not agree with some of Mr Horowitz's conclusions.

Democrats said the report undercuts Mr Trump's repeated claims that he was the victim of a ""witch hunt"".

""It was never a witch hunt,"" Democratic Senator Mark Warner said on Twitter. ""It was the men and women of federal law enforcement doing their jobs.""

Mr Horowitz reviewed more than one million records and conducted over 170 interviews after launching his investigation in March last year.

He scrutinised the FBI's process for launching its 2016 inquiry, known as Operation Crossfire Hurricane, to look for any collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government before the US presidential election.

That FBI investigation was ultimately taken over by special counsel Robert Mueller.

Mr Mueller's own 22-month inquiry concluded in April this year there was not enough evidence to conclude the Trump campaign had conspired with the Kremlin to sway the 2016 US presidential election.",'No political bias' in FBI probe of Trump campaign,politics,political process,1002

The U.S. Census Bureau says a test for the 2020 census shows having a question about citizenship didn't have much of an impact on response rates for the general population, though responses by Hispanics were down slightly when the citizenship question was included on the questionnaire.

The Census Bureau sent out the test questionnaires in June to 480,000 addresses as part of an effort to fine-tune planning for the 2020 head count next spring.

Half of the questionnaires had a question asking for citizenship information. The other half didn't.

At the time, the bureau didn't know if the question would be allowed since it was being litigated between the Trump administration and civil rights groups.

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled this summer that the question couldn't be on the 2020 questionnaire.

A new report says the U.S. Census Bureau is on track to meet key deadlines ahead of next spring's massive head count, but the agency faces delays in building a temporary workforce that eventually could number as many as a half-million people.

The report released Thursday by the U.S. Government Accountability Office also says the bureau still has critical work to do in making sure its information technology systems are secure and tested for the 2020 census.

The GAO says hiring for early operations has been slowed because of delays in background checks and a higher than expected rate of people who were hired but then dropped out.

18624,aljazeera,"Five of the world's largest tech companies have been accused in a landmark lawsuit of being complicit in the deaths of children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) who were forced to mine cobalt, a metal used to make telephones and computers.

The legal complaint on behalf of 14 families from the DRC was filed on Sunday by International Rights Advocates, a United States-based human rights non-profit, against Tesla Inc, Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc, Dell Technologies Inc. and Microsoft Corp.
• DR Congo: Several hacked to death in suspected rebel attacks
• Is DR Congo on the brink?

The complaint said families claim that the companies were part of a system of forced labour that led to the serious injuries or deaths of the children.

This marked the first time that tech-industry companies have jointly faced legal action over the source of their cobalt.

Images in the court documents, filed in US District Court in Washington, DC, showed children with disfigured or missing limbs.

Six of the 14 children in the case were killed in tunnel collapses, and the others suffered life-altering injuries, including paralysis, the complaint said.

""These companies - the richest companies in the world, these fancy gadget-making companies - have allowed children to be maimed and killed to get their cheap cobalt,"" Terrence Collingsworth, a lawyer representing the families, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Cobalt is essential in making rechargeable lithium batteries used in millions of products sold by the tech industry.

More than half of the world's cobalt is produced in the DRC.

Global demand for the metal is expected to increase at seven percent to 13 percent annually over the next decade, according to a 2018 study by the European Commission.

The lawsuit said the children, some as young as six years old, were forced by their families' extreme poverty to leave school and work in cobalt mines owned by the British and Swiss mining company Glencore, which has previously been accused of using child labour.

Some children were paid as little as $1.50 per day for working six days a week, the complaint said.

In response to a request for comment, Dell said in an email that it has ""never knowingly sourced operations"" using child labour and has launched an investigation into the allegations.

A spokesperson for Glencore said: ""Glencore notes the allegations contained in a U.S. lawsuit filed on 15th December 2019.

""Glencore's production of cobalt in the DRC is a by-product of our industrial copper production. Glencore’s operations in the DRC do not purchase or process any artisanally mined ore.

""Glencore does not tolerate any form of child, forced, or compulsory labour.""

Tesla, Apple, Google, Microsoft did not immediately respond for comment.

The legal complaint argued that the companies all have the ability to overhaul their cobalt supply chains to ensure safer conditions.

""I've never encountered or documented a more severe asymmetry in the allocation of income between the top of the supply chain and the bottom,"" said Siddharth Kara, a researcher on modern slavery who is an expert witness in the case.

""It's that disconnect that makes this perhaps the worst injustice of slavery and child exploitation that I've seen in my two decades research,"" Kara said.

More than 40 million people have been estimated to be captive in modern slavery, which includes forced labour and forced marriage, according to Walk Free and the International Labour Organization.",US tech giants sued over DRC cobalt mine child labour deaths,labour,labour relations,546
714740,theguardianuk,"Record numbers of young adults in their 20s and 30s are living with their parents, according to official figures, with critics blaming soaring house prices and rents.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that over the last two decades, there has been a 46% increase in the number of young people aged 20-34 living with their parents. Over the same period, average house prices have tripled from about £97,000 to £288,000.

In total, 1.1 million more young men and women are now living at home, with the number increasing from 2.4 million in 1999 to 3.5 million in 2019.

Men are far more likely to be staying with their mum and dad into their 30s. The ONS said 32% of all males aged 20-34 are now living with their parents, compared with 26% in 1999, with most of the increase occurring since the financial crisis in 2007-08.

One in five women (21%) aged 20-34 live with their parents, although this is also a substantial increase from the 14% level of two decades ago.

Georgie Laming of campaign group Generation Rent said: “Young people are facing an impossible choice: either stay, if you’re lucky, living in your childhood bedroom in the hope you can save a deposit – or rent and face a struggle to put money aside. Two thirds of private renters have no savings whatsoever.”

In its review of trends in British households in 2019, the ONS noted that the other major change is the number of people living alone. Single person households have increased by a fifth over the last 20 years, largely driven by men aged 45-64.

A total of 8.2 million people now live alone, up from 6.8 million in 1999. The ONS said higher proportions of men than women never marry and that after partnership dissolution, men are more likely to live alone while women may live with any children from the relationship.

One of the key reasons why young adults stay at home for longer is to save for the much higher downpayments needed on their first home purchase.

In the mid 1990s, young adults typically put down a deposit of just 10%, and house prices in real terms were much lower. Now, the typical first-time buyer struggles to find the £25,000 deposit typically needed, with the average figure – heavily skewed by London prices – at nearly £45,000.

Liz Emerson, cofounder of the Intergenerational Foundation, said: “These figures provide yet further evidence that intergenerational unfairness is worsening. We should all be ashamed that our young people cannot strike out on their own like previous generations have been able to do.”

Quite why so many more men than women stay at home in their 20s and 30s is not entirely clear.

When the ONS issued a report earlier this year on the “Journey into adulthood”, it said: “There are a few possible reasons for this: women have traditionally moved in with a partner at younger ages than men; women are also more likely to go to university; and there is some evidence that, early in their careers at least, women have been known to earn more than men.”

For many parents, the “boomerang generation” of offspring returning from university presents its own challenges. Research by Loughborough University and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in January found that the average young adult in their 20s living at home saves £91 a week in rent, £16.50 in council tax and £12.80 in fuel bills.

But parents have to spend extra on food and heating, with the researchers suggesting that young adults should pay £100 a month for bed and board while at home.

The millions of young adults forced to stay at home or pay high rents could emerge as a key electoral battleground, with campaign groups demanding rent controls and targeting key marginal constituencies where renters could sway the result.

Generation Rent, working with other rental action groups, has identified 47 constituencies where the local MP’s majority is under 5,000 but where private tenants make up a higher than average proportion of voters.

Top of the demands in the campaigners’ national rental manifesto are new rent controls which would ban landlords from charging more than 30% of the local median income.

The tenants’ manifesto also demands an end to discrimination against tenants on housing benefit and the abolition of so-called “revenge” section 21 evictions (a section 21 notice is the form a landlord must give to a renter to start the process to end an assured shorthold tenancy).",Record numbers of young adults in UK living with parents,society,mankind,735

However, unless the Donbass crisis is ironed out in the near future, Kiev will be forced to implement ""new radical measures,"" the top Ukrainian diplomat said, citing the president’s formula.

The minister explained that Zelensky’s plan on ending the war in Donbass in the near future also implies a prisoner exchange.

105046,cnn,"The Illinois Legislature has sent Senate Bill 25, also called the Reproductive Health Act, to the governor's desk that would protect the ""fundamental rights of individuals to make autonomous decisions about one's own reproductive health."" The measure passed the Illinois Democratic-led Senate late Friday with a 34-20 vote. Only one Democrat voted against the bill, and Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker has said he will sign the legislation.

Under the bill, pregnant women have the ""fundamental right"" to have an abortion and a ""fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus does not have independent rights.""

It repeals the Illinois Abortion Law of 1975, which penalized doctors for performing the procedure, and the state's ban on partial-birth abortions. The bill also provides insurance requirements to cover abortion procedures.

Bush said there's a ""real possibility"" that in the coming years the Supreme Court could overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. Her bill, she said, ""guarantees that women in Illinois have the right to make decisions about their bodies, regardless of what happens at the federal level."" The bill will immediately take effect once the governor signs it into law. ""Today was a major step forward for every woman in this state and I look forward continuing my work as an ally by signing the Reproductive Healthcare Act into law,"" Pritzker wrote in tweet on Tuesday. In Nevada on Friday, Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak signed the ""Trust Nevada Women Act,"" Senate Bill 179, which removes long-standing criminal penalties for abortion and requirements for medical providers. ""Nevada has a long history of trusting the women of our state to make their own reproductive health care decisions and protecting the right to reproductive freedom,"" Sisolak said at the bill signing ceremony. The new law decriminalizes certain actions related to performing abortions, abortion drugs and abortion prosecution. It rewrites existing state abortion laws that require physicians to notify a pregnant woman about the ""emotional implications"" of an abortion, instead requiring doctors ""describe the nature and consequences of the procedure."" Physicians in the state would also no longer have to certify in writing a pregnant woman's marital status and age before performing an abortion as previous laws required. ""In light of increasing attacks at the federal level and in other states such as Georgia, Alabama, Missouri, and Louisiana, SB179 reaffirms Nevada's commitment to protecting reproductive freedom and access to reproductive health care,"" Sisolak said Friday. He continued, ""I have been disappointed by the recent uptick in efforts in other states to restrict women's right to choose, and I am especially proud today to be a Nevadan, where we protect a woman's right to make her own decisions about her own body.""

The first study to analyse the use of the drug in tackling booze addiction has shown it is both safe and highly effective, it has been reported.

In test cases where alcoholics have been given MDMA alongside psychotherapy, there has been only one relapse and no physical or psychological side effects, scientists say.

That compares to an overall figure where 80 per cent of patients undergoing traditional treatments are known to be drinking again within three years.

Dr Ben Sessa, the addiction psychiatrist leading the safety and tolerability at Imperial College London, said 11 people had so far completed the experimental treatment.

“We have five people who are completely dry and we have four or five who have had one or two drinks but wouldn’t reach the diagnosis of alcohol use disorder,” he told The Guardian.

Just one has completely relapsed, he confirmed.

Because most addiction is based on underlying trauma, often from childhood, “MDMA selectively impairs the fear response,” Dr Sessa added. “It allows recall of painful memories without being overwhelmed.”

He said: “MDMA psychotherapy gives you the opportunity to tackle rigidly held personal narratives that are based on early trauma. It’s the perfect drug for trauma-focused psychotherapy.”

The treatment itself sees patients given an eight-week course of therapy with powerful doses of MDMA administered in week three and six.

Discussing possible dangers associated with the drug, including the well-reported death of some recreational users, Dr Sessa said: “Scientists know it’s not dangerous. The Sun newspaper thinks it’s dangerous because the tiny number of fatalities that occur every year all get on their front page.”

He added: “If there was a craze of people going around abusing cancer chemotherapy drugs, you wouldn’t then think, ‘Oh well, it’s not safe to take cancer chemotherapy when doctors give it to you’.”

Further research, which compares the study’s results with a random control group who receive a placebo instead of MDMA, will now need to be carried out.","Treat alcoholism with MDMA, study suggests",society,social problem,323

From the bride sharing a whisper with her father before going down the aisle, or the shy flower girl kidnapping some canapes, we want to make sure these special moments, and the incredible wedding photographers that capture them, are celebrated.

This year, once again, Bridebook challenged hundreds of Bridebook’s best wedding photographers to send us their most unique, funny, tender and outrageous wedding photos from their 2018 weddings, so we could share those magical moments for all to enjoy.

So without further ado, here are our favourite wedding photos of 2018.

How many times do you get an opportunity to take a picture of the bride on a roller coaster? This was one of the most exciting moments in this photographer’s career (we just wonder how he did it…).

This bride and groom snuck into a telephone box at the Avoncroft Museum of Historic Buildings, where they tied the knot.

The photographer caught these lads having a laugh and a beer in the bathtub! They got ready in a jiffy and had plenty of time to relax before the wedding.

Pit stop! That’s what bridesmaids are for, no?

This photo was taken just as this little girl’s mother (the bride), stepped out of the room in her wedding dress. Her expression says it all.

The best man had just told a rather risqué story about the groom and the range of reactions at his punchline are incredible.

Yawns and bubbles. This baby’s nap-time wasn’t going to stop her dad from toasting the bride and groom.

The couple’s gorgeous dog was brought along to the wedding and had some big kisses for dad.

This newborn baby was just a couple of weeks old, and when the mum brought her to show the bride, everyone in the room wanted to take turns holding her. We love the blissed out expression on her face.

This photographer got the wedding guests involved with their phones during the reception to make this original photo.

This bride wanted their dog in the picture as they signed the papers. The photographer got the perfect angle.

Photographers often crack jokes to keep family photos fun and energetic. This granny said she had something to make everyone laugh, and with a serious face, flashed the photographer.

A lovely moment is captured as the bride and groom dance. If only everyone could look that majestic during their first dance.

The bride and groom didn’t want to do a traditional first dance, so they taught themselves to dance to ‘Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger’ by Daft Punk.

These ushers got creative when asked to move the floral arrangements from the church up to the marquee.

During the cake cutting, the groom noticed a bottle of Champagne on the table and immediately grabbed it. His wife said no… but it was far too late.

A tender moment between the groom and his bride during his speech.

One of the most beautiful photos on the list. We love how the photographer capture this fairytale moment.

The TV personality, who won the competition in 2016, said baking and group therapy has helped her, adding that she also takes medication.

Speaking on the Open Mind podcast, she told ex The Saturdays singer Frankie Bridge that while she was initially ""reluctant"" to accept the prescription, she has been taking ""various"" drugs for five years.

The 34-year-old explained: ""I suffer with clinical depression, chronic phobia and PTSD.

""It's hard and people don't realise, it's a real battle. People might be like, 'Oh she's jumping on the bandwagon,' but they've got no idea what has been going on in my brain for the past five or six years.

""It's been s**t, sometimes I get angry and it's probably going to be with me forever. When it got really bad, baking was what I would do.

""I'm on medication, I have been for five years, various different ones.""

The famous baker admitted she was initially angry that she would have to ""rely"" on medication, but now accepts she has a ""chemical imbalance.""

“Group therapy taught me that bouts of depression will probably be a reoccurring thing,"" she said. ""It p****d me off that I would have to rely on things. Now I know it’s not my fault.""

The former PE teacher added that she has struggled to go to work on particularly difficult days and said she has experienced ""not very nice thoughts of how I could get out of it.""

She said: ""At its worse I was being dragged out of bed by my feet and the duvet being shut in the bathroom, so there was nothing on the bed, so I had to get up. Those were the really bad days.""

In a furious rant on beIN Sports, Gray let rip in a conversation with Richard Keys after the game.

He blasted: ""Craig Pawson is miles away, and he isn't the best referee I have ever seen, he loses control of things.

""He has definitely taken advice from the linesman or the fourth official, or both.

""All three of them could have done themselves a favour, there isn't any need to send him off.

""It wasn't excessive force. The more I see it the more I think it is a ridiculous situation.

""The ref may know the laws of the game but he doesn't know the game.""

Nuno Espirito Santo has no complaints about Willy Boly’s red card and says Wolves are ‘sad’ after their Manchester City humbling.

Gabriel Jesus bagged a brace before Conor Coady put through his own net late on.

But the big talking point of the night arrived after 19 minutes when referee Craig Pawson gave Boly his marching orders.

The Frenchman lunged in on City playmaker Bernardo Silva which left Pawson with little choice but to brandish his red card.

“It was very close to me and it’s a red card,” Nuno said. “It’s clear.

“We are sad. At the same time we have to look at the game and know what happened. We started well but conceded in a way that we shouldn't concede, then the red card.

“We stayed in the game but the speed that they move the ball is not normal so we have to be realistic.

“It was an experience for us and we have to know that it can happen. We have to improve. We knew it was tough and it became harder.”

Nuno withdrew star striker Raul Jimenez at half-time and brought on Adama Traore, who City boss Pep Guardiola says is ‘the fastest player I’ve seen in my life’.

Nuno explained: “We were trying to make another approach. We wanted the speed of Adama. Every time we recovered the ball we tried to find him.

75971,breitbart,"Chinese authorities berated the High Court of Hong Kong on Monday for ruling that banning face coverings in public is “unconstitutional,” claiming that only Beijing’s communist lawmakers have the right to rule on such matters.

In their ruling on Monday, two high court judges ruled that the emergency legislation imposing a ban on face masks in public areas that came into effect last month was incompatible with Hong Kong’s Basic Law. They also ruled that the law had violated people’s fundamental rights and freedoms.

“The need for an urgent response is no justification for departing from or impugning the constitutional scheme,” the judges wrote in their ruling “We believe [the ordinance] is not compatible with the constitutional order laid down by the Basic Law.”

The Basic Law is essentially the city’s constitution. Under the “One Country, Two Systems” policy, Hong Kong is not a sovereign entity, but China cannot impose its laws there.

In response, local authorities confirmed that they would impose a temporary ban on the masks after prosecutors sought adjournment “to consider the situation.”

The ruling sparked a furious reaction from Beijing. Jian Tiewei, a spokesperson for the Chinese legislative affairs commission, declared that the National People’s Congress had the sole authority to rule on constitutional matters in the region. The National People’s Congress is the chief lawmaking body of China.

“Whether the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region comply with the Basic Law of Hong Kong can only be judged and decided by the standing committee of the National People’s Congress,” said Jian. “No other authority has the right to make judgments and decisions.”

Jian added that the ruling “severely weakened the governance” of Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam, who was appointed by China on the basis that she would bow to Beijing’s demands.

He did not explain how giving the Chinese legislature sole power to write and interpret Hong Kong law fits into the “One Country, Two Systems” policy.

According to the Chinese state propaganda outlet Global Times, the verdict will “further disrupt the value of right from wrong in Hong Kong society and make some people show more sympathy to rioters, instead of stepping up their criticism of violence.”

“Opposition in the city has always accused the police of ‘abuse of force,’ but never condemned those rioters who sabotage the city and attack the police lethally,” the Times argued. “The court’s verdict will let the opposition believe that this is their victory.”

Hong Kong has experienced widespread civil unrest since early June when pro-democracy activists took to the streets to oppose an extradition bill that would have permitted criminal suspects to be sent to China for trial. The protesters have since added four demands, including the direct election of lawmakers to ensure control over what laws get written, to their list.

“The growing violence has almost destroyed the rule of law in and the modernity of Hong Kong. The city is at its last gasp as an international financial center. And the current ruling has closed its door to the emergency room,” the Times continued. “It is a pity that some judges in Hong Kong have not fully fulfilled their responsibility to jointly fight violence.”

Although Carrie Lam has since scrapped the proposal, the demonstrations have continued for the four other demands.

The Irish Farmers Association said more than 40 per cent of all farmers in Ireland took part in the Department of Agriculture’s Green Low Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS).

However, the programmed was “over-subscribed and closed to new entrants”, said IFA president Joe Healy, who called for a series of extra State supports for farmers.

He said ineffective waste-water treatment plants run by Irish Water around the country were causing more damage to rivers and lakes than farmers.

Farmers take part in the Agricultural Sustainability Support and Advisory Programme, operated by Teagasc and dairy co-ops, which offers advice on how to protect water courses.

Calling for the reopening of GLAS to new farmers and an increase in the €10,000 grant to those qualifying, Mr Healy said efforts were also needed to improve the quality of Irish soil by a national lime-spreading programme.

Saying that action was urgently needed to tackle farming pollution, Karin Dubsky of environmental group Coastwatch said the State’s agriculture policies must change to reward good behaviour.

She said grants for better septic tanks must be made easier to get. People who knew their tanks were not adequate were “crying out” for inspections, but these could take years to happen.

The Department of Agriculture has a number of rules governing the use of fertilisers and the spreading of slurry:

* Not to spread slurry or use fertiliser when rain is due to prevent run-off;

* Not to spread both near ditches, streams and lake shores;

* Farmers should check their lands beforehand to discover how much phosphorus is needed, and not spread more than is needed;.

* Take extra care when spreading on heavy or wet soils, where fertiliser and slurry run-off is most dangerous;

Regarding nitrogen-based fertilisers, farmers are told not to spread too much since three-quarters of what is used is wasted.

* Make sure the soil fertility and soil pH is correct to get the best of the nutrients that are used.

Last Wednesday, refugee resettlement programme advisor Andrea Sinclair spoke to the council’s equal opportunities forum about the resettlement programme.

She said: “The families are geographically all over South Lanarkshire. Up to 240 individuals will be resettled in South Lanarkshire by March 2020.

“It is a big learning curve for them and for us. The job is really about thinking if you went to a foreign country and had nothing, what would you need.

“We work with families for what they need us for but the average is between six or 12 months.”

The Syrian Civil War began in March 2011 and the UK began resettling refugees in December 2015.

By March 2020, up to 3000 Syrians will have been re-homed in Scotland through the resettlement scheme which is funded by the Home Office.

To date , 11 families have settled in the Rutherglen and Cambuslang area and been supported to settle into new homes, communities, schools and work places.

Ms Sinclair outlined the process South Lanarkshire’s four-man resettlement team go through to help refugees settle in to their new homes .

She said: “It can take a while, lots of work goes into it. It can be quite a slow process.”

For the 5.6 million refugees of the conflict, the majority are currently in neighbouring countries including Turkey and Lebanon.

For those who are resettled in the UK, the process starts long before they step foot on a plane.

Lots of paper work has to be filled out and the resettlement team liaise with the Home Office to find out as much as possible about the family they will be working with in the months that follow.

The resettlement team then contact the housing department, registered social landlords and the police to find a suitable home.

Health services, schools and the DWP are all contacted to identify any issues that may crop up.

An intensive two-week period follows when the families arrive. That can include emergency health treatment if any unknown problems come to light.

Bank accounts are opened and benefits applied for so the family have a source of income until they can settle in and get jobs.

If necessary, English lessons are also set up and help to quit smoking offered as the cost of smoking in Scotland is far greater than in Syria.

Andrea commended families throughout South Lanarkshire who she described as ‘fantastic’ neighbours to the Syrian families settling in to their new homes.

A number have already gone into employment - including two with the council - or obtained an apprenticeship.

Several have gone to college and university to further their studies and one was named the British Heart Foundation’s volunteer of the year.

739954,theindependent,"Government plans to expand rules that stop families claiming benefits for more than two children were scrapped on Friday, Amber Rudd announced in her first major speech as work and pensions secretary.

Just hours after the release of a damning report into the planned expansion, which would have cut benefits among families whose children were born before the policy was even devised, Ms Rudd said that the move would not be “right”.

The policy, brought in in 2017 and which affects the child element of the already highly controversial universal credit, is designed to influence family planning decisions. But since its introduction critics have warned that the two-child limit is so damaging that it could breach fundamental human rights commitments.

Until this month the two-child cap had only included those children born since the policy’s introduction in April 2017. Until today, that cap had been due to be extended in just three weeks’ time to include all children regardless of when they were born.

The change of heart means that all children born before April 2017 will continue to be supported by universal credit – significantly altering the financial fate of around 15,000 families a year.

The U-turn anticipated the release this morning of findings from an investigation into the two child policy by the Work and Pensions Select Committee – the group that examines the policies and actions of the Department for Work and Pensions.

The committee’s report had called for the government to abandon the expansion as a matter of urgency because of the harm it could do to the nation’s poorest families.

Commenting before the U-turn was announced, the committee said that applying the rules retrospectively would entirely undermine the government’s assertion that the two-child limit is designed to influence family planning decisions because the children had already been conceived and born.

Speaking before Friday’s announcement, Frank Field, chair of the Work and Pensions Select Committee, said: “What on earth were they thinking? There are serious concerns about this policy as a whole, but the retrospective element is simply inexplicable.

“The government claims this policy is about fairness, but it’s hard to think of anything more unfair than taking money from families whose children were born before the policy was even thought of.”

Policy in Practice, which designs public policy development and implementation, predicted that, had it remained in place, the plan to expand the two-child limit would have led to 266,000 additional children living in poverty by the end of this parliament.

The move alone would have increased the levels of child poverty in the UK by more than 10 per cent and another 256,000 children already living in poverty would have fallen further into deprivation as a direct result of the expansion.

In evidence in parliament the Child Poverty Action Group stated that “you could not design a policy better to increase child poverty than this one”.

Upon taking office as the secretary of state for work and pensions in November last year, Ms Rudd wrote an open letter describing her vision for a welfare system that “represents the best of British values and has women and children at its heart”.

But the committee’s report heavily criticises fundamental elements of the existing two-child policy as it will remain.

When the policy was announced in 2015 a broad coalition of religious leaders described it as “fundamentally anti-family” owing to its likely impact on abortion rates and family stability. A couple might choose to split up to avoid the limit, the report warns, or two people may decide against coming together if they have more than two children between them.

The policy has a particular impact on couples who have conscientious or religious objections to birth control or abortion or for whom larger families are a tenet of faith, with particularly severe implications for certain faith communities. The committee also heard that it may breach a litany of human rights commitments including the fundamental human right to a private family life.

Meanwhile, the so-called “rape clause” – an exception that allows a third or subsequent child to receive benefits if their mother can “prove” that they were conceived non-consensually or under coercive control by their father – has been widely criticised.

Apart from the process of “proving” the case for the exception, the rarity of exceptions to the policy means it is easy for anyone, including the child themselves, to work out the circumstances of their conception.

At the same time, the “coercion” exception does not apply unless mother and children have managed to escape the abusive relationship: an extremely difficult and dangerous process.

205953,fortune,"The challenge of creating a greener more sustainable world isn’t being hindered by a lack of wealth or technology. What we lack is imagination.

That's the view of cutting-edge Dutch artist and designer Daan Roosegaarde.

“If we can’t imagine it, we can’t get there,’’ he says.

Roosegaarde presented several of his groundbreaking solutions to environmental problems at the Fortune Global Sustainability Forum in Yunnan, China on Friday. They include kites that generate electricity and the world’s largest air purifiers, just one of which is capable of cleaning the air in a small town. And he hasn’t just imagined them. He has designed and built them in China and other places.

Roosegaarde believe the solutions to climate change start with intelligent design. His conviction that designers can play an important role in creating change gives him a sense of optimism.

“We live in a world where we are more defined by our future than our history,’’ Roosegaarde said.

Considering rising global temperatures, plastics in the oceans, and fires in the Amazon, the future can be a source of fear and anger among many, including Roosegaarde’s students at Tongji University in Shanghai. Filled with despair, he said they want to know what they should do.

“Don’t be afraid, be curious,’’ is his advice. “I don’t believe in utopia, I believe in protopia: designing prototypes for solutions that create a better world and that can be realized. As humans, we learn, we fail, and we evolve. Stop whining and worrying. We need to fix it.” If they say it can’t be done, Roosegaarde says he's determined to do it.

Architect and designer Bill McDonough, who pioneered the concept of the Circular Economy, shares that attitude, and has hope for the future. “We don’t want to be depressed, because there is a lot of work to do,’’ he told the Fortune forum. Among McDonough's prolific works are buildings that generate more electricity than they consume and clothing that is completely biodegradable.

In dealing with government and industry leaders in China and other places, Roosegaarde said he can feel their sense of urgency about the looming threats and the need to take action.

“In China, they are searching for a new harmony between nature and economic progress. We can create a new harmony in society where clean water, clean air, and clean energy are valued. I want to be part of that transition,’’ Roosegaarde said.

McDonough feels that others are also searching for the path to a better world. At the Fortune forum, he said he was moved by the goodwill and willingness to engage he experienced from people across various disciplines and from many corners of the world.

“It was magical and beautiful,’’ he said. “And that’s why this will be possible.”

622306,thedailymirror,"A massive explosion rocked Paris this morning killing four people and sparking a huge emergency response to piles of rubble and screaming residents.

Police and paramedics were scrambled to a quiet street in the French capital after a suspected gas leak caused a giant blast.

At least four people, including two firefighters, were killed and dozens more injured after a fireball ripped through Hubert bakery on the Rue de Trevise, in Paris' ninth arrondissement.

Before the deaths were announced, 12 people were said to be in critical condition, according to a fire department spokesman. Four of those, including two firemen who were called to the gas leak prior to the explosion, were in a 'life-threatening' condition, a police spokesman confirmed.

Shocking images showed a buildings either gutted or on fire and piles of rubble littering the street.

It is thought the blast, which occurred at around 9am local time, was caused by a gas leak in the bakery.

More than 200 emergency responders attended the scene, France's Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said.

""There are casualties,"" said one emergency worker.

""A whole shop front has been taken out, and other buildings have also been severely damaged.

""It’s a Saturday morning – a lot of people were at home. Leaking gas caused the explosion, which is being viewed as an accident.""

The fire service has been seen helping stranded residents out of the apartments above the shop.

One injured victim, who works in a nearby hotel, spoke to reporters at the scene, claiming fire crews were called to reports of a gas leak in a bakery and the explosion happened around an hour later.

He also said the guests in the hotel were badly injured as a result of the blast.

An eyewitness who was staying at a hotel nearby said he saw a huge fire erupt in the building blown out by the blast.

""There was broken glass everywhere, storefronts were blown out and windows were shattered up to the third and fourth floors,"" said 38-year-old David Bangura.

He said that as he approached the scene, a woman was crying for help from the first floor of a building: ""Help us, help us, we have a child"".

Two helicopters landed on the nearby Place de l'Opera to evacuate victims.

According to opening hours listed online, the Hubert bakery is closed on Saturdays.

Police are warning people to avoid the area and leave the surrounding streets free for emergency vehicles.

Stranded residents in the apartments directly above the bakery were being led to safety by members of the fire service.

Some were still in pyjamas and dressing gowns as they were helped down ladders.

Those injured in the explosion was seen being stretchered into an ambulance by paramedics.

Flames were seen on the ground floor of the Hubert patisserie, and there appeared to be significant damage to the upper floors of the building, too.

One witness told French news channel BFM TV: ""I was sleeping and suddenly I heard a big explosion and windows exploded in our building. I went down and I saw it was the bakery, it's carnage.""

Another resident, who managed to escape safely, added that there was ""nothing left"" of her apartment.

A Twitter user, who lives nearby, said his windows were rattled by the force of the blast.

Another said she ""heard screaming, like some were still trapped.""

Others say the blast could be heard as far as two kilometres away from the bakery.

One social media user wrote, ""The impact is so huge, it woke everyone up. People are still stuck there.""

The French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe arrived at the scene around an hour after the explosion.

The incident has occurred on a day of high security in the French capital.

There are 5000 police on the streets of Paris today for an Act 9 ‘Day of Rage’ by the anti-government Yellow Vest movement.

They have been behind numerous acts of vandalism, including destroying parts of the Arc de Triomphe itself.

Fires have been rife and buildings smashed to pieces during nine weeks of Saturday rioting by the movement.

With the World Cup taking place in England and Wales during June and July, it has been well documented the Bears will have to play at least one home championship fixture away from Edgbaston.

Warwickshire investigated the possibility of using an out-ground within the county, but with Edgbaston hosting the second semi-final on Thursday, July 11 and the reserve day scheduled for Friday, July 12, the Edgbaston staff will be required to be on-site and are therefore not available to assist in the running of a first-class match elsewhere.

The club also considered using the Edgbaston Community Sports Ground in Portland Road but it is not capable of hosting first-class cricket. Therefore, the decision was made to choose New Road.

“I’d personally like to thank Matt Rawnsley and his team at Worcestershire for agreeing to host this fixture,” said Warwickshire chief executive Neil Snowball. “We know Blackfinch New Road is always a very popular venue for cricket fans and we believe this is our best option.

“We are also mindful of the fact our members always enjoy their visits to Worcester so this chance to play a four-day County Championship match at Blackfinch New Road will hopefully be well received.”

Members from both Warwickshire and Essex , as well as Worcestershire, will be able to use the New Road facilities during the fixture free of charge and further details on pricing for non-members will be announced.

“We are delighted to be hosting five matches in the World Cup, including a semi-final, giving us the opportunity to showcase Edgbaston’s world-class facilities and unique atmosphere to the world,” Snowball added.

“We are actively exploring our options for 2020, when we know the 50-over competition is likely to be played away from Edgbaston, and we will be considering the use of out-grounds for these matches, in addition to the use of the Community Sports Ground.”",Warwickshire's Essex Championship fixture to take place at New Road,sport,sport event,325
221501,freedombunker,"In its 2017 World Population Prospects report, the United Nations projected that world population would reach 11.2 billion by 2100 and continue to grow from there. The U.N.'s new report, however, finds that while ""a continued increase of the global population is considered the most likely outcome, there is roughly a 27 percent chance that the world's population could stabilize or even begin to decrease sometime before 2100.""

Why the change in projections? Because the global average fertility rate—which is the number of children each woman is expected to have over the course of her lifetime—is falling steeply. That rate stood at 5 per woman in 1960 and has now dropped by 2.5 per woman. Replacement fertility is generally defined as 2.1 children per woman. During the same era, global average life expectancy increased dramatically, from 52.5 years in 1960 to 72.6 years today.

The U.N. demographers calculate that the bulk of future population growth over the remainder of this century will be concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, rising from just over 1 billion people today to nearly 3.8 billion by 2100. In contrast, populations in most of Asia, Europe, Latin America, and North America will peak and begin declining before the end of this century.

Demographer Wolfgang Lutz and his colleagues at the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) believe that the United Nations' projections are likely to be too high. In their 2018 demographic assessment, IIASA calculates a medium fertility scenario that would see world population peak at 9.8 billion people at around 2080 and fall to 9.5 billion by 2100.

The IIASA researchers argue that the U.N. does not take adequate account of the effects on fertility of increased levels of education, especially the schooling of girls and women.

Alternatively, assuming rapid economic growth, technological advancement, and rising levels of educational attainment for both sexes—all factors that tend to lower fertility—Lutz and his colleagues project that world population will more likely peak at around 8.9 billion by 2060 and decline to 7.8 billion by the end of the twenty-first century. The global human population stands at about 7.7 billion now.



Other global trends, such as steeply falling child mortality rates, increased urbanization, rising incomes, and the spread of political and economic freedom all strongly correlate with families choosing to have fewer children. Instead of having many children in the hope that a few might survive, more parents around the world now aim at providing their children with the skills and social capital that will enable them to flourish in a modern economy.

The trend toward lower population growth is good news because it means that the global expansion of reproductive freedom is empowering more families to decide on how many children they wish to have.",The U.N.

539144,sputnik,"The latest series of hit TV show Love Island finishes in the UK on Monday evening and Tommy Fury - brother of boxer Tyson Fury - and his girlfriend Molly-Mae Hague are the hot favourites to win the £50,000 prize.

ITV’s chief executive Carolyn McCall said last week Love Island was the most profitable show on the channel, and UberEats reportedly paid £5 million to sponsor the series, which gets five million viewers per episode, most of them aged between 16 and 34.

The current series, which is due to end on Monday, 29 July, is filmed in Majorca but next year ITV plans to add a second winter series, which will be filmed in South Africa.

​Two former contestants - Mike Thalassitis and Sophie Gradon - have committed suicide in the last year but Ms McCall said it had been almost two years since they appeared on the show and it was misleading and “strange” to link their deaths to Love Island.

Love Island is fairly cheap to make and the format has proved popular in Germany, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Australia and is set to be rolled out later this year in Hungary, Poland, New Zealand, Poland and the United States.

H. N. Lloyd, an author and social commentator, has said he felt Love Island and other reality TV shows were part of the “slow dumbing down of TV and society in general.”

“Karl Marx said religion was the opium of the people, well know the opium of the people is watching people with all the charm, wit and sophistication of a plate of mince rutting in a Spanish villa. We’ve turned people with no discernible talent or personality into heroes and figures to aspire to be like.”

Naomi Watson, a teacher from London, disagreed: “I watch Love Island and I enjoy the fact that it’s light-hearted after a long, hard day at work. It’s a nice way to unwind, to watch something that doesn’t require much mental power. There is something quite comforting in watching other people’s drama. In 2019 there are lots of different things to watch on TV. It’s about choice and variety. They are making it because there is an audience for it. If people want to watch documentaries they can watch them on the History Channel or Netflix.”

​Her friend, Eloisa Fitzgerald, who is also a teacher in London, said: “I watch it because it’s a way to de-stress. I find it funny. It’s not serious. It’s just temporary, a short experience that people are having and you can see how relationships develop and learn about people’s values.”

She said: “It’s not dumbing down TV. It’s just the way the world is moving. There are a lot of reality programmes and people love watching things like Gogglebox, which is hilarious.”

Ms Fitzgerald said she was a bit “concerned” about the influence Love Island might have on children and she said parents should not let them watch it under a certain age.

​“Too many parents don’t keep an eye on what their kids watch,” she said.

Mr Lloyd said: “What really annoys me about Love Island and these other shows is we live in a country where people should be really, really angry. We’ve got one of the most incompetent governments ever, where a fifth of the populace live in poverty. Schools, the police and the NHS are massively under-funded. The masses should be angry as Hell and out on the streets protesting. Instead they’re sat at home, their minds numbed by reality TV and the latest flavour of Pringles.”

​Mr Lloyd said he felt Love Island was “damaging” not just to the viewers but also to the contestants.

“They get their five minutes of fame and then are left to cope in the real world. The Mental Health Foundation has said that Love Island gives young people unrealistic expectations of body image, wrapped up as being aspirational,” said Mr Lloyd.

He said: “People watch it and think ‘I want to be like that. I want to be like them. I want that lifestyle’. Yet they have no talent or discernible way of becoming famous. They think fame just comes to them without having to put the graft in.”

​Ms Watson again disagrees: “You can actually use it as a talking point to discuss with young people about unrealistic body goals and some schools are using it in PHSE (Personal Social Health and Economic education) lessons to debate body image and mindfulness.”

She said: “It’s just light entertainment and people should not take it too seriously. I certainly don’t aspire to be like some of the contestants. But I imagine some viewers may have an unhealthy relationship with them.”

​Mr Lloyd accused other shows, like The X Factor, of deliberately mocking people with mental health issues and “getting them on the show so that viewers can laugh at and mock them like a sad and tawdry 21st century Victorian freak show.”

Ms Watson and Ms Fitzgerald were both concerned about how black women in particular struggle to succeed in Love Island.

​This year Yewande Biala, a scientist from Dublin, crashed out of this year’s show early as did Samira Mighty last year.

Ms Fitzgerald said: “Black contestants find it difficult to get into the final. This year it was Yewande - who was very intelligent and attractive - and last year Samira, so it highlights the challenges particularly black women have in forming relationships with men.”

​Ms Watson said: “In that micro-habitat it amplifies everything and especially attitudes men have towards women. Samira was comparing herself to Megan (Barton-Hanson) who was fake. She was built in a factory.”

Last month Samira told the Mail on Sunday the producers of Love Island were failing when it comes to diversity.

​She said Love Island would have “token” black women contestants but she claimed they were failing to select men who wanted women who were not “blonde with big boobs.”

Meanwhile, a comprehensive bill addressing ocean concerns —  with language still being developed — will call for improving the quality of ocean water and wetlands, better salmon habitats, and rules that would protect whales from being hit by ships. “Those will be the major bills for the environmentalists,” said Dan Jacobson, Sacramento lobbyist of Environment California.

But those proposals are hardly the only environmental issues on lawmakers’ minds. Other potential legislation ranges from a move to end the practice of pumping treated sewage into the ocean to a law that would eliminate most paper shopping receipts to a smoking ban on all California state beaches. While Friday, Feb. 22, was the last day to submit bills for the current session, legislators still can rewrite the proposals’ language or even gut existing bills and substitute different measures in their place.

But most major legislation is now on the table in some form. Here are eight environmental bills to watch:

SB 1: Environmental protections. Sponsored by Sen. Toni Atkins, D-San Diego. Intended to address concerns that the federal government is rolling back or weakening key federal provisions, this bill calls on the state to memorialize federal environmental and worker safety standards in place on Jan. 1, 2017, and enforce them under state law.

SB 8, AB 1718: Ban smoking on state beaches. Sen. Steve Glazer, D-Orinda, and Assemblyman Marc Levine, D-Marin County. Jerry Brown vetoed this proposal the past two years but now there’s a new governor.

SB 54, AB 1080: Single-use plastic reduction. Sen. Ben Allen, D-Santa Monica, and Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, D-San Diego. While other legislation has focused on specific plastics, including grocery bags and straws, these companion bills would establish a comprehensive plan to “reduce and recycle” 75 percent of single-use plastics by 2030, and ensure that all single-use packaging and products are either reusable, recyclable or compostable. Right now, less than 15 percent of single-use plastic in the state is recycled, according to Allen.

SB 33: Solid waste reduction. Sen. Nancy Skinner, D-Berkeley. Current language says this would “address the collapse of foreign recycling markets by reducing solid waste generation, encourage the transition to compostable or recyclable materials, and fostering domestic recycling markets.” Specific requirements and incentives are not yet detailed.

Antarctica set to lose ice chunk twice as big as NYC Sinkholes are popping up all over California, thanks to the rain. Here’s what to know See all that water flowing into the ocean? California bill aims to save it SB 69: Climate change and ocean resiliency. Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco. This bill has not yet had its core language finalized. However, Coastkeeper Executive Director Sean Bothwell, who is collaborating on the measure, said the wide-ranging proposal would aim to improve water quality to prevent local ocean acidification, improve coastal habitats (particularly wetlands, kelp and eel grass), sequester carbon, identify marine areas that are particularly vulnerable to climate change, improve salmon habitats and prevent whales from being struck by ships.

SB 332: Wastewater recycling. Sen. Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys. To promote reuse of wastewater, this bill calls for treatment plants to reduce their ocean discharge by 50 percent by 2030 and by 95 percent by 2040.

AB 161: Paper shopping receipts. Assemblyman Philip Ting, D-San Francisco. Beginning in 2022, this would require stores to give shoppers only email or text receipts unless a paper receipt was specifically requested.

AB 176: Green jobs. Assemblywoman Sabrina Cervantes, D-Riverside. This would extend tax breaks for green businesses – from 2021 to 2031.","California considers environmental laws on single-use plastics, green jobs, paper receipts and more",environment,environmental politics,604
14935,aljazeera,"A prominent Ugandan academic has bared her breasts and screamed obscenities in protest as a magistrate sentenced her to 18 months' prison on controversial charges of ""harassing"" President Yoweri Museveni.

The verdict against Stella Nyanzi on Friday drew the ire of rights activists who accused the government of using laws about electronic communications to stifle political dissent.

Nyanzi, a university lecturer and researcher who once called Museveni ""a pair of buttocks"", is expected to serve nine months in prison after having already spent nine months behind bars.

Appearing in a Kampala court via video link, Nyanzi raised her middle fingers and yelled profanities in defiance as she was sentenced, before flashing her breasts as her supporters whooped and cheered.

A plastic bottle was hurled at the magistrate as police tried to restore order.

""Dr Stella was very upset that she was not allowed to appear in court physically and instead appeared by video link,"" her lawyer, Isaac Semakadde, told AFP news agency.

""There has been lack of transparency in this trial.""

A second charge of ""offensive communication"" was dropped against Nyanzi, who has vowed not to relent in her barbed criticism of Uganda's long-serving ruler.

""I planned to offend Yoweri Museveni Kaguta, because he has offended us for 30 plus years,"" she told the courtroom on Thursday before being found guilty.

""We are tired of a dictatorship.""

Her offence stemmed from a Facebook post last year in which she said she wished Museveni, 74, had been burned up by the ""acidic pus"" in his mother's birth canal.

Prosecutors described the post as a ""brutish attack on the person of the president and his late mother"".

In a statement on Friday, Joan Nyanyuki, director for East Africa at human rights group Amnesty International, said: ""This verdict is outrageous and flies in the face of Uganda's obligations to uphold the right to freedom of expression ... and demonstrates the depths of the government's intolerance of criticism.""

The verdict should be quashed and Nyanzi, who has been in jail since November last year, freed immediately, she said.

""The Ugandan authorities must scrap the Computer Misuse Act... which has been used systematically to harass, intimidate and stifle government critics.""

Ugandan pop star turned leading opposition figure Bobi Wine, who has announced his intention to challenge Museveni in 2021 elections, defended Nyanzi's right to challenge ""dictatorship, corruption and nepotism"".

""The same courts which have... defended and shielded the champions of these ills have no moral authority to talk about morals,"" he posted on his Twitter account on Thursday.

A research associate at Kampala's prestigious Makerere University, Nyanzi holds a doctorate on sexuality in Africa and has defended her visceral attacks against Museveni and his family.

In 2017, she told AFP that ""so-called vulgar words are sometimes the best way to get your message across"".

In her most recent post, she wrote a poem about her court case: ""My presence in your court as a suspect and prisoner highlights multiple facets of dictatorship. I exposed the entrenchment of autocracy.""

Earlier this year Uganda's Supreme Court upheld a decision to remove an age cap of 75 for presidential contenders, paving the way for Museveni - who has ruled since 1986 - to run again.

108858,cnsnews,"A new bill introduced in New Mexico could make “suicide tourism” a reality.

HB 90, or “The Elizabeth Whitefield End of Life Options Act,” would allow non-residents to travel to New Mexico to pursue physician-assisted suicide. Three state municipalities have passed resolutions endorsing the legislation.

This bill could have disastrous, nationwide consequences. It also reminds us why physician-assisted suicide is so poisonous to our culture.

The U.S. suicide rate hit a 50-year record high last year—so drastic that it lowered overall average life expectancy. Our society needs to put more emphasis on the inherent dignity of every human life, not less.

Not only would this bill remove the current residency requirement on physician-assisted suicide, it also lacks many of the already insufficient so-called safeguards on the practice.

For example, the bill would allow patients to receive a diagnosis that qualifies them for physician-assisted suicide via telemedicine—no in-person visit required. That means that patients across the country could simply consult an activist group to find one of the doctors who are willing to kill those entrusted to their care, and with one phone call, procure a guaranteed referral.

That essentially means physician-assisted suicide would become accessible to every American with the means to travel.

If adopted into law, this loophole could set a dangerous precedent and lead the other five states that have legalized physician-assisted suicide to follow New Mexico’s steps.

Physician-assisted suicide is a direct attack on the inherent dignity of every human being because it treats some lives are more valuable than others. No one is safe in a culture that embraces physician-assisted suicide. Once we accept the premise that death is a legitimate “treatment” for suffering, who qualifies for physician-assisted suicide becomes a moving target.

Canada and Europe have already gotten a head start down the slippery slope. In recent months, a hospital for sick children in Toronto, Canada, debuted a plan for how to terminate the lives of terminally ill kids—with or without parental consent. Meanwhile in Europe, many countries have continually expanded who qualifies for physician-assisted suicide and even practice euthanasia—the non-voluntary killing of patients.

In places within the U.S. where physician-assisted suicide is already legal, supposed “safeguards” like waiting periods, written requests, and physician sign-offs do absolutely nothing to remove cultural pressure on patients to take their own lives or protect patients from abuse. So long as physician-assisted suicide is on the table, so too are less-than-pure motives to choose—or pressure someone to choose—death over life.

HB 90 would only exacerbate these problems by further relaxing current practices and making physician-assisted suicide available to patients across the nation.

No one should receive suicide assistance instead of suicide prevention. Instead, our culture should affirm that every human life has inherent dignity and strive to protect those who are most vulnerable: the sick and the weak, the very young and the very old.

Suicide tourism is a Pandora’s Box that would usher in untold cultural evils. It is imperative that we stop this legal loophole before it can wreak havoc on the most vulnerable in our society.

Boeing on Tuesday, February 26 named Nikki Haley, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to its board of directors.

Haley, who left the United Nations post and President Donald Trump’s administration at the end of 2018, previously served as governor of South Carolina, a southern state where Boeing has a significant manufacturing campus.

She praised Boeing as “a cutting edge industry leader” that “also understands the importance of teamwork and building community through its network of suppliers in all 50 states and around the world,” according to a statement released by the company.

Boeing’s 12-member board currently has four women. Shareholders will vote on Haley’s nomination on April 29.

The aerospace giant is weighing the launch of a new medium-sized aircraft to accompany its current fleet, which includes the twin-aisle 787 Dreamliner that is partly built in South Carolina.

Boeing garnered about 60 percent of its 2018 revenues from commercial aircraft with almost 25 percent from defense and space and the remainder from global services.

The daughter of Indian immigrants, Haley, 47, has been seen as a potential contender for national office among younger Republicans.

221838,freedombunker,"Graduation season has once again concluded, and 1.9 million Americans have left college behind and graduated with a bachelor's degree. The social and cultural pressures to attend college are high, and the financial expense to do so is just as acute. Major presidential candidates gin up their base by empathetically promising to absolve the self-inflicted financial troubles of student loans, blissfully punishing those who made sound financial college decisions. While presidential candidates are showcasing the victims of so-called nefarious student loans, celebrities are bribing university officials with millions of dollars simply to grant their children admission to state schools.

Why has America become so obsessed with an 8x11-inch piece of paper? With the advent of the internet, all the information in the history of the world is practically at our fingertips. We tend to forget much of what we learned in college a short while after graduation, anyway, and the companies we work for are often more than willing to take the tax write-off to train employees with the skills they actually need. In light of these realities, it’s time to recognize that a four-year college education should no longer be considered a prerequisite, or even a favored pathway, to the “good life.”

The human drive toward attaining the “good life,” winning accolades, and earning respect from peers is nothing new. From the University of Karueein (859 AD) to the University of Phoenix Online, humans are attempting to better themselves through experience and education. Originally, higher education was intended to produce academics—the world’s philosophers and researchers. Its purpose was primarily the pursuit of knowledge and attainment of objective truth to assist in the interpretation of this reality.

When one degree fails to provide an attractive job, the debt-laden recent grad will sometimes decide to gamble on another and hope to hit the jackpot.

But in 2019, in the United States of America, the guiding intent of higher education appears to have changed entirely. College degrees are about opening the door to the ideal job post-graduation (usually with a bit of binge-drinking and other extracurriculars thrown in for good measure). The college experience has become a path toward financial stability and not the method for attaining and discovering knowledge for knowledge’s sake.

With this incentive shift toward monetary outcomes as the point of one’s college experience, individuals and the culture at large are placing increasing emphasis on graduating at any cost. At times, when the four-year degree fails to provide an attractive job, the debt-laden recent grad will decide to gamble on the next degree with the hope of hitting the employment jackpot. And the costs can be high—enormous student loans, the opportunity cost of the time spent in college, or even the risk of incriminating oneself in a bribery scheme.

In fact, 44 million borrowers have collectively over 1.5 trillion in student loan debt, and the average student now graduates with $37,172 in student loans. The federal government is routinely providing loans that would not be available in the private sector because of the associated risk. Except for individuals in STEM programs, the likelihood that a recent graduate will find a job closely related to their major is incredibly slim, and the return on investment (four years of time and $100,000 in costs) is arguably non-existent.

The time and money spent to attain a college degree allow graduates to make a claim to a higher authority of one’s capabilities. In today’s generally atomized, fragmented, and city-centric society, most employers don’t live in a community where a young person’s skills and maturity are known and trusted. In this world, the diploma’s claim to authority seems to be necessary and convenient. However, people are starting to doubt the diploma’s authority due to degree inflation (i.e., nearly everyone has one).

Further, if a student can gain admission to a university based on bribery when he or she otherwise wouldn’t have met the entrance criteria but the student can still pass all the course work, then the academic credentials of the institution cannot be trusted. The college degree becomes an elitist and classist rubber stamp of approval that further separates those with means from those without.

Corporations can easily provide an alternative to this culturally imposed debt trap, and many are starting to do so. They can accept competent applicants fresh out of high school and train them to perform the needed jobs. This model benefits the non-college educated individual (or the pre-college educated individual) because he or she can both earn an income and gain four years of employment experience rather than attending college full-time.

The model also enables greater flexibility and profitability for corporations (with subsequent benefits to the people those businesses serve) because they can pay non-college educated individuals less since these new hires aren’t desperate to recoup financial losses from a college degree. If the social pressures toward a four-year college degree taper off, a majority of rational actors could be expected to jump at these opportunities and leave true academics to the academy.

There remains a genuine need for academics and for institutions of higher learning, research, and discussion. However, individuals who attend these institutions should be those who are seeking the truth, developing their knowledge base, and strengthening their critical thinking—not simply treating college as their only path toward the American dream or general maturation.

The current societal obsession with college degrees frequently creates barriers to entry and heavy negative trade-offs.

Human maturation and personal development should and will occur regardless of the situation or context in which people find themselves. But the academy is a place for research, development, and thought that does not innately or immediately bring with it financial reward. If there is a financial reward associated with it, market forces will fund such endeavors.

The current societal obsession with college degrees frequently creates more barriers to entry and heavy negative trade-offs for individuals who are simply looking to work hard and support their families. Whether America’s rising generation engages in “dirty jobs” or white collar jobs, college degrees should become a nice-to-have and not a must-have.",Think for Yourself and Question the Benefits of Higher Education,education,vocational education,997
1109174,windowoneurasiablog,"Staunton, December 11 -- Many have been struck by the apparent paradox that many Russians have left their country but that even among those who do, a remarkably large percentage remain supportive of the Kremlin. Some of this has natural causes, but much of it, Kseniya Kirillova says, is the result of concerted efforts by the Putin regime.

“Of course,” Kirillova says, “election results are not an absolute indicator” of the phenomenon of support for the Kremlin among Russian emigres. Many of them are seeking to assimilate to their new countries and do not take part in Russian elections, and others who oppose Putin adopted the boycott Russian opposition groups advocated.

But the voting statistics do point to a remarkable fact: a large share of Russians living abroad do choose to support the Kremlin, especially on foreign policy issues. One of the reasons for this, Kirillova suggests, is that they feel guilty toward Russia because they have moved to “’a hostile country’” like the US, an action many feel subconsciously is an act of betrayal.

Even if they have chosen to more abroad for purely personal reasons, the Russian journalist says, they do not want to be called “’traitors’” because for them, a conflict with the regime is “traumatic.” But what is important is that the Kremlin recognizes this feeling and is exploiting it by setting up various organizations to rope them in.

Many Russian emigres, “even those indifferent to politics, are quite prepared” to voice support for the Kremlin’s polices as the price of being accepted in these often nominally apolitical groups in order to “peacefully continue to live abroad while feeling at the same time ‘forgiven and accepted’ by Russia.”

And that desire is often combined with and even reinforces hostility to the country they find themselves in and often cannot adapt quickly to. Many observers write off these attitudes to “ideology, a feeling of guilt or cynicism” among Russians, but it has two broader sources, the common experiences of emigres and the actions of the Russian state.

But for most groups, this stage is relatively brief. What is worth noting is that the Russian government is doing what it can to make that stage last far longer than is normally the case and is having remarkable success in many cases because the receiving countries either do not see this as a problem or do not commit resources to counter what Moscow is doing.

“The Russian authorities are supporting the creation for compatriots abroad a special milieu, one ideologically and mentally isolated from the countries where they are,” Kirillova continues. This effort has succeeded as much as it has because of Russian psychology and the fact that the diaspora has brought with it “the sharp polarization of Russian society.”

And it has been reinforced by market forces. Moscow puts money into Russian-language outlets that push its line, and as that line is accepted, even those outlets into which Moscow hasn’t put funds find themselves repeating the line in order to expand their audiences and subscriber base.

Under these conditions, Kirillova concludes, “systematic work with the Russian-language diaspora abroad and at a minimum an attempt at creating independent media and organizations which help with the effective adaptation of emigres appears as a much more effective strategy than simply labelling all lovers of Russia ‘a fifth column.’”

Unfortunately, she suggests, labeling them in that way is not only easy but cheap; and there is a lack of understanding and financing to move in a more useful direction.","Moscow Exploiting Distinctive Experiences of Russian Emigration to Keep It Pro-Putin, Kirillova Says",society,emigration,577
1206,abcnews,"In 2018, billionaire fortunes grew by 12 percent -- about $2.5 billion every day -- as the world's 3.8 billion poorest people lost about 11 percent of their wealth, according to a report by Oxfam launched to coincide with this year's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

The number of billionaires has doubled since the financial crisis a decade ago, according to the report, with a millionaire becoming a billionaire roughly every other day.

""The last ten years clearly shows that we have learned nothing,"" Paul O'Brien, Oxfam America's vice president for policy and campaigns, said in a Jan. 20 statement. ""While corporations and the super-rich enjoy the lowest tax bills, millions of girls around the world have no access to a decent education and women are dying due to a lack of maternity care.""

Oxfam, which spans more than 90 countries and is dedicated to ending world poverty, according to the organization's website, has estimated that raising taxes by 0.5 percent on the world's richest 1 percent of earners would generate $418 billion annually that could go toward education and healthcare, ultimately saving more than 3 million people.

""The 2017 US tax bill is super-charging the worldwide tax race to the bottom and exacerbating the trend of governments dramatically cutting tax rates for wealthy individuals and corporations around the world,"" Oxfam said the statement. ""The top rate of personal income tax in rich countries fell from 62 percent in 1970 to just 38 percent in 2013. The average rate in poor countries is just 28 percent. ... The corporate tax rate has been similarly slashed around the world over the past decades, with some countries now mulling over further cuts in response to the US move to do so.""

O'Brien called the United States' latest tax law ""a master class on how to favor massive corporations and the richest citizens"" because it ""rewards US companies that have trillions stashed offshore, encourages US companies to dodge foreign taxes on their foreign profits, and fuels a global race to the bottom that benefits big business and wealthy individuals at the expense of poor people everywhere.""

Every day, Oxfam reported, about 10,000 people die because they can't access affordable healthcare.

""The only winners in the race to the bottom on corporate tax are the wealthiest among us,"" O'Brien added. ""Now is the time to work towards a new set of tax rules that work for the many, not the few.""",Billionaire fortunes grew 12 percent in 2018 as world's poorest got 11 percent poorer,politics,non-governmental organisation,401
168592,eveningstandard,"Health Secretary Matt Hancock has raised hopes of transforming one of London’s oldest hospitals after admitting he can “see the case” for rebuilding Whipps Cross.

Mr Hancock was asked to visit the increasingly busy Leytonstone hospital, parts of which date back more than 100 years, after its condition was raised by Tory MP Iain Duncan Smith at Prime Minister’s Questions.

He saw for himself how many inpatients were treated on large “Nightingale” wards, where beds are separated only by curtains and there is a risk of cross-infection and a lack of dignity.

Doctors told him how patients often have to be wheeled across an open-air footbridge to and from surgery when a lift breaks down. The hospital has an £88 million repairs backlog and bosses adopt an “Elastoplast approach” to keeping it open.

Nurses told Mr Hancock about “truly, truly awful, unbearable conditions” last summer on wards without air conditioning. Bottles of water and ice lollies were distributed daily. Bosses at Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs Whipps Cross, want to knock down derelict parts of its sprawling campus and build a new £360 million hospital, part-funded by hundreds of new homes alongside.

A new A&E department opened in 2012 and some wards and theatres have been modernised but staff say a new hospital is vital. Only 11 per cent of beds are in single rooms. Modern hospitals have about 30 to 35 per cent.

Mr Hancock told staff: “There is clearly a need for improvement to the estate of this hospital. That is evident to anybody walking around it.”

Speaking to the Standard afterwards, he said: “We have given Whipps Cross the go-ahead to take their planning for a redevelopment to the next stage.

“The amount of capital money there is for new hospitals will be in the spending review, but I can see the case for modernisation of Whipps Cross.”

Trust chief executive Alwen Williams said: “We have a golden opportunity to turn our ageing buildings and underused land into a modern hospital at the heart of a flagship health and care campus.”","I can see the case for rebuilding Whipps Cross hospital, says health minister",health,health facility,334

729037,thehuffingtonpost,"A coalition of 17 states, the District of Columbia and New York City sued the Trump administration on Wednesday to block its recent rollback of the Endangered Species Act.

The legal effort, led by the attorneys general of California, Massachusetts and Maryland, aims to safeguard one of America’s most important laws for protecting imperiled plants and animals.

“Now is the time to strengthen our planet’s biodiversity, not to destroy it,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said at a press conference Wednesday. “But instead of choosing to protect these species, the Trump administration has decided to backslide.”

Finalized last month, the Trump administration’s industry-friendly new rules weaken the popular and successful 1973 law by making it easier for federal agencies to remove species from the protected list. They also allow for economic impacts to be considered when making decisions about granting species protection, limit agencies’ ability to account for the impacts of future climate change and diminish protections for future threatened species.

Notably, the sweeping changes came on the heels of a United Nations report that found humans have driven up to 1 million species around the globe toward extinction.

“As we face a climate emergency and global extinction crisis threatening more than a million species, the Trump Administration is gutting Endangered Species Act protections to pave the way for oil and gas developments,” Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement. “We are suing to defend federal law and protect our imperiled wildlife and environment.”

The Trump administration has said the overhaul will “modernize” and “improve” the law, and that recovering populations of imperiled species is the ultimate goal. But several high-ranking officials in the Interior Department detest the law, claiming it is “a sword to tear down the American economy” and voicing support for repealing the act entirely.

“These are long overdue and necessary regulatory changes that will recover more imperiled species facing extinction than previously accomplished over the span of this law,” Interior spokesman Nick Goodwin said in a statement responding to the lawsuit. “We will see them in court, and we will be steadfast in our implementation of this important act to improve conservation efforts across the country.”

Among other things, the lawsuit argues that the Trump administration’s revisions unlawfully limit when species can receive protections under the law and insert economics into the decision-making process. Without action, it’s possible that future generations will only be able to see species like the southern sea otter or the desert tortoise in a museum, Becerra said.

The states’ lawsuit comes one month after eight environmental groups filed their own lawsuit, arguing that the changes violate the purpose of the ESA and that the administration failed to analyze the impact of its revisions.

The ESA was passed with strong bipartisan support in 1973 and has succeeded in preventing 99% of listed species from going extinct, including the Yellowstone grizzly bear, bald eagle and black-footed ferret. Today, it protects more than 1,600 plants and animals, as well as the habitats critical to their survival.",17 States Sue To Block Trump's Endangered Species Act Rollback,environment,conservation,489

Black Scientists Held Back by Perceptions of Their Priorities

New research suggests “hard/lab science” is valued over “patient-focused science” in awarding research grants.

Scientific research ideally is colorblind, with merit the only factor in hiring, publishing or the awarding of research grants. But the reality often falls short.

Eight years ago, a study published in Science found that black researchers were 10 percentage points less likely than white ones to receive funding from the National Institutes of Health, even after controlling for factors like educational background, previous research awards and publication record. Its authors theorized that the difference might reflect an accumulation of slight advantages over the course of white scientists’ careers.

That study, which the N.I.H. itself commissioned, prompted the agency to put $500 million toward a 10-year initiative to improve the situation, for example by increased mentoring of minority researchers and efforts to address possible bias in peer review.

But new research suggests racial disparity in grant funding persists, and offers a fresh theory about a source of some of it: research topic choice….

The new study, commissioned by the N.I.H. and published recently in Science Advances, examined data from nearly 160,000 applications in the years 2011 to 2015. It showed that clinical research on community-level health interventions has a harder time getting N.I.H. support than research focused on cellular science, and that black scientists are more likely to be seeking to do the former.

Disparities in topic choice among black and white scientists account for about 20 percent of the N.I.H.’s racial funding gap, according to the study.

George Santangelo, senior author of the new study and director of the N.I.H.’s Office of Portfolio Analysis, said “an inordinately large fraction of African-American applicants” applied for funding in the topic areas less likely to win funding. Nearly 40 percent of proposals from black researchers were on a cluster of eight topics, most deemed less likely to be funded.

Some of the keywords used in applications less likely to get funding: “socioeconomic,” “patient” and “disparity.” The lowest award rate was for those using the terms “ovary,” “fertility” and “reproductive.” Successful applications, by contrast, tended to use words like “neuron” and “cartilage.”",Black Scientists Held Back by Being Less Scientific,science and technology,scientific research,357
691502,theguardianuk,"Days after Egypt executed men who said they were tortured into confessions of killing the country’s former top prosecutor, Europe’s heads of state are enjoying the hospitality of its president. The resort of Sharm el-Sheikh is hosting the inaugural summit of the European Union and the Arab League. Donald Tusk, president of the European council, is co-chairing with Abdel Fatah al-Sisi; Britain’s Theresa May is among the guests.

If the event itself is a first, the approach is familiar. As Mr Sisi entrenches his rule, presiding over what Human Rights Watch calls Egypt’s worst human rights crisis in decades, European countries murmur about their “quiet diplomacy” on such issues. Then they carry on building ties and providing the air of international legitimacy that he needs given his grim record since seizing power in 2013’s coup. Mr Sisi’s recent spate of executions is instructive: he must have felt confident there would be no repercussions for putting people to death so close to the summit – despite their blatantly unfair trials.

Political dissent is suppressed through disappearances, torture and arbitrary arrests. Sami Anan, the former military chief who tried to stand against Mr Sisi in last year’s sham election, has just been jailed. Human rights defenders and labour activists are harassed and prosecuted, journalists detained and barred, the work of NGOs drastically curbed. Constitutional changes now going through parliament would allow Mr Sisi to stay in power until 2034, grant new political powers to the military, and increase presidential control of the judiciary. Once approved by legislators, they will face a referendum that promises to be as free and fair as the polls which Mr Sisi swept last year with 97% of the vote.

But EU leaders see Mr Sisi’s regime as a rare source of stability in the region, even if his actions are feeding long-term pressures. Emmanuel Macron applauds Egypt as a bulwark against terrorism while reminding Mr Sisi, sotto voce, about the need for human rights to be respected. Migration is high on the agenda; though Egypt is not currently a major transit point, talks have begun on a deal that would see Cairo cut numbers in return for economic benefits – reflecting Europe’s broader willingness to have migrants trapped in squalid and dangerous conditions if it keeps them away from our shores.

France, Egypt’s main arms supplier, also has those sales to think about – and human rights are in any case dropping down the EU’s agenda. Egyptians deserve and expect better. The constitutional coup now under way removes even the “promise or veneer” of democratic rule, notes one Egyptian author. An increasingly autocratic ruler may well believe he does not need much support when he can coerce compliance. But his predecessors thought so, too. Corruption, inflation and unemployment as well as state brutality are fuelling frustrations. A more accurate assessment of Mr Sisi’s rule might be stability – for now.

Adele Farrell had been working hard for months to compete in the PCA bikini show in Stafford last weekend.

And with help from her personal trainer, and fiancé, Robbie MacGillvray she picked up the title.

The 24-year-old mental health nurse started working out in 2016 after feeling down about buying bigger clothes every time she went shopping.

At a size 16, Adele had been doing classes for about six months. She wanted to up her workouts and that’s when she met Robbie in Motherwell’s PureGym.

Since then, they have been working hard together prepping for the show and also preparing for their wedding in Cyprus this weekend.

They made the journey down to Stafford with friends and family to watch Adele strike gold.

And Adele, who is now a size six and leaner than ever, said: “I would just like to thank everyone who supported me through prep and loved me in times I was hard to even like!

“The support I’ve had from friends and family and other bikini girls has been insane! Thanks so much to Robbie for nailing my diet and training plan to a T.

“Massive thanks to Marguerita Vonral for my Skype posing sessions and my amazing bikini, to Lorna Rogen for my posing session and my big sister Alanna and my mum for pushing me daily and supporting me from start to finish.

“And of course my friends and all the other bikini girls who have kept me motivated throughout it all – I couldn’t have got through it without you. I’m literally on cloud nine!”

Robbie said he was so proud of his wife-to-be, adding: “I’m absolutely delighted with how amazing Adele has been throughout this whole 16-week prep I’ve had her on.

“She’s stuck to my plans 100 per cent and when we got to peak week she nailed her water overload and carbing up to perfection. As you can see by her pictures on stage, she looked full. In body building terms that means her muscles are full as they are so pumped up.

“That’s exactly why you need a good coach to get this right, as it can cost you dearly on stage. I’m so proud of Adele and it makes it even more special as I’ve coached Adele from day one on this journey. Now we’re on to show two, where we will be going for first place overall, so fingers crossed.”

Adele and Robbie will tie the knot on April 19, and Robbie can’t wait to call her his wife. He said: “I’m very excited. It’s been the best year ever so far and everything has went to plan perfectly. I cannot wait to marry Adele!”

220808,freedombunker,"Philosopher Hilary Putnam famously proposed a thought experiment in which you are actually a brain nestled in a vat that has been hooked up by an evil scientist to a computer that perfectly simulates the experiences of the outside world. How can you tell that you are not, in fact, a brain in a vat?

Researchers at Yale University have taken a step toward making something like that thought experiment possible by successfully reviving some of the biological functions of brains from pigs slaughtered hours earlier. The researchers achieved this milestone by pumping into these dead pig brains their BrainEx formula, ""a hemoglobin-based, acellular, non-coagulative, echogenic, and cytoprotective perfusate that promotes recovery from anoxia, reduces reperfusion injury, prevents edema, and metabolically supports the energy requirements of the brain.""

It has long been medical dogma that brain cells cut off from oxygen die within minutes. In this case, revived brain cells began metabolizing again. This research raises two ethical issues: (1) how might this effect organ donation, and (2) should we worry about disembodied pig consciousness?

In 1968, a committee of ethicists and physicians convened at Harvard to define brain death as irreversible coma in which patients have no discernible central nervous system activity. The organs of such brain dead individuals could be harvested for transplantation into other patients. But what if something like BrainEx could, in the future, revive the brains of folks who heretofore have been declared brain dead? That might well reduce the number of potential organ donors from the 10,000 or so whose organs are harvested every year in the United States.

What about pig consciousness? Regulations that cover animal experimentation do not apply to dead animals. Nevertheless, the Yale researchers dosed their BrainEx with chemicals to block neural activity in the pigs' brains to try to ensure they never became conscious. They were also ready to administer anesthesia if the brains exhibited any electrical activity that would suggest communication between the revived neurons. No signs of porcine consciousness were detected.

What would a ""conscious"" pig brain in a vat experience? Likely not pain, since brains do not have pain receptors. If a brain is receiving no outside sensory information, would that induce terror or satori?

One other implication of this research is that improved versions of BrainEx could make possible whole body transplants of the sort being proposed by Italian neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero.",Researchers Restored Biological Function In Dead Pig Brains—and Raised Some Interesting Ethics Questions,science and technology,biomedical science,391

This is great, and should be done, but the only problem is that content around the internet is being taken down, flagged, and deemed as a ‘conspiracy theory’ when it is well-supported, factual, and backed by peer-reviewed science.

I just wrote an article about the recent measles outbreak in Washington State for example, and how that state is pushing hard for all school-aged children to receive a mandatory MMR vaccination. These outbreaks are constantly being blamed on unvaccinated children, but the mainstream never points people towards the actual statistics showing that Washington State, like many other states, have not experienced a drop in MMR vaccination coverage. Instead, MMR vaccine coverage is very high.

Furthermore, they don’t mention that there’s been a long history of measles outbreaks in highly vaccinated and fully vaccinated populations (see article linked below for examples and sources), and they don’t mention the deaths, disabilities, and adverse reactions that’ve occurred as a result of the MMR vaccine either. Why don’t they mention that the death rate from measles in Washington State was just 1.4/10,000 (source in article below) before the introduction of the vaccine? You can read more about that and access multiple studies and testimonies on this subject in the article linked below:

Biochemical Engineer Drops Bombshell Facts About Measles & The MMR Vaccine In Washington

Information and science are constantly emerging regarding vaccinations, but we never hear about any of it from mainstream media. I also recently published an article of Robert F. Kennedy explaining how big pharmaceutical companies are the biggest lobbyists, even more than big oil, and how they’ve completely compromised both the Democrats and the Republicans.

So, what’s some of the latest information regarding vaccine safety?

An article published in Nature, International Journal of Science titled “Italian scientists protest funding for vaccine-safety investigation” outlines how The National Order of Biologists made a €10,000 donation to a group that questions the safety of vaccines.

The groups name is Corvelva, and they received the donation on the 26th of October of 2018. The group believes that the research it conducts is necessary because “previous studies it has funded, which have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, indicate that some vaccines contain impurities, or lack the active ingredients they claim to contain.”

Nature points out that “Some scientists in Italy are up in arms over a donation from the organization that oversees the nation’s professional biology qualification to  an advocacy group that opposes the country’s policy of mandatory childhood vaccination.”

This part is confusing: Why would any group or any scientist oppose more safety studies regarding vaccinations? Wouldn’t professionals on both sides of the coin be in support of as much vaccine safety testing as possible?

ONB president Vincenzo D’Anna told Nature in an e-mail interview that there is a need for truly independent vaccine research because, in his opinion, work conducted in public laboratories and at universities is usually influenced or funded by companies that produce vaccines.

“The goal is to contribute to complete the biological and chemical analyses on vaccines,” he said in the interview, part of which the ONB has published in its Bulletin.

Again, Nature points out that many scientists dismiss the need for more vaccine safety testing and that they are upset. That being said, it’s a comforting thought that ONB disagrees and that they are supporting this type of thing. Clearly, many professionals within that organization don’t believe that vaccines go through rigorous safety testing, as is claimed by many. Again, what harm could be done by further testing?

The first vaccine that was tested was the Infanrix Hexa vaccine. It’s a six-in-one vaccine that’s manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) that’s supposed to contain the following antigens: tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis toxoids; inactivated poliomyelitis viral strains 1-2-3; and hepatitis B surface antigen.

Corvelva discovered that none of these antigens were actually in the vaccine, which means it had zero antibodies to the intended antigens to be created. This was a huge shock, and in addition to that they also found the following:

Traces of 65 chemical cross-contaminants from other manufacturing lines:

Tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis toxoids, D antigens of Poliomyelitis 1-2-3, hepatitis B proteins obtained with genetic engineering and Haemophylus polysaccharides chemically linked to tetanus toxoid as carrier. Toxoids are created by treatments with formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde that should remove toxicity keeping intact their ability to stimulate protective antibodies against original toxins. We were expecting to find the three toxoids and the other antigens not modified by treatment with formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde, to separate the antigens from each other and to be digestible by the enzyme specific for proteins (trypsin). We have found instead a real polymer, insoluble and indigestible, that we supposed to be the set of antigens chemically bound together (has to be defined if this is present as an aggregate of the individual antigens or a single macromolecule), on which we can find in literature partial information regarding the single antigens. This macromolecule could not be recognized in any way by the protein databases, and in fact it turned out to be a solid compound of an unknown chemical structure. Proteins solubility and their digestion (i.e. the capacity to divide them into small peptide fragments) are two typical proteins characteristics that not only makes it possible to study them through some specific analysis methods but are also fundamental for the interaction with the immune system to create protective antibodies, because if the protein structure is heavily altered from the original one, the new antibodies result completely different from those that are able to attack the original antibodies causing illnesses. Since this polymer we have encountered, derived from the antigenic mix, is not only different for its spatial conformation but it’s chemically different, so we can state that we are not facing antigens similar to the original ones but in the form of a compound with an unknown and unpredictable toxicity and efficacy. (source)

The fact that the vaccine antigens were not detected is seriously concerning, and so is the fact that, of the 65 signs of chemical contaminants, only 35% are known. This was only the first phase of this safety testing, as a second analytical study with standard controls will be released.

7 chemical toxins were also identified, and the group states that these toxins have a structure that could probably be partially derived from the formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and cyanogen bromide reactions with other chemical contaminants in the vaccine.

We’d like to point out that the toxicity of many of these toxins have been confirmed and published in Pubchem or Toxnet and this poses important safety problems, issues and concerns. From the protein and peptide fraction study, various free peptides of bacterial origin have been obtained probably coming from the bacterial culture cells used for the antigen extraction. Literature reports bacterial peptides as potential allergens 5 and also as capable of inducing autoimmune reactions 6 and these too put a safety issue that needs to be further clarified with the regulatory bodies. Coming back to the two basic principles that have been our topic on this analysis path, we reaffirm what we have said in the recent interview on the scientific journal Nature: we are inquiring the vaccines efficacy and safety and we can’t quite understand how it is possible to claim that this vaccine is even able to generate the 6 protective antibodies – reason why it is designed for – and furthermore to understand how this cluster made of 6 neurotoxic antigens bound together can be claimed as not toxic for newborns. Infanrix Hexa hexavalent, as for the method we have commissioned, casts major doubts on both its effectiveness and on its safety… One thing is for sure: we will not stop to proceed.

In the 90s, Dr. Antonietta Gatti discovered the relationship between micro- and nano-particles as well as a great number of pathologies: cardiovascular diseases, many forms of cancer, multiple neurological diseases, and autoimmune diseases. She’s taken part in many international research projects, including the pathologies induced by depleted uranium, waste incineration, food polluted with inorganic particles, and more.

Currently, she is the coordinator of the Italian Institute of Technology’s Project of Nanoecotoxicology, called INESE.

She is also a selected expert of the FAO/WHO for the safety in nanotechnological food, a Member of the NANOTOX Cluster of the European Commission, the author of the book “Nanopathology: the health impact of nanoparticles,” on the Editorial Board of the Journal of Biomaterials Applications, and a Member of the CPCM of the Italian Ministry of Defense.

Furthermore, her and her husband Dr. Stefano Montanari founded a laboratory called Nano-diagnostics for the evaluation of the pathological tissues of patients. It’s presently at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy.

Recently, the Italian police raided their home, and the police took all  digital assets that were owned by the the two nanopathologists including their laptops, computers, and flash-drives; basically years of work and research.

James Grundvig via the World Mercury Project describes what happened quite well:

“Because Gatti and Montanari had taken their research of nanodust and nanoparticles, from in-vivo (performed in a living organism) and in-vitro (performed in a test tube) to what unseen contamination might reside in vaccines in 2016, they came under the microscope of the United States, European, and Italian authorities. They had touched the third rail of medicine. They had crossed the no-go zone with the purported crime being scientific research and discovery. By finding nano-contamination in random vaccines, Gatti and Montanari revealed, for the first time, what no one knew: Vaccines had more than aluminum salts adjuvants, Polysorbate-80, and other inorganic chemicals in them, they also harbored stainless steel, tungsten, copper, and other metals and rare elements that don’t belong in shots given to fetuses, pregnant women, newborns, babies and toddlers developing their lungs, immune and nervous systems.”

The scientists published their work in January of 2017, titled, New Quality‐Control Investigations on Vaccines: Micro‐ and Nanocontamination. If science wasn’t plagued by corruption, an investigation would have started, healthcare agencies would be involved, and vaccine safety policies would have come under intense scrutiny, but that never happened.

You can read more about this story and access an interview with the scientists here.

There are numerous vaccine safety issues. The bioaccumulation of various vaccine ingredients, for example, are one. Ingredients like aluminum have been added to vaccines for more than 100 years under the assumption that they are safe. It’s only within the last couple years that scientists decided to look to see where these ingredients go after being injected. They found that aluminum, when injected, doesn’t exit the body, it actually travels to distant organs and the brain. You can access those studies and read more about that here. You can also watch a short video from Dr. Christopher Shaw from the University of British Colombia explaining the difference between injectable aluminum and the aluminum our body takes in from food. Here is another related study you can read that goes into further detail.

The main point I’m trying to make is that no parent should ever be made to feel guilty for not vaccinating their children. Vaccines are clearly not as safe as they’re marketed to be, and it’s important that we ask ourselves why this type of information goes virtually unacknowledged by the masses.","Research Reveals Plants Can Think, Choose & Remember",science and technology,biomedical science,1850
330870,nationalreview,"If you’re going to ask a conservative which predominantly leftist idea is the greatest threat to our nation’s culture of free speech, I’d expect that they’d immediately answer with “speech is violence.” It’s an understandable response. After all, “speech is violence” is not only the most dramatic claim, it’s a claim that has occasionally justified and rationalized actual violence — including on campus.

But there’s another claim, one that’s slightly less lurid and thus somewhat easier to justify. It applies in the most emotionally fraught debates about race, sexuality, and gender, and it goes something like this: No person should be required to “debate” his right to exist. Free speech is fine, but “dehumanizing” speech is something else entirely.

For example, if you argue that a man cannot get pregnant, you are “erasing” trans people. If you argue that marriage is a union of a man and a woman, then you are “dehumanizing” gay Americans. To take another example, as Jesse Singal points out in his invaluable newsletter, campus activists once tried to deny Heather Mac Donald a platform to critique Black Lives Matter by arguing that “if engaged, Heather Mac Donald would not be debating on mere difference of opinion, but the right of Black people to exist.”

As these ideas do, it has spread off-campus to Silicon Valley, where Google employees objected to Heritage Foundation president Kay Cole James’s very presence on a Google advisory panel on artificial intelligence, in part because they said they didn’t want to debate their “humanity” or because James (allegedly) believed that people like one Google critic “should not exist at all.” More than 2,500 “Googlers” signed a petition to remove her from the panel, and Google eventually canceled the board entirely.

The idea that James denies the humanity of any human is, as they say, big if true. But it’s not true. The belief that another person is created in the image of God, endowed by that same Creator with unalienable rights, but is also morally, philosophically, or scientifically wrong is not dehumanizing. It does not deny any person’s existence or proclaim that he or she should not exist.

Moreover, even if you (wrongly) believe that an opponent’s point of view dehumanizes you, should you shy away from engaging that idea? Earlier this month, Singal tweeted this obvious truth and kicked up a predictable online storm:

The debate quickly derailed into a bizarre mischaracterization of Singal’s position, with critics claiming that Singal had wrongly argued that black abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass had “debated his people to freedom.” No one thinks that emancipation was won entirely through debate and engagement, but also no reasonable person should understate the importance of debate and engagement to advancing and articulating the abolitionist idea. Slavery is reviled in modern America not just because Pickett’s Charge failed on Gettysburg’s third day.

Writing in The New Republic, Josephine Livingstone also took aim at Singal, arguing that “debate is fruitful when the terms of the conversation are agreed upon by both parties.” This is false — debate is often at its most valuable when you can expose the bad faith or duplicity of an opposing party. And then Livingstone makes this extraordinary statement:

But how do we know when an argument “fails” unless it is engaged, interrogated, evaluated, and — yes — debated. An argument doesn’t “fail” when it is simply declared false. It truly fails when it is tested and found wanting.

It is curious indeed that free speech is now labeled an instrument of oppression. Historically, it has been an instrument of liberation. Ask yourself, are America’s historically marginalized communities better off now or in 1924, the year before the Supreme Court made the free-speech clause of the First Amendment applicable to state and local governments in Gitlow v. New York? Douglass himself declared free speech to the “great moral renovator of society and government.” He rightly identified free speech as “the dread of tyrants.”

An atmosphere that is devoid of truly meaningful debate is one that is more likely to give birth to bankrupt ideas. And the woke progressive monocultures in quarters of academia and Silicon Valley have advanced and protected both the idea that speech is violence and the idea that disagreement is dehumanizing — especially when disagreement touches on matters of race, gender, and sexuality.

It’s an odd thing that we now take for granted the notion that traditional Christians, Jews, and Muslims can and should work together, attend schools together, and debate matters of faith with one another, even as many people now contest the idea that traditional Christians or other people of traditional faith can easily work next to (much less debate) matters close to the heart of LGBT citizens. After all, are matters of sexuality somehow more fraught than matters of eternity? Is declaring a person’s faith to be false less offensive than arguing that a man doesn’t have a uterus?

History teaches us that religious conflicts are the norm, not the exception, and rivers of blood have been spilled attempting to decide disputes over dogma through force of arms, but in the United States we’ve achieved a level of peaceful religious pluralism that is rare in the annals of world history. We have proven that we can tolerate religious differences and debate ultimate truths — matters of identity every bit as fundamental as the popular categories of modern intersectional politics, if not more so.

It’s time to recognize the American culture war for what it is — a religious dispute — and incorporate it into America’s existing religious pluralism. A Christian no more “dehumanizes” a gay man when he believes in traditional sexual morality than a gay man “dehumanizes” a Christian for believing that the theology he’s based his entire life upon is nothing but an ancient fiction. A proposed limit to freedom of conscience is no more “dehumanizing” than a proposed limit to the reach of a public-accommodation statute.

Finally, is speech really free if it can’t touch on the weightiest matters? Debates about the worst Star Wars movie (it’s still Phantom Menace, but Last Jedi is close) or even about economics or foreign policy may be interesting, and they can certainly be important, but absent debate about first principles, the First Amendment is but a trifle — a cosmetic protection for cosmetic speech. Every American should be able to handle a challenge to his or her most foundational values. Healthy pluralism requires nothing less.",‘Dehumanizing’ Speech Is Still Free Speech,religion and belief,religious conflict,1062

KAZAN, November 14. /TASS/. President of Tatarstan Rustam Minnikhanov shared his experience in develpoing multinational and multireligious tolerance with the participants of the World Tolerance Summit in Dubai, said the presidential press service on Thursday.

“The Council under the President of Tatarstan on multinational and interreligious relations is working in the republic. We adopted a concept on national state policy. A scientific and expert council operates on the basis of Kazan Federal University. And of course, in our affairs we rely on our muftiate and metropolis which allows us to ensure peace, harmony and stability,” said Minnikhanov.

The president noted that in total about 4 million people live in Tatarstan — representatives of 173 nationalities. According to him, the republic has extensive experience of muslims and orthodox christians living side by side. They have a mutual understanding them, he noted. A lot of mosques and cathedrals were lost during the Soviet period. Since the 90s to the present day, a number of religious sites are still being restored, noted the president.

“But our main task was to prepare people, theologists, who could properly build this system. At present, the Tatarstan Metropolis and the Spiritual Administration of Muslims make a huge contribution to strengthening tolerance and stability in the republic. All events in Tatarstan are held with the participation of our main religious figures,” he added.

According to the Tatarstan leader, the republic simultaneously restoring both Muslim and Orthodox shrines. For example, the Kul Sharif Mosque and the Orthodox Annunciation Cathedral are located on the territory of the Kazan Kremlin. The republic’s fund for the revival of historical and cultural monuments did an enormous job to restore Ancient Bolgar and the island city of Sviyazhsk. Work on recreating the Cathedral of the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God is underway, the Bolgar Islamic Academy was opened.

The republic pays special attention to issues of religious education. “People can be swayed by different beliefs. Thus, we make sure that the system of Islamic and Orthodox education is structured and that various harmful trends do not cause any problems,” said Minnikhanov.

The II World Tolerance Summit is being is held in Dubai on November 13-14 bringing together representatives of various states, religious institutions, educational institutions, cultural associations, non-governmental organizations and influencers. The summit is dedicated to tolerance and cultural understanding aimed at strengthening peace and mutual understanding between people.

499905,sottnet,"Having decided to become a high school teacher, I was excited to be accepted to the University of Washington's Secondary Teacher Education Program (STEP), which awards a masters degree in teaching and bills itself as a 12-month combination of theory and practice. Cognizant that in just over a year I would be responsible for teaching students on my own, and because of the university's laudable reputation, I expected the program to be grounded in challenging practical work and research, both in terms of how to develop academic skills in young people, and also in the crucial role public education has in overcoming some of the most grave and intransigent problems in society.I am not interested in politics or controversy, and I derive no pleasure in creating difficulties for the UW out of personal resentment. But whenever family and friends ask me about graduate school, I have to explain that rather than an academic program centered around pedagogy and public policy,As a consequence, the key components of teaching as a vocation-pedagogy and how best to disseminate knowledge-are fundamentally neglected. With little practical training or preparation, graduates of the program begin their teaching careers woefully unprepared. Even for the most ardent social justice activist, STEP's lack of practical content is a serious shortcoming.To put this in context, STEP's approach to education deserves some explanation. Public schools haven't done a great job of bridging ugly chasms in American life, such as the racial academic achievement gap between black and white populations, which has hardly narrowed since the Civil Rights Act. Discrimination based on gender and sexuality remain impediments to equality of opportunity and the way children are currently treated in public schools is clearly a part of that. The statistics on these matters are appalling, and slow progress is no excuse for complacency. Additionally, teachers should work to cultivate catholic tastes, and in light of demographic changes, white Americans shouldn't expect the literature and old-fashioned narrative history of Europe and the United States to be considered the normal curriculum, with a few token ""diverse"" authors alongside Shakespeare and Hemingway. Nonetheless, while these challenges exist, and although public education is a vital mechanism in the struggle to resolve inequality and to further the development of an open cosmopolitan culture, the program's attempts to address these issues are deeply disturbing.And so a culture emerges rapidly in the 60-student cohort in which words and phrases fall under constant scrutiny, and ideas thought to be inimical to social justice are pounced on as oppressive. Moreover, instead of imparting knowledge about the rudiments of pedagogy or how to develop curriculum content and plan for high school classes, the faculty and leadership declare that their essential mission is to combat the colonialism, misogyny and homophobia that is endemic in American society.When you consider that STEP's ostensible purpose is to prepare graduates to become novice high school teachers, this approach in a public university is difficult to justify.With a few notable exceptions, the content one might expect to study at graduate school is absent.Students are expected to demonstrate that the attributes of their personal identity (always reduced to race, sexuality and gender, and sometimes disability status) will shape their assumptions when they work as classroom teachers. Practically speaking, the purpose is to have teachers acknowledge and embrace a broad variety of behavioral norms and activities in the classroom and to explore a wider range of academic content than has traditionally been the case in American public schools. Above all,A good illustration of this ideology in practise is manifest in ' The Case of Carla ,' a Science Education paper that has gained something of canonical status at the UW. After observing a sixth-grade classroom, the authors of this study conclude that the subconscious privileging of white students' behavior by a white teacher and her white students is the cause of an African-American girl's relatively low academic performance. In this article, sweeping conclusions about the impact of racial and gender dynamics in science education across the public school system are based on the observation of four elementary school students over a few weeks, which doesn't seem like a very robust approach. Nonetheless, the faculty of UW's Ed School treat it as an intellectual lodestar. In one of our classes, students were asked to parse a transcript from the classroom of a white American teacher in which she challenged one of her Native American students who had claimed that water is biologically alive. Rather than analyzing her academic aims, how she came to develop her lesson plan, or her pedagogical techniques, the purpose of this session was to impress upon us that she was perpetuating oppression because she had rejected the spiritual beliefs of a non-Western culture.STEP's relentless assumption is that group identity is the most important determinant of success or failure in public education and in civic life, and that all inequality can be attributed to discrimination, conscious or unconscious, perpetrated primarily by straight white men and other reactionary elements. BecauseThis focus on ideology comes at the cost of studying the craft of teaching or how to productively deal with difficult social problems on a small scale. Much of the practical teaching guidance we were given has no demonstrable efficacy or validation in the peer-reviewed literature.. STEP is a travesty in its disservice to its own students and, because the program neglects the practice of teaching in favor of pontifications on social justice, it lets down the disadvantaged children it purports to serve. Each year it sends out a cohort of graduates who, due to a lack of preparation, are likely to become overwhelmed in a profession already suffering from alarming rates of attrition, particularly in high-needs schools.One of the more peculiar and psychologically manipulative requirements in STEP is called. White students are required to demonstrate contrition for their privilege with examples of how whiteness, latent racism, and America's institutionalized racism has benefitted them personally. Essentially, in these classes white people are asked to sit around to free-associate and express how badly they feel about race relations in America. Students of color are put in a separate caucus and at the close of the first quarter the two groups are united into one caucus and, convening in a large circle, are asked to stand up and pat their thighs, rub their palms together and click their fingers-to create the sound of a thunderstorm, for some reason. If my experience is anything to go by, the students of color then regale the group with their painful experiences and excoriate the white students, making accusations of racism and subconscious marginalization. After many tears and public apologies, my caucus finished with everyone being asked to hug one another.This, inevitably, led to further apologies, crying, hand-wringing, mandatory contrite letter-writing for white students, and a deep sense of foreboding each week as the class descended further into chaos and uncertainty from which it never recovered.The worrying educational disparity between girls and boys that has emerged in recent decades-whereby girls outperform boys in every educational phase-was not discussed, presumably because it falls outside the paradigm of male privilege and female oppression. Again and again, for months on end, several professors addressed the concept of microaggressions, always in a blatantly accusatory manner, as if graduate students in Seattle are likely to say to a female student ""You're smart-for a girl!"" or ask an Asian-American person: ""But, where are you really from?""In STEP it is considered wholly appropriate to saddle an individual with all the characteristics of their group identity, a frightening concept indeed, which obviously has a real effect on how students conduct themselves towards one another, and, presumably, their future pupils.Another interesting and lengthy feature in STEP areStudents and instructors then parse the performances and discuss the dynamics of identity that play out in each scene. Eventually, when I questioned the pedagogical rationale of the ""Theatre of the Oppressed"" and the inordinate amount of time being spent on these workshops-I was paying good money for this course-I was told that it would help me as a classroom teacher to avoid the ""violence"" shown in the theatre scenes. When I pressed the TA to show me the evidence that this was an effective method, I was told that these workshops are ""considered valuable"" and that I should ""work through"" my ""discomfort."" Obviously, no evidence for their efficacy was ever presented.In one session, the instructor rejected all gender pronouns and required that we dance to Beyoncé songs while discussing instances of hetero-normative behavior and homophobia. In another class in the second quarter we were required to bring in items that represented us-a task that proved to be nothing more than Show & Tell, a harbinger of the academic rigor to come. These tasks, which require precisely no academic work, would be comical if graduate school was tuition-free and a lack of preparedness for teaching had no real-world impact.Another issue with STEP is that it woefully misallocates resources and time, even if the content under consideration is reasonable in and of itself, which it occasionally is. For instance, one class focused on the historic discrimination against African-Americans in Seattle through practices like red-lining, wherein banks would refuse to grant mortgages to qualified black customers in certain neighborhoods, inhibiting the accumulation of inter-generational wealth in black communities. This class went on for an entire quarter, with presumably no purpose other than to demonstrate reasons for the educational achievement gap and the related wealth divide between black and white populations in the United States. I was shocked at the level of ignorance assumed by the faculty in a cohort of graduate students-as if educated adults would have been hitherto unaware of the effects on contemporary society of the historic persecution of African-American people. However, openly disputing the academic program would have drawn social stigma and accusations of racism or ""white fragility,"" which proved to be a powerful incentive to slog through the content, regardless of its relevance to pedagogy or the dissemination of academic knowledge to young people.. In one class, students in small groups monitor how much each person speaks, and for how long, in order to collect data on the participation rates of the various racial, gender, or sexuality categories. Incredibly, the chosen teaching method of several instructors is to put students in groups to create a poster using a sheet of butcher paper and colored Sharpies in reference to an issue raised in the week's readings, or after jigsawing a complex text between several students who have to explain it to one another. After several three-minute lectures, students then mill around the room with Post-It Notes making anodyne comments. These kinds of ridiculous juvenile tasks and restrictions, put on by professors with little work experience outside K-12 education, make a mockery of graduate school and remind you of the worst teachers you had growing up. I suppose they had one redeeming virtue: they teach you exactly how not to behave in a classroom.The program does have some elements of practical merit. A few sessions on how to create academic assessments for students were engaging and useful. I took two social studies methods classes and found them to be excellent. These classes teach you what methods to use to engage students in critical thinking and historical debate. One method, called Inquiry, calls for the teacher to ask a question, present different hypotheses and data sets, and then ask the students to work together to construct arguments for the validity of each side in a debate. Compared with lecturing, students are much more likely to engage with the content and to understand that history is debatable, authority should be challenged, opinions have to be grounded in data, and that engaging with the other side is critical in the development of academic expertise and authority. This is backed by decades of pedagogical research, and is the content that one might expect would typify the teaching in an ed school at a research university. Unfortunately, the professor who teaches these classes, who has been at the UW for more than 30 years, is about to retire, and there is no reason to expect him to be replaced by someone with a similar approach. And although he has garnered immense respect from decades of teaching and research, identity politics encroached on his classes, too: students complained of prejudice because he asked us to consider the various plausible reasons for the sinking of the Titanic as an illustration of how to debate a well-known historical narrative with high school students-this, apparently, is ""Eurocentrism.""To dispute the UW's received wisdom that a cohort of 60 graduate students should spend most of their year in ed school discussing identity politics would be tantamount to opposing the goal of ending discrimination and inequality in American life. This is how a pervasive intellectual orthodoxy emerges and remains unchallenged. And this is how the social justice elements in STEP get ratcheted up each year by a small, noisy group of committed student activists who intimidate their peers and professors into agreement and silence. Indeed, the program prides itself on its innovative and extreme measures to incorporate social justice activism into the academy with an almost theological confidence that this panacea will finally resolve all the problems in contemporary public education. At the University of Washington, the social justice zeitgeist has transformed a vocational program into something unrecognizable if you're not already familiar with campus activism., such as the courses offered by Western Governors University , an online college. A combination of that alongside easily-attainable reading materials and a chance to develop your expertise organically through field experience and trial and error and advice from veteran teachers who live and work in the real world is far more worthwhile. This is a terrible conclusion to draw, because teaching is an immensely difficult task and graduate school programs with a focus on pedagogy and academic excellence could ease the transition for novices into a successful teaching career. The instructors at STEP might even alleviate some of the social problems they claim to care about if they did.Nick Wilson is a pseudonym.

The Satanic Temple is apparently thriving with LGBT+ members.

In a interview for documentary Hail Satan? published in Attitude magazine, Satanic Temple co-founder Lucien Greaves claimed that nearly half of Satanists identify as LGBT+.

Greaves said: “It would be a conservative estimate to say that more than 50 per cent of our membership is LGBTQ.

“I think that’s because they feel disowned and disenfranchised from the traditional religious institutions.

“So, you have a population willing to embrace a religious identification that is boldly willing to speak out to the contrary.”

He added: “From the start, when one of our early actions was the Pink Mass, a lot of LGBTQ people were looking for another community that didn’t see them as defined by their sexual orientation.

“Within the Satanic Temple, we’re all pretty much one and the same.

“We’re all Satanists and it’s not like we have ‘tolerance’ for trans people or gay people or sex workers, we just don’t f**king care, and a lot of people in those communities appreciate that.”

Greaves continued: “Our chapters are always involved with Pride parades in the United States, they’re always doing something for the LGBTQ community and they’re always open about inclusion.”

He explained that before the US Supreme Court ruled in favour of equal marriage, the Satanic Temple had planned to test ‘religious freedom’ laws by holding a gay Satanic wedding.

Greaves added: “We will always fight… to the death to ensure that there are equal rights for the gay community.”

When most major religions still directly discriminate against LGBT+ people, it’s not hard to see the appeal of Satanism.

A commitment to Satan is not required to join the Temple, although a commitment to trolling anti-LGBT evangelicals is desirable.

The group’s website clarifies that members do not actually “believe in the existence of Satan or the supernatural.”

It explains: “As such, we do not promote a belief in a personal Satan. To embrace the name Satan is to embrace rational inquiry removed from supernaturalism and archaic tradition-based superstitions.

“Satanists should actively work to hone critical thinking and exercise reasonable agnosticism in all things.

“Our beliefs must be malleable to the best current scientific understandings of the material world — never the reverse.”

The group adds that “holds to the basic premise that undue suffering is bad, and that which reduces suffering is good.”",The Satanic Temple is in favour of equal rights for LGBT+ people,religion and belief,religious institutions and state relations,401

Ill-equipped private madrassas in Assam ignore child rights, junk formal education; girl students often end up as child brides

By: Firstpost
• Sep 18, 2019 (thanks to The Religion of Peace):

The Assam State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (ASCPCR), in a recent survey, has raised a red flag over blatant violation of child rights, and of the provisions of the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009 in madrassas (schools of Islamic education). The survey comes at a time when the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development is working on a road map to introduce reforms in madrassas with the aim of bringing them at par with the national educational curriculum.

The ASCPCR survey was conducted by a three-member team of the commission led by its chairperson Sunita Changkakoti in private madrassas in two districts of Assam — Dhubri and South Salmara. Both these districts, some 250 kilometres away from Guwahati, are dominated by the Bengali-origin Muslim community.

In a statement, it said, “The team of ASCPCR, during the visit to the madrassas, observed that although there are a number of madrassas for boys and girls, a majority of them are functioning with multiple violations of child rights. The team recorded multiple cases of corporal punishment, violations of the RTE Act, 2009 among the private madrassas.”

The shocking reality inside the dark rooms of the madrassas led the commission to suggest shutting down of certain madrassas for gross violation of child rights and the RTE Act.

“There are gross violations of child rights, especially against girl children. The students are not provided with basic facilities. The banat madrassas (women madrassa) keep the girl children in confinement. The food is of bad quality. There is a huge chance of sexual violations and above all, children are deprived of formal education,” Changkakoti said.

Dhubri is the least literate district in Assam with 58.34 percent literacy rate, as per the 2011 Census.

The number of madrassas in India, which came into being with the advent of the Muslim rulers in the subcontinent, has gone up from some hundreds in the 1950s to over 8 lakh in the 2000s, according to various reports. Despite widespread suspicions that such institutions encourage a fundamentalist mentality, they have increased in number in Assam’s char areas. (Char is the Assamese word for sandbar.)

Started as a means of ensuring education to the marginalised communities as a viable substitute for government schools, the private madrassas in Assam do not follow the standard formal education system. Away from any kind of government regulation, these non-registered schools house hundreds of children in tiny plots in unhygienic conditions and deprive them of formal education, consequently disconnecting them from the outer world, the commission observed.

“There are many reasons why a lot of madrassas have been coming up, although they cannot provide the kind of education needed for a person to secure a job. One of the reasons for this is the lack of government-run schools in char areas. The students have to travel 14-20 km to go to school. In most of the cases, they have to cross the river. As these madrassas provide free education and meals, the parents send their kids to these madrassas,” said Illias Rahman Sarkar, a child rights activist from Dhubri district.

As per the records of the State Madrassa Education Board, the oldest in the country, there are 614 recognised madrassas in Assam. However, the number of privately-run madrassas are in thousands, said Sarkar.

“In my area in Golakganj, you would find four-five madrassas within the radius of five kilometres. Those who pass out from private madrassas have no option other than to become daily wage earners or maulanas (religious teacher). So they would establish more madrassas to survive on donations from the people of the society,” he said.

Masud Zaman, an advocate, who is associated with the legal cell of the Assam State Jamiat Ulema-E-Hind in Dhubri district, however, felt that madrassas were acting as a place for the betterment of lives children in the char areas.

“Who goes to a madrassa? Obviously the poor people. The madrassas are providing free education and free meals. We cannot expect world-class facilities there because they are dependent on donations from society. At least these children are learning something in the schools. These schools prevent them from roaming around in an idle manner and committing crimes in that process,” Zaman said.

However, he also agreed that these private madrassas have become businesses in these districts more than institutes of religious education.

In most cases, madrassas are set up in a small cluster with mud huts and tin roofs by the donation from local villagers.

The 29-year-old Mariyam Bibi is a daily wage labourer in Guwahati. She belongs to Kamlakhar village of Golakganj revenue circle in Dhubri. Mariyam was 13 years old when she got married to one Marham Ali from Barpeta district.

“I was studying at a madrassa in my village. When I got enrolled I was eight years old. After five years of studying there, my mother said I had become ready for marriage,” she said. Mariyam’s 14-year-old daughter, a student of a banat madrassa also got married in the same district.

Changkakoti said that the girls’ madrassas were acting as grooming centres for minor girls to get married by the age of 13-14 years.

“During our visit to banat madrassas, it was observed that girls are groomed in such a way where they do not have any interest in formal education, they do not have any dream to become anything in life other than maulana and they are interested in getting married as soon as finish their course. The madrassas are depriving the girls of experiencing the big world outside. A girl gets enrolled in the madrassas at the age of 7-8. They study a four-year course on religion. After that they are considered to be fit for getting married,” the ASCPCR chairperson said.

Sarkar, who is actively working towards the eradication of child marriage from Dhubri, seconded this. He claimed that the banat madrassas are like the finishing schools for child brides in the district.

“The parents of a girl child want to get the girl married off by the age of 13-14. So they send their children to banat madrassas. As soon as the girl takes the religious education for two-three years, she is considered to be fit for marriage. So this is another reason why banat madrassas are so popular here,” he said.

Changkakoti also expressed the high possibility of sexual violence in banat madrassas.

“In banat madrassas most of the teachers are male and they have all the access to the rooms of the girl students. The girls do not know anything outside their religious education. They do not have any sex education. The female teachers are also submissive. What happens inside would never be reported,” she said.

She also said that not only girls, but there are high chances of a sexual offence against boys also.

“In many madrassas, there are boys from the age of five-six to 18-19 years. So there is every possibility of sexual harassment by elders. No one has sex education,” the ASCPCR chairperson said.

Rahman recalled an incident where a minor girl was sexually assaulted and impregnated by a maulana in one of the banat madrassas of Raniganj area in Bilashipara sub-division of the district some seven months back. However, he chose not to speak much about it.

“If I speak against the madrassas I will face the rage of my people here,” he said.

The Right to Education Act 2009, which makes formal education compulsory for children up to the age of 14, has been grossly violated by the private madrassas of the state.

Apart from religious education to students, the madrassas are not interested in linking themselves with the state board of education.

The commission in its report said, “The team recorded multiple cases of corporal punishment, violations of the RTE Act, 2009 among the private madrassas. It was also observed in the madrassas for girls that the girls were not allowed to interact with the outside world, keeping them confined inside the premises only. Even in madrassas for boys, some of them were found to be only providing religious education to the children, depriving them of the state education curriculum.”

The team which visited some madrassas during the celebration of Teachers’ Day on 5 September said the private madrassas although took part in the celebration did not know the significance of the day.

“The students would say they do not like to learn science and math. They would not want to become anything than a maulana. This is a very sorry state of affair. What would they become once they are out of it? Not everyone in these schools can become a maulana. These students will become frustrated in later part of life and contribute to the high rate of crime in such areas,” said Changakakoti.

Though Section 17 of the Right to Education Act banned corporal punishment more than a decade back, the maulanas of the madrassas have defended the practice corporal punishment to discipline students.

Rakibul Islam Ahmed, who used to be a maulana in a banat madrassa named as Al-Madrassadul Islamia in Golakganj of Dhubri district, said, “There are some boys who are very naughty. In our house also our parents sometimes beat us for not studying. In madrassas, the situation is the same. We beat them at times to teach them.”

683739,theguardianuk,"Global warming has heated the oceans by the equivalent of one atomic bomb explosion per second for the past 150 years, according to analysis of new research.

More than 90% of the heat trapped by humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions has been absorbed by the seas, with just a few per cent heating the air, land and ice caps respectively. The vast amount of energy being added to the oceans drives sea-level rise and enables hurricanes and typhoons to become more intense.

Much of the heat has been stored in the ocean depths but measurements here only began in recent decades and existing estimates of the total heat the oceans have absorbed stretch back only to about 1950. The new work extends that back to 1871. Scientists have said that understanding past changes in ocean heat was critical for predicting the future impact of climate change.

A Guardian calculation found the average heating across that 150-year period was equivalent to about 1.5 Hiroshima-size atomic bombs per second. But the heating has accelerated over that time as carbon emissions have risen, and was now the equivalent of between three and six atomic bombs per second.

“I try not to make this type of calculation, simply because I find it worrisome,” said Prof Laure Zanna, at the University of Oxford, who led the new research. “We usually try to compare the heating to [human] energy use, to make it less scary.”

She added: “But obviously, we are putting a lot of excess energy into the climate system and a lot of that ends up in the ocean,. There is no doubt.” The total heat taken up by the oceans over the past 150 years was about 1,000 times the annual energy use of the entire global population.

The research has been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and combined measurements of the surface temperature of the ocean since 1871 with computer models of ocean circulation.

Prof Samar Khatiwala, also at the University of Oxford and part of the team, said: “Our approach is akin to ‘painting’ different bits of the ocean surface with dyes of different colours and monitoring how they spread into the interior over time. If we know what the sea surface temperature anomaly was in 1871 in the North Atlantic Ocean we can figure out how much it contributes to the warming in, say, the deep Indian Ocean in 2018.”

Rising sea level has been among the most dangerous long-term impacts of climate change, threatening billions of people living in coastal cities, and estimating future rises is vital in preparing defences. Some of the rise comes from the melting of land-bound ice in Greenland and elsewhere, but another major factor has been the physical expansion of water as it gets warmer.

However, the seas do not warm uniformly as ocean currents transport heat around the world. Reconstructing the amount of heat absorbed by the oceans over the past 150 years is important as it provides a baseline. In the Atlantic, for example, the team found that half the rise seen since 1971 at low and middle latitudes resulted from heat transported into the region by currents.

The new work would help researchers make better predictions of sea-level rise for different regions in the future. “Future changes in ocean transport could have severe consequences for regional sea-level rise and the risk of coastal flooding,” the researchers said. “Understanding ocean heat change and the role of circulation in shaping the patterns of warming remain key to predicting global and regional climate change and sea-level rise.”

Dana Nuccitelli, an environmental scientist who was not involved in the new research, said: “The ocean heating rate has increased as global warming has accelerated, and the value is somewhere between roughly three to six Hiroshima bombs per second in recent decades, depending on which dataset and which timeframe is used. This new study estimates the ocean heating rate at about three Hiroshima bombs per second for the period of 1990 to 2015, which is on the low end of other estimates.”",Global warming of oceans equivalent to an atomic bomb per second,environment,climate change,669
7847,aljazeera,"Guatemala City, Guatemala - The Guatemalan Constitutional Court has suspended the decision by President Jimmy Morales's administration to end the mandate of a United Nations-backed anti-corruption commission.

The court convened overnight on Tuesday after members of civil society, lawyers and Indigenous Ancestral Authorities filed injunctions against the president's decision to withdraw from the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG).

""The court has held up the law and returned the principles of international law that are held up in [the Guatemalan] constitution. It has served as a limit to the abuses of power of any organ of the state,"" Oswaldo Samoya, a Guatemalan Constitutional lawyer, told Al Jazeera.

""It is evident that there is a desperation within the executive branch to brutally dismantle the investigations in anti-corruption efforts,"" said Samayoa.

""The Constitutional Court has once again confronted these abuses.""

The Morales administration was informed of the court's decision on Wednesday morning. It has yet to comment.

The court and Morales have been at loggerheads over CICIG, with the administration ignoring prior court decisions.

The Morales administration made the announcement that it was ending the agreement with the UN during a press conference on Monday in Guatemala City, where the president accused the anti-corruption body of polarising the country.

Morales claimed the CICIG jeopardises national security, violates human rights and is allied with criminal networks and ""terrorists"".

The anti-corruption body was given 24 hours for their investigators to leave the country. By Tuesday afternoon, CICIG investigators had fled the country, citing concern for their security.

More than 100 people protested outside the Constitutional court in Guatemala City on Tuesday, showing their support for the anti-corruption efforts by the CICIG. Protests continued Wednesday, and more are expected next week.

""The government is forcing on the state a coup d'etat to dismantle the investigations of the CICIG that are in the process and to undermine future investigations at the time of the beginning of the electoral process,"" Gabriel Wer, one of the founders of the anti-corruption group Justicia Ya, told Al Jazeera.

The Morales administration's actions against the CICIG have received widespread condemnation from the International community, including from the embassies of the United States, Germany, England, France, the European Union, and Sweden.

""The United States is concerned about the future of anti-corruption efforts in Guatemala,"" the US embassy said in a press statement. ""The rule of law, the reduction of corruption and the end of impunity are key to security, stability and prosperity, not only in Guatemala, but throughout the region.""

The CICIG was formed in 2006 upon the request of the Guatemalan government to combat high rates of impunity for crimes.

The commission was ratified by the country's legislative branch in 2007 following a massive police scandal.

The commission's 2015 corruption investigation in the administration of Otto Perez Molina led to the resignation of the former president, who is currently facing criminal charges.

Meanwhile, the country's Supreme Court began hearings on the possibility of impeaching three members of the Constitutional Court.

The hearing was called after Attorney General of the Nation Jorge Donado, who was appointed by Morales in May 2018, filed an injunction against three magistrates of the Constitutional Court.

The case against the judges is problematic, according to Samayoa.

""This is not the function of the Attorney General of the Nation, but rather the function of the Public Prosecutor's office,"" explained Samayoa.

""If the Attorney General of the Nation had evidence of an illicit action, then they should have gone to the Public Prosecutor's office for an investigation.""",Guatemala court blocks president's expulsion of anti-graft body,"crime, law and justice",judiciary,565

""Russia is a big nation and a bridge between Europe and Asia. I think you [Russia] can make some significant contribution to the promotion of peace of mind"", he noted.

""I think that Russia is a great nation, very powerful. Recent events showed that Putin as a leader of the Russian nation pays more attention to the issues in different parts of the world. I think that is good"", he admitted.

The whole world is facing a very difficult period, the Dalai Lama said in an apparent reference to numerous conflicts and arguments.

""Today the world is passing through a critical period. In such a time President Putin should think very carefully, take into consideration a wider perspective and a long-term interest. That's important"", he stressed.

The policies of US President Donald Trump did not escape the attention of the foremost spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism.

""President Trump is the leader of the great nation and carries great responsibility. I think the leader should think of a wider perspective and long-term interest – that's important. He should not think just of immediate benefits"", he said.

""President Trump, of course, it is his work. I have no right to criticize, but he has sold billions of weapons to Saudi Arabia. I think this is wrong. He also withdrew from the Paris climate accord. This is unfortunate"", he said.

""A few days ago the Japanese emperor [Naruhito] acceded to the throne, and yesterday a new British prince was born [Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's royal baby]. I really feel that [monarchy] is outdated. Russian Bolshevik revolution eliminated the czarist rule, and the French Revolution also eliminated the king’s rule. I feel this is right. All these kings, queens are part of old thinking. In that system, there was too much emphasis on military power"", he said.

""Today time has come for democracy. The world belongs to seven billion human beings, each country belongs to people of that country. When people think properly, are educated, then I don't think they would be determined to kill each other. I don't think so"", he said.

The European Union can be an example of such a system, the Dalai Lama stated.

""Take for example the European Union. In the previous century, the member states fought each other, killed each other. Then after World War II the very nations who were really involved in violence – France and Germany – they realized that now it’s much better to think about common interest rather than Germany’s interest, or France’s interest. This is a realistic approach. So the European Union was created, and in the last few decades there was no killing among its member states"", he noted.

He even suggested that Russia should once join the European Union.

The Dalai Lama admitted that Buddhism has a special connection with Russia.

""We can go side by side with modern science. In Russia, there are regions where people traditionally are Buddhists. These are republics of Kalmykia, Buryatia and Tuwa. When I was in Tibet [before 1959], we had many top scholars and abbots of big monasteries who came from Kalmykia, Buryatia and Tyva"", he added.

He recalled that through centuries Russia already has had this knowledge and contacts with Buddhism.

""So, therefore, I really feel Russian Buddhists should pay more attention to the study of Buddhism. You can take from the Buddhist literature knowledge about psychology, quantum physics, logic and study it in the academic context. It’ll be of benefit for all people – religious people and non-believers"", he noted.

He stated that many people from Mongolia and Buddhist regions of Russia are currently studying in Tibetan monasteries in India.

The Dalai Lama admitted that all religions are like medicines that help the believers ""achieve peace of mind.""

""I am a Buddhist. But I never say that Buddhism is the best religion. All major religious traditions are like medicine, they all help to achieve peace of mind. So we cannot pick up one medicine and then say this is the best for everybody. You cannot say this. The doctor first examines the patient's condition. Then he can recommend: for your case this medicine is the best. Similarly, among the believers there are so many different mental dispositions"", he said.

113233,cnsnews,"If there were a war in which the causality figures reached one million people killed or wounded, most people would want to do something drastic to stop it.  Imagine if most of those affected were young people. Consider the family, friends and community of the fallen that also would suffer greatly from these losses.

This war is happening now. It is a worldwide war from sexually transmitted diseases that are the effects of the loose morals of the sexual revolution. The total casualty figure of this war is not one million killed or wounded. It is over one million new cases a day—every day, all over the world. The war is far from over. In fact, health care officials have noted little progress in curbing infection over the last five years.

According to a study published by the Bulletin of the World Health Organization, there were 376 million new cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis and syphilis in people between the ages of 15-49 in 2016, the most recent year for which data is available. The rate of infection has remained unchanged from the data collected five years earlier.

These shocking statistics do not show the suffering caused by this war. The consequences of sexually-transmitted diseases can ruin the lives of those infected. If left untreated, the diseases can cause infertility, stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy, heart disease and neurological conditions. Infected people also run the risk of developing HIV, which causes AIDS.

As in all wars, innocent people are also affected. Many of those with diseases do not develop symptoms of illness yet can still infect others through daily or even casual contact. Still more tragic are the innocent babies in the womb that can later contract birth defects, pneumonia and blindness from their infected mothers. Syphilis, transmitted during pregnancy and childbirth, caused 200,000 stillbirths and newborn deaths in 2016.

While most of these diseases are curable, efforts to treat them are hampered by a global shortage of the medicine called benzathine penicillin. In addition, officials report strains of gonorrhea that have developed resistance to antibiotics.

Thus, the problem has reached crisis proportions. The situation should trigger an international health emergency. People should get involved to eradicate the diseases as has been done in the past.

However, this crisis is different. It cannot be combatted by improved hygiene or other healthy habits. This is not only a medical problem but also a moral problem.

People do not want to face this reality. They do not want to face the real causes of sexually-transmitted diseases, which are loose morals and promiscuous behavior. Instead, they prefer to ignore the truth. People have fallen for the myths of the sexual revolution of the sixties that claims that sexual activity outside of marriage is an entitlement. They are told that chastity is impossible to maintain.

Thus, instead of taking measures to stop the behaviors that are causing this war and inflicting such casualties, people are doing everything possible to make it worse. They are adding fuel to the fire. Officials are calling for more contraception and abortion to ensure that these acts have no consequences in the form of childbirth. A hypersexualized, porn-filled culture makes sure everyone abuses their sexual appetites to the fullest possible extent.

“We’re seeing a concerning lack of progress in stopping the spread of sexually transmitted infections worldwide,” Dr. Peter Salama, the World Health Organization executive director for universal health coverage and life course, said in a statement. “This is a wake-up call for a concerted effort to ensure everyone, everywhere can access the services they need to prevent and treat these debilitating diseases.”

1045833,trueactivist,"Marital bliss is a wonderful experience meant to last “till death do us part.” Sadly, only a few marriages last longer than 10 years with the couple going their separate ways, what more a lifetime. This is especially true for showbiz marriages among celebrities. But, against all odds, a couple of “celebrities” recently celebrated 22 years of marital bliss. Maryanne and Tommy Pilling are the UK’s first couple with Down Syndrome to tie the knot.

You can just imagine the criticism and cynicism their decision to marry received two decades ago in a church in Essex. Many thought it was a bad idea, and that their marriage would not last. The idea of two people with the condition of Down Syndrome marrying and living together was unheard of. How can two people care for each other and even raise a family if they have difficulty taking care of themselves?

Well, “love knows no bounds,” as they say, and the couple proved just that after celebrating 22 years of marriage, and living together in their own home, although Maryanne’s sister Lindi Newman and her family live next door to help out in case they need assistance. And their love gets stronger. They thank those who believed in them, particularly Maryanne’s mother, who went through a lot of negative criticism when she agreed to the wedding.

“My wedding was the best day of my life. I was shocked when Tommy proposed but I didn’t have to think twice about saying yes,” Maryanne was quoted as saying. “Tommy and I never argue. I love my husband very much. He is my best friend,” she adds. The couple re-enacted from dirty dancing their first dance to celebrate their anniversary. Even with lots of people in attendance, it appeared the couple was oblivious of the guests and danced sweetly as if they were the only ones there.

Maryanne’s sister explains, “Maryanne had dreamed about a big white wedding since she was a little girl and that’s exactly what she had. It was a beautiful day.” She continues, “When they walk down the street holding hands they make a statement but in a good way. Some people stare, they assume people with Down Syndrome and learning difficulties can’t get married. But we also get so many lovely messages from people who are inspired by their story.”

A Facebook page dedicated to the couple is managed by Maryanne’s sister Lindi. It narrates the life of the couple with wonderful pictures showing them lovingly enjoying each other’s company. Lots of people wish them well. “People worried about their own children or grandchildren with Down Syndrome get hope from Maryanne and Tommy’s story, hope that their children can also fall in love and live happily ever after,” Lindi adds.

Truly one love story for the books. The adoration, patience, and understanding they have for each other makes you wonder why some “normal” couples can’t seem to cherish their own marriages. Unconditional love from a couple with Down Syndrome conditions.

426083,pravadareport,"President Trump and young looking Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan met this week at the White House. Trump is master to transform rhetoric into reality as he did to North Korean leader. Both were trying to overcome the historic indifference and prejudice to bridge the ever widening gaps between the reality and perceptions of relationship. If nation's relationships are based on the simplicity of truth, wisdom, national interest and integrity, one could foresee political compromises as a virtue to foster friendship.  Trump's body language signaled some positive overtures as America looks for foes and friends to end its occupation of Afghanistan. Pakistan is central to this strategy to facilitate a peaceful and face-saving outcome for America militarism in Afghanistan. Truth is unchanging as it was in 2001 that George W. Bush - an emotionally disturbed and intellectually imbalanced president embarked on military intervention to invade Afghanistan to strengthen his standing before the American masses after the 9/11 events. Truth is the same today as it was almost two decade earlier that America and its NATO allies displaced and killed millions for no other reason except a preposterous and distorted version of warmongering against the poor and helpless people of Afghanistan who had nothing to do with the 9/11 tragedies.  When false assumptions go unchallenged, it breeds more reactionary forces to entrench in violence and destruction.

Bertrand Russell and Alfred Einstein Manifest (1955) called ""a war with H bomb might possibly put an end to the human race.""  In 2017, America tested the Mother of Bombs in Afghanistan as if it was an American state. This is how America and NATO destroyed the ancient and peaceful culture of Afghanistan. All wars are dreadful and end up in calamities with ripple effects for centuries to come. It is an evidence of tragic human abnormality that American, Afghan and Pakistani could not unfold humanitarian approaches to resolve the enlarged conflict in Afghanistan. Now, Trump and Imran Khan have come to understand its reality and wisdom of reciprocal forbearance that could usher a just a viable settlement in Afghanistan. But no one should underestimate the prevalent optimistic skepticism linking Pakistan and Afghanistan to a new American policy and practice for change in southwest Asia.

If America had the political, moral and intellectual capacity to honor its commitments, it could resolve the Afghan problems via a peaceful agreement with the people of Afghanistan and ensure a legitimate elected system of governance for Afghanistan. It is not the question whether Talaban or President Ashraf Ghani's party should govern Afghanistan, but the people of Afghanistan must have a participatory and final say in making the peace deal.  Rights of the people and political fairness must be the guiding principles to conclude a peace pact between the US, Pakistan and Afghanistan.  Military interventions never deliver peace and social harmony but destroy all substance that should support the societal progress and future-making.

Imran Khan should be careful to assess Pakistan's own weaknesses and strength and learn from the past as to what mistakes were made in military collaboration with the US scheme of things in the region. The USAID gimmick or the loans from the IMF are not the viable strategies for national progress and development. Pakistan must strengthen its domestic socio-economic and political productivity, advancements and integration. Its progress is a key to international cohesion and services to the neglected masses. Khan does not appear to have expertise in political change, economic productivity and nation-building. Political corruption is a cancer in the society. He should encourage and engage new generation of educated and intelligent and honest people to participate for building new public institutions, new systems of participatory governance and political accountability in all domains of affairs. Imran Khan will be wise to enlarge his circle of governance by enlisting educated and proactive visionary men of ideas and strategic experts to deliver services to the people and ensure a progressive Pakistan.

Trump to Mediate Kashmir between India and Pakistan - Will He?

As a friendly overture to softening relationship with Pakistan, Trump offered to mediate the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan.  Immediately, Indian PM' spokesperson denied Trump's assertion of PM Modi ever asking him to discuss Kashmir with Pakistan.  In politics, argument and rebuttals could be pondered with varied logical scales. There is a contrast between what India claims to be and what Pakistan stands for and what the people of Kashmir valley aspire for. If we imply canons of rationality, it could clarify the core of fault lines between tense relationships of India and Pakistan.  If India and Pakistan are sincere to find a cure to the overwhelming cruelty, military tyranny and violations of the basic rights of the people of Kashmir, the global community will view them as leaders of peaceful future-making

For a change, Trump has sensed the rationality of restoring normal ties between the two nuclear rivals. It could help him to gain some numbers in political popularity as he did on North Korea - an unthinkable probability making it thinkable reality for normalization of mutual relationship. Both India and Pakistan and given their competing claims cannot deny the fact that Kashmir is the focal issue to a normal future for the masses in both countries. War is madness if there are people of reason to think about the societal future and wellbeing of the people. Kashmir was never part of India even under the British Raj. In 1947 and 1949 at the UN Security Council Resolutions, the people of Kashmir were promised a referendum (plebiscite) to decide about their future whether to join India or Pakistan.  It is not the domestic territory of India or Pakistan to undo the truth about Kashmir. There is no sense to shed human blood on a precarious experiment whether India administers Kashmir or Pakistanis do. The conflict must be resolved by addressing the humanitarian problems and sufferings of the people of Kashmir. If Trump along with Russia and China could persuade both India and Pakistan to resolve the problem, it could open-up new threshold of peace and harmony in Southwest Asia.

In a changing world of global thinking and friendly relationships with others, American foreign policy experts should think critically how best they could communicate to a friend in Southwest Asia and enlist urgently needed moral and practical support to pave the ways for a peaceful settlement of the Afghanistan crisis. America is a military power but its legend of invincibility has been torn apart by small groups of fighters in Afghanistan. Much of this land of ancient tribal herdsmen is in ruins, its economy, political and civic infrastructures and productivity devastated by the insanity of war and civilian lives float between obsessed insecurity, daily bombings and extended graveyards. America cannot undo the history of its own ruthless engagement and strategic failure. This consequence is of its own failed strategy or no strategy at all, and not of the role of Pakistan or others. If American rational impulses are intact, its policy should focus on a multilateral approach including Pakistan, Iran, India, China and Russia to pool intellectual resources and work out negotiated settlements in Afghanistan and Kashmir. America needs to be rational and see the mirror of its prolonged involvement in a war that has consumed more than 4,000 lives of US soldiers and almost 15,000 wounded veterans. This is no excuse to reinforce aggression against the people of Afghanistan. America needs a safe exit from the prolonged self-engineered crisis.

Russia, China, India  and Pakistan Could Help America to Negotiate Peace in Asia

While individualism is a political trait, authoritarian absolutism is a political sickness and contrary to the principles of liberty and justice. America enjoins a moral and intellectual history of the making of the nation. ""These are the times that try men's soul"", wrote Thomas Paine in the Common Sense (1776), the political vision and reference for the independence of America from Britain as a nation. If global common sense is the hub of rational thoughts, America under Trump has open lines of communication with President Putin and Chinese President Xi Ping. It is rational to assume that Pakistan under PM Imran Khan could facilitate an international gathering inviting Russia, China, India and America to open a dialogue for political change and conflict resolution. This will be a magnanimous forbearance and proactive vision to dispel the notion of war and intransigence and to reshape a turbulent past, be it in Afghanistan or Kashmir and strengthen a legitimate purpose of peace, friendship and sustainable relationships without tyranny of wars and violations of human rights and dignity. Ferocity of wars and violations of human rights cannot be the intelligent hallmarks of a progressive society striving to harmonize the humanity and make sustainable peace as a reality for the future generations.

193271,eveningstandard,"The suspected killer of British millionaire businessman Matthew Gibbard in Argentina was arrested as he tried to leave the country, police in the country said today.

Mr Gibbard, 50, was shot in the chest after being followed from the airport to his five-star hotel in Buenos Aires by motorcycle gangsters who are thought to have targeted him for his expensive watch.

His stepson, Stefan Zone, 28, reportedly a product manager at JP Morgan in London, was shot in the leg and is in a stable condition in hospital.

Friends today told of their shock over Saturday’s attack. One told the Evening Standard: “It has just been traumatic. The family are devastated.”

Police apprehended the Venezuelan suspect, named locally as Angel Eduardo Lozano Azuaje, 21, in Salta, about 1,000 miles from the scene, on a coach bound for Bolivia.

Officers are understood to have been tipped off by his girlfriend during an interrogation.

He is the fifth person to be arrested over the robbery outside the £350-a-night Faena Arts Hotel. They include three Argentinians accused of supplying vehicles and the Venezuelan owner of a red Ford Fiesta which was said to have acted as a support vehicle.

Police said the gang would target wealthy holidaymakers wearing expensive watches at Ezeiza International Airport and follow their taxis to the city centre before carrying out robberies.

Chief of security for Buenos Aires, Marcelo D’Alessandro said: “This gang works in the arrivals hall of the airport, where they look for tourists coming from Europe and the United States. From there they begin their pursuit.”

He added: “They had a kind of placard, they would pretend to work for Uber.”

Mr Gibbard, from the village of Lowick, Northamptonshire, ran multimillion-pound holiday and retirement home firm Tingdene.

He is said to have been in Argentina for a Christmas break with his mother and wife Suzanne, 52, as well as Mr Zone and his stepson’s wife and brother. He was described by friends as a “softly spoken gentleman” who collected Ferraris and flew his own helicopter.",Prime suspect seized in hunt for killer of British tycoon Matthew Gibbard,"crime, law and justice",crime,328

Mayor of Jacksonville Lenny Curry confirmed a ""commercial"" plane was ""down on the river"" at 10:30pm (03:30am Saturday GMT).

He said the incident was a ""developing situation"" and urged his followers to ""pray while they [the Fire and Rescue team] work"".

Posting on Twitter, he said: ""Teams are working to control jet fuel in the water.""

Passengers could be seen standing on the wing of the plane and getting into a yellow float.

The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office confirmed the incident and a marine unit was called to the scene to assist.

The Sheriff said the plane landed in shallow water ""was not submerged"".

There were 136 passengers on board along with seven crew members.

According to a spokesperson for Naval Air Station Jacksonville, the Boeing 737 aircraft slipped off the runway while trying to land and ended up in the St John's River.

The airport spokesperson said: ""At approximately 9:40pm today, a Boeing 737 arriving from Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba into Naval Air Station Jacksonville crashed into the St. Johns River at the end of the runway.

""Navy security and emergency response personnel are on the scene and monitoring the situation.""

Mayor Curry said President Donald Trump's White House staff had called to offer help as the situation was developing.

He added: ""We are all one family. One people. One city.

""All alive and accounted for. Our Fire and Rescue teams are family to all.""

16189,aljazeera,"China's President Xi Jinping has opened celebrations to mark 70 years of Communist rule, vowing that ""no force"" would be able to shake the country, as a parade of massed troops and military hardware showcased Chinese muscle in the face of an unprecedented challenge to its authority in Hong Kong.

""There is no force that can shake the foundation of this great nation,"" Xi told invited delegates on Tuesday as he stood at the Tiananmen Square gate where Mao Zedong declared the People's Republic of China in October 1949.

""No force will be able to stop the steady march forward of the Chinese people and Chinese nation.""

Authorities in Beijing tightened security in the city ahead of the invitation-only event, cleaning up neighbourhoods, banning dogs of a certain size from the streets and ordering birds caged. Ordinary people had to stay at home if they wanted to see the event, which was broadcast live on national television.

After his speech, Xi, the country's most powerful leader since Mao, reviewed the troops from the rear of an open-topped Red Flag or Hongqi limousine, nodding occasionally to the personnel before him.

New weapons - including a hypersonic ballistic nuclear missile capable of breaching anti-missile defences to reach the United States - were rolled out across the tarmac, and soldiers marched in unison across the vast square.

The display of military might comes as Xi faces a series of challenges that threaten the economy and risk stability at home.

""The CCP is anxious,"" Xun Zhou, an expert in Chinese politics at Britain's University of Essex, wrote in a paper in The Conversation.

""Alongside continued unrest in Hong Kong and tensions with Taiwan, China's economy is flagging, the wealth gap growing, and health scandals increasing. Fewer and fewer people in China trust the current leadership.""

There is also pressure internationally, amid a trade war with the US, the detention of two Canadians in the wake of the arrest of a senior Huawei executive in Canada, and horror at the mass detention of ethnic Uighurs in the far western province of Xinjiang, to which China has responded by saying the Uighurs are being held in ""vocational training centres"".

In Hong Kong, protesters were in no mood to celebrate.

Al Jazeera's Scott Heidler said protesters were eager to use the occasion to drive their message home.

""It's a very, very important day generally for the People's Republic of China but especially for Xi Jinping,” he said. ""He has really pushed forward in his leadership this 'one China' policy and what we've seen here in Hong Kong with these protesters is going against that.""

Hong Kong's streets were quiet on Tuesday morning, with many shops opting to close and police issuing ominous warnings of trouble as the city's traditional flag-raising ceremony was moved indoors.

Since June, Hong Kong has been embroiled in the worst unrest since it reverted to Chinese rule in 1997, with riot police and protesters engaged in running battles on the streets.

Demonstrations began on Tuesday afternoon, as thousands of black-clad protesters began to march in defiance of a police decision to reject a permit for a rally.

""Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,"" they chanted. Some of the protesters torched the Chinese national flag.

Hong Kong's acting leader - Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung - said at the flag-raising ceremony that the city had become ""unrecognisable"" as a result of the protests.

Embattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam was in Beijing, pictured smiling alongside Communist Party grandees and other guests on Monday watching the air display, march and a showcase of China's newest weapons.

After 17 weeks of protests in Hong Kong, Victor Gao, vice president at the Centre for China and Globalisation in Beijing, said it was up to Lam and her government to ""step up and do their job"" in addressing the situation in the territory.

Xi referenced the ""one country, two systems"" policy under which Hong Kong enjoys freedoms unseen on the mainland in his speech, stressing it was crucial for the ""long-term prosperity and stability"" of Hong Kong and Macau, formerly a Portuguese colony.

Guy Saint-Jacques, Canada's Ambassador to China from 2012 to 2016, told Al Jazeera that ""unity"" remained one of China's paramount goals.

""The problem with Hong Kong is that China doesn't know how to handle the protests,"" Saint-Jacques said from Montreal. ""They don't have a habit of democracy and they don't know how it works. (And) they worry that the contestation in Hong Kong could spread to the mainland.""

Xi's call for unity was also directed at Taiwan, the self-ruled island where the defeated nationalists set up a government in 1949.

People on the island, which China has vowed to retake by force if necessary, appeared to have little interest in the celebrations on the mainland, even with the events in Hong Kong and Taiwan's own elections due in January.

""Frankly, there is no 'reunifying', since Taiwan is an independent country,"" said Joyce Kao, a 31-year-old marketing manager who said she had never watched the celebration and never would.

As expected, Xi referred again in Tuesday's address to his ""Chinese dream""; his plan to rejuvenate China and return the country to what he sees as its rightful place in the world.

""Today has to be understood mainly in terms of China's domestic politics,"" said Geoff Raby, who was Australia's ambassador to China between 2007 and 2011.

""This is all very much about reaffirming the leading role of the Communist Party, Xi's role at the top of the Communist Party and the extent to which the Communist Party is responsible for building a strong, prosperous and internationally-respected country.""

The Communist Party has held on to power for 70 years, despite the deaths of tens of millions of people as a result of Mao's Great Leap Forward, and the violent upheaval of the Cultural Revolution that only came to an end when Mao died in 1976.

A more open economic policy initiated by Deng Xiaoping, who followed Mao as paramount leader, helped kick-start growth and development. He also authorised the use of force to maintain power, most notoriously in Tiananmen Square in 1989.

59869,birminghammail,"A grieving family is locked in a tug of war with a Birmingham hospital which has refused to give back their dead dad’s belongings.

Pensioner Ray Amphlett was taken to City Hospital by ambulance on November 8 suffering shortness of breath, and was diagnosed with acute vascular failure.

The 74-year-old from Great Barr was transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, where five days later, daughter Leah Ellison had to make the heartbreaking decision to turn off his life support.

As Leah and her brother Mark prepared to make funeral arrangements, they contacted City Hospital to ask for Ray’s belongings, including his flat keys, car keys, wallet and watch.

Leah, also from Great Barr, later visited the hospital, taking along the death certificate, to collect them.

But, despite being Ray’s next of kin, Leah was told that she would need a copy of his will to pick up the items.

Four months, on the hospital says it now needs a grant of probate, where legal authority is given to the executor of the will.

“I spoke to a solicitor and he’s never heard anything like it before,” said mum-of-two Leah.

“When I first went into the hospital, they said they couldn’t give me his things because he could ‘have kids anywhere’.

“My dad had just died, so I got pretty upset. The woman called for her manager and said there ‘was an irate woman downstairs’.

“I just don’t understand their reasoning, and by what authority they can withhold his personal things.”

Probate is only usually necessary if a person’s estate is worth more than £15,000.

As Ray did not own his flat, and only had a small amount of savings, the family did not need it to deal with his will.

“He didn’t have a lot of money,” said Leah. “He left money for the funeral and that was about it, so we didn’t need a probate.

“I’m his next of kin so I was the one who had to decide whether to turn his machine off. I’ve also closed his bank accounts.

“But I can’t get his watch, wallet and keys back from the hospital. It is ridiculous.”

Leah says that the family has been left unable to move forward in their grief with the situation hanging over them.

“There’s no closure,” she added. “It makes us wonder whether they’ve lost his things.

“My mum said maybe we should just forget it, but I can’t now on principle. It makes me think about the people who don’t have anybody to help, and would have to go through this on their own.

“If my Dad was here, he would be fuming. He wouldn’t want any of us to have to go through this. He loved to help out his friends and neighbours, and I think he would be pretty angry.

“They’ve shown us no compassion at all.”

After being contacted by the BirminghamLive, the Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust insisted that asking for probate was standard policy.

Chief Nurse Paula Gardner said: “We offer our deepest sympathies to Raymond’s family and friends at this very difficult time.

“Our standard policy in this situation is to release personal effects to the person with the grant of probate, which identifies them as responsible for safekeeping the property.”",Family fighting City Hospital for refusing to give back dead dad's belongings,health,health facility,522

Mr Ahmed won the award for his peacemaking efforts with Eritrea after restoring relations between the two countries after many years of hostility.

He saw off competition from the likes of teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who was heavily tipped to win for her ""school strike for climate"" campaign which reached all corners of the globe.

Mr Ahmed wil be presented with the award in the Norwegian capital Oslo on December 10, along with a purse of nine million Swedish croons, or around $900,000.

Would you simply accept that this slaughter was a mistake and the “help” you are receiving from this country is worth it?

Well, that is exactly what the United States is asking Afghanistan to do right now after a drone strike Wednesday night slaughtered 30 innocent civilian farmers as they rested from a long day’s work picking pine nuts. The attack also left 40 others maimed and mangled.

“The workers had lit a bonfire and were sitting together when a drone targeted them,” tribal elder Malik Rahat Gul told Reuters by telephone from Wazir Tangi.

According to Reuters, a survivor of the drone strike said about 200 laborers were sleeping in five tents pitched near the farm when the attack happened.

“Some of us managed to escape, some were injured but many were killed,” said Juma Gul, a resident of northeastern Kunar province who had traveled along with laborers to harvest and shell pine nuts this week.

Naturally, the US is responding to the situation with a canned response and refusing to accept responsibility.

“U.S. forces conducted a drone strike against Da’esh (IS) terrorists in Nangarhar,” said Colonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan. “We are aware of allegations of the death of non-combatants and are working with local officials to determine the facts.”

Residents of the Nangarhar province spoke publicly Thursday and demanded the U.S. take responsibility for this murder.

“Such mistakes cannot be justified. American forces must realize (they) will never win the war by killing innocent civilians,” said Javed Mansur, a resident of Jalalabad city.

This slaughter comes on the heels of a rather disturbing report released by the United Nations in April detailing how in the first part of 2019, US forces and their allies killed more civilians than the Taliban and other terrorist groups.

According to the most recent UN data, Afghan civilians were killed in greater numbers by NATO and pro-government security forces in the first three months of 2019 than by armed militants. Half of those slaughtered by allied troops were women and children.

In spite of countless drone bombs raining down from the skies, Hellfire and Tomahawk missiles flattening buildings, and mass graves filled with collateral damage, the US has absolutely nothing to show for it except physically and psychologically damaged veterans and a massive trillion dollar debt.

The Congressional Research Service, for example, concluded in 2015 that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have cost U.S. taxpayers $1.6 trillion. However, according to a report from TIME magazine last year, that number is a gross underestimate.

As TFTP previously reported, according to an analysis from the “Costs of War Project” from Brown University’s Watson Institute, by the end of 2018, the U.S. War on Terror cost America taxpayers more than $5.6 trillion, which is an average of $23,386 per taxpayer.

As The Nation noted, that estimate does not include several factors such as “the psychic costs to the Americans mangled in one way or another in those never-ending conflicts. They don’t include the costs to this country’s infrastructure, which has been crumbling while taxpayer dollars flow copiously and in a remarkably—in these years, almost uniquely—bipartisan fashion into what’s still laughably called ‘national security.’”

After 18 years, there is no sign that the War on Terror is ending anytime soon, but surely the United States is finally close to defeating Al Qaeda—right?

Unfortunately, the opposite is true. A report from the Los Angeles Times noted that in 2018, “Al Qaeda may be stronger than ever,” and instead of destroying the group, “U.S. policies in the Mideast appear to have encouraged its spread.”",The Price of “Freedom”?

MOSCOW, March 12. / TASS /. The founder of Alfa Group and the largest
shareholder of the Luxembourg LetterOne holding, Mikhail Friedman is the
richest resident of London, Forbes American edition reports.

Magazine's experts calculated based on the new global ranking of the richest
people in the world, where the most number of billionaires resides, and named
the richest residents of these cities.

In London, there are 55 billionaires, with the total fortune of $226 bln,
Russian Mikhail Friedman, the co-owner of Alfa Group is the richest of them
all - his fortune is estimated at $15 bln. This is the first time that Fridman
has been named the richest Londoner. Previously, that top spot was held by the
owner of Access Industries Leonard Blavatnik, who was born in the Soviet
Union. He now resides in New York City.

Forbes Magazine also noted that Moscow is consistently among the top three
cities in which live the largest number of billionaires. In 2019, Forbes
located 71 billionaires in the Russian capital, the richest of whom is the
chairperson of the board of Novatek, Leonid Mikhelson. In the 2019 ranking on
this indicator, Moscow was ahead of only New York and Hong Kong.

In an interview with Forbes in 2017, Fridman said that he predominantly works
in London. ""I am a UK tax resident. I also have Israeli citizenship, but I
don't live there. I live in London,"" said he.

This has included Indigenous reserves that have ceased being demarcated since Bolsonaro came to power in January.

The radically far-right president and his officials have blamed environmental laws, activist groups, and indigenous peoples for hindering Brazil’s economic potential, showing scant signs that they are willing to halt the accelerated deforestation of the Amazon.

The 2 million-square-mile rainforest is a vital repository of carbon dioxide and plays a crucial role in the fight against climate change, a reality the president denies. The Amazon is also home to 10 percent of all known plant and animal species. Over the course of the past four decades, the jungle has lost a staggering 18 percent of its territory, according to Greenpeace.

Regardless, officials like Bolsonaro’s most senior security adviser, General Augusto Heleno Pereira, have shown little regard for outside concerns, remarking:

The president has also blasted the main government monitoring agency as a “fines industry,”forcing it to issue fewer penalties than at any time other over the last 11 years while inspections have reduced by 70 percent from last year.

The environment minister, Ricardo Salles, has also failed to appoint regional officials and destroyed morale in the ministry with the sacking of veteran inspectors. Folha reported that Salles plans to privatize the satellite monitoring of the forest.

Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, the president’s oldest son, introduced a bill last month that would remove the obligation of farmers to designate a minimum percentage of their property to natural vegetation. The measure would open up an area of over 412 million acres—an area larger than Iran—to the extractive industry.

A statement from Flavio Bolsonaro and Marcio Bittar, another senator backing the proposal, said:

Brazil has also become victim of a “radical, fundamentalist and irrational” environmental movement, they added, noting that “there’s no sense in the ecological clamor manufactured by Europeans, North Americans and Canadians and imposed on the country and its rural producers.”

Carlos Rittl, the executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, said:

651144,thedailyrecord,"A family say police raided their home with a drugs warrant and even ordered their son to strip to his underwear - before they realised they were on the wrong street.

The Gracey family were all staying at grandfather Joe's home after a party the day before to celebrate his granddaughter Ellie's 11th birthday.

But they were left baffled when 10 cops barged into the home, looking for people suspected of drug offences , they said.

Son Anthony, 23, was in bed when he claims officers told him to take off his boxers as part of the raid - before the entire family of six were gathered in the living room of their Glasgow home.

Joe, 60, said he told police to check paperwork ""six times"" and it was only when they called his ex wife Jacqueline, 56, by the wrong name, they realised their mistake, he said.

He said they were at the correct house number - but on the wrong street.

Grandfather-of-one Joe, lodged an official complaint with Police Scotland following the mix up, and the force said it is investigating.

Distraught retail worker, Anthony, said: ""I was fast asleep and they woke me up.

""They came upstairs and into my room. One of them said 'drop your boxers'.

""I said 'are you being serious' but they made me do it. I felt guilty but I hadn't done anything wrong.

""They made me lift up my testicles. I didn't know what to think. I've never done anything wrong in my life.

""I said I was innocent but they said they'd arrest me if I didn't shut up.

""It was really embarrassing.""

Police officers burst into Joe's home, in Easterhouse, Glasgow, at around 8.15am on July 15.

His granddaughter Ellie, 11, his sons, Anthony and Andrew, 32, and a friend, were all asleep, having celebrated the schoolgirl and ex-wife Jacqueline's birthday the day before.

Jacqueline came downstairs and noticed lots of police outside, so she opened the door and around 10 officers barged past her to get inside, he said.

""Ellie was fast asleep on the sofa and Anthony and Andrew were asleep upstairs,"" said Joe, who has a heart condition and has had two strokes.

""They said 'we have a drugs warrant' and wanted to search the house.

""Some of them went upstairs into the bedrooms everyone was woken up.

""Anthony was asked to take off his boxer shorts.

""I told them it must have been a mistake six or seven times but they didn't listen to me. I have never had anything to do with the police.

""But they just said 'we don't make mistakes'.""

Father-of-three Joe said police threatened to arrest Anthony while he argued he was innocent.

He said he has never had any dealings with police and pleaded with officers himself too.

Joe claims the whole family were made to gather in the living room, and after 15 minutes of ""sheer panic"" the penny dropped when one of the officers called Jacqueline by the wrong name.

He found a letter with his name and address on, and police realised their ""stupid"" mistake.

Joe said: ""I proved they had the wrong place with the letter.

""One of them said 'right, let's go', and they left, just like that, without an apology or anything.

""They all walked out and went to the right address.

""My granddaughter was terrified. She was inconsolable and doesn't want to come back to this house now.""

Joe said a neighbour saw police enter the same house number as him on a nearby street, moments later.

A spokesperson for the force says officers were tasked with searching a property in relation to suspected drug offences.

A Police Scotland spokesperson said: ""Police Scotland has received a complaint after officers attended the wrong address whilst executing a search warrant in the Easterhouse area of Glasgow.

150308,drudgereport,"Despite hospital systems and health officials calling out the need for more primary care doctors, graduates of U.S. medical schools are becoming less likely to choose to specialize in one of those fields.

A record-high number of primary care positions was offered in the 2019 National Resident Matching Program — known to doctors as “the Match.” It determines where a medical student will study in their chosen specialty after graduation. But this year, the percentage of primary care positions filled by fourth-year medical students was the lowest on record.

“I think part of it has to do with income,” said Mona Signer, the CEO of the Match. “Primary care specialties are not the highest paying.” She suggested that where a student gets a degree also influences the choice. “Many medical schools are part of academic medical centers where research and specialization is a priority,” she said.

The three key primary care fields are internal medicine, family medicine and pediatrics. According to the 2019 Match report, 8,116 internal medicine positions were offered, the highest number on record and the most positions offered within any specialty, but only 41.5% were filled by seniors pursuing their M.D.s from U.S. medical schools. Similar trends were seen this year in family medicine and pediatrics.

In their final year of medical school, students apply and interview for residency programs in their chosen specialty. The Match, a nonprofit group, then assigns them a residency program based on how the applicant and the program ranked each other.

Since 2011, the percentage of U.S.-trained allopathic, or M.D., physicians who have matched into primary care positions has been on the decline, according to an analysis of historical Match data by Kaiser Health News.

But, over the same period, the percentage of U.S.-trained osteopathic and foreign-trained physicians matching into primary care roles has increased. 2019 marks the first year in which the percentage of osteopathic and foreign-trained doctors surpassed the percentage of U.S. trained medical doctors matching into primary care positions.

Medical colleges granting M.D. degrees graduate nearly three-quarters of U.S. students moving on to become doctors. The rest graduate from osteopathic schools, granting D.O. degrees. The five medical schools with the highest percentage of graduates who chose primary care are all osteopathic institutions, according to the latest U.S. News & World Report survey.

Beyond the standard medical curriculum, osteopathic students receive training in manipulative medicine, a hands-on technique focused on muscles and joints that can be used to diagnose and treat conditions. They are licensed by states and work side by side with M.D.s in physician practices and health systems.

Although the osteopathic graduates have been able to join the main residency match or go through a separate osteopathic match through this year, in 2020 the two matches will be combined.

Physicians who are trained at foreign medical schools, including both U.S. and non-U.S. citizens, also take unfilled primary care residency positions. In the 2019 match, 68.9% of foreign-trained physicians went into internal medicine, family medicine and pediatrics.

But, despite osteopathic graduates and foreign-trained medical doctors taking up these primary care spots, a looming primary care physician shortage is still expected.

The Association of American Medical Colleges predicts a shortage of between 21,100 and 55,200 primary care physicians by 2032. More doctors will be needed in the coming years to care for aging baby boomers, many of whom have multiple chronic conditions. The obesity rate is also increasing, which portends more people with chronic health problems.

Studies have shown that states with a higher ratio of primary care physicians have better health and lower rates of mortality. Patients who regularly see a primary care physician also have lower health costs than those without one.

But choosing a specialty other than primary care often means a higher paycheck.

According to a recently published of physicians conducted by Medscape, internal medicine doctors’ salaries average $243,000 annually. That’s a little over half of what the highest earners, orthopedic physicians, make with an average annual salary of $482,000. Family medicine and pediatrics earn even less than internal medicine, at $231,000 and $225,000 per year, respectively.

Dr. Eric Hsieh, the internal medicine residency program director at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine, said another deterrent is the amount of time primary care doctors spend filling out patients’ electronic medical records.

“I don’t think people realize how involved electronic medical records are,” said Hsieh. “You have to synthesize everything and coordinate all of the care. And something that I see with the residents in our program is that the time spent on electronic medical records rather than caring for patients frustrates them.”

The Medscape survey confirms this. Internists appear to be more burdened with paperwork than other specialties, and 80% of internists report spending 10 or more hours a week on administrative tasks.

The result: Only 62% of internal medicine doctors said they would choose to go into their specialty again — the lowest percentage on record for all physician specialties surveyed.

Elsa Pearson, a health policy analyst at Boston University, said one way to keep and attract primary care doctors might be to shift some tasks to health care providers who aren’t doctors, such as nurse practitioners or physician assistants.

“The primary care that they provide compared to a physician is just as effective,” said Pearson. They wouldn’t replace physicians but could help lift the burden and free up doctors for more complicated care issues.

Pearson said more medical scribes, individuals who take notes for doctors while they are seeing patients, could also help to ease the doctors’ burden of electronic health record documentation.

Another solution is spreading the word about the loan forgiveness programs available to those who choose to pursue primary care, usually in an underserved area of the country, said Dr. Tyree Winters, the associate director of the pediatric residency program at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in New Jersey.

“The trend has been more so thinking about the amount of debt that a student has, compared to potential income in primary care,” said Winters. “But that’s not considering things like medical debt forgiveness through state or federal programs, which really can help individuals who want to choose primary care.”",SHORTAGE: Medical students less likely to become primary care doctors...,health,medical profession,1005

MOSCOW, February 21. /TASS/. Russia supports the current president of the
international football federation FIFA Gianni Infantino’s nomination for
another term of office, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets told TASS
in an interview.

""Russia supported Infantino’s nomination,"" Golodets said. ""What was achieved
during the FIFA World Cup evokes great respect. Infantino is committed to
Olympics principles in sports, he promotes opportunities for sports activities
for different groups of the population. He is very active in supporting
women’s sports.""

""He has displayed all the very best personal qualities, too. He is educated
and honest and a true professional,"" Golodets said.

At the beginning of February it became clear that Infantino will be the sole
candidate for FIFA’s president in the forthcoming election due at the
organization’s congress in Paris on June 5.

Infantino was elected FIFA president in February 2016 following a corruption
scandal that forced his predecessor Joseph Blatter to step down. Infantino has
implemented a package of reforms to improve FIFA’s finances and reputation.

The Wishawhill Wood pump track was this week confirmed as hosting the UK qualifying event for the Red Bull Pump Track World Championships.

After the Wishaw Press exclusively revealed back in January Red Bull’s interest in the Craigneuk track, it was revealed this week that track had beaten off competition from Glasgow’s Cathkin Braes track to host the event.

Dan Scott, from community interest company Socialtrack, has been one of the driving forces behind persuading Red Bull to come to Craigneuk as well as coaching local kids at the track.

He said: “It’s pretty awesome. A lot of work has gone into this but the hard work really starts now!

“It says a lot about the community that Red Bull have decided to come to our track. They could have held it in Glasgow but they are delighted to be able to bring it here.

“All the kids who use the track are absolutely stoked about having it here.

“They are desperate to get out on the track and do the laps.

“This is absolutely massive for them and they just want to get out there.

“This is the UK qualifiers for the world finals so we will have the best riders in the country here as well as a few international big names.

“It’s the only event being held in the UK this year so it shows just how big this is.”

The track was only formally opened in April last year.

Since then a talented group of Craigneuk kids have been showcasing their new skills at the £200,000 facility constructed by the Central Scotland Green Network Trust (CSGNT) in partnership with North Lanarkshire Council.

The work carried out by renowned international pump track specialists Velosolutions, who transformed the area of wasteland in to a world class track with the support of the local community.

It is supported by Socialtrack, Glencassels Community Development Project and Craignuek Community Council.

Craigneuk councillor Kenneth Duffy said: “This is a great news story for Craigneuk.

“The Red Bull Pump Track World Championship is held across the world, from South Africa, New Zealand, Japan and now Craigneuk.

“We can’t underestimate the great work by Social Track to attract the championships here and the support offered by North Lanarkshire Council, who will work in partnership with Social Track to make the event a huge success.

“The pump track has continued to bring nothing but benefits to our community and this recognition from Red Bull cements what I’m sure will be a lasting legacy for the track and North Lanarkshire.”

The Red Bull Pump Track World Championship qualifiers for 2019 are going to take place all around the world with more than 20 events in Europe, North America, South America and Asia.

In 2018, Mark Ducat and Alyssa Podesta were crowned the UK winners, but it was David Graf and Christa von Niederhäusern, both from Switzerland, who were crowned as world champions in the pouring rain at the Jones Center in Springdale, Arkansas.

The SNP’s Agnes Magowan added: “These days when young people are looking for activities it is amazing that the partnership of Social Track, the council and the Green Network Trust have made such a difference in the area of Craigneuk.

“Instead of pouring over screens and standing around street corners young people are outside keeping fit and socialising and widening their horizons.

“This has been widely recognised and now this prestigious world-wide event has chosen the Wishawhill Wood Pump Track for one of their UK qualifiers. What an honour!”",Huge boost for Wishaw as Red Bull bring World Championships to town,sport,sport event,577
236461,hitandrun,"From Tilsen v. Benson, decided last month by Connecticut Superior Court Judge Daniel J. Klau, but just posted on Westlaw:

""[I]n undertaking … an examination [of religious documents], a civil court must take special care to scrutinize the document in purely secular terms, and not to rely on religious precepts in determining"" the parties' intentions…. [C]ourts cannot ""take sides"" in inherently religious disputes….

""Courts have considered it constitutionally appropriate to resolve cases using neutral principles of law so long as they do not implicate or are not informed by religious doctrine or practice. Courts have properly resolved property disputes … so long as the disputes may be resolved by the application of ordinary principles of property law and without resort to ecclesiastical matters … Similarly, contractual matters, including employment disputes, may be resolved by the secular judicial system in other than religious contexts. Thus, ordinary business contracts may be litigated civilly, as may employment disputes with secular employees."" …

[It is] apparent that a trial on the validity and interpretation of the Ketubah would involve competing expert rabbinical testimony. That is, the court would have to choose between competing interpretations of the Ketubah's requirement that the parties' divorce should accord with ""Torah law."" …

As noted, the Ketubah states that the parties agreed to divorce ""according to Torah law …"" It further provides that the parties ""agreed to accept upon themselves the Rabbinic Court [the Beit Din of the Rabbinical Assembly] to instruct them in the terms of Torah law … [and to] respond to the summons of the other to appear before above-referenced Rabbinic Court, or one mutually agreed upon, to the end that both of them can live in compliance with Torah law all the days of their lives."" {[T]he plaintiff has not asked the court to order the parties to arbitrate their alimony and property division dispute before the Beit Din.} {The court does not decide whether the first amendment would bar the court from granting the types of relief that the plaintiff has not sought. But any request for a judicial order enforcing the Beit Din provision would raise serious first amendment concerns.} …

The parties married on December 3, 1989, in a ceremony conducted in accordance with Jewish tradition. Shortly before the marriage ceremony the parties signed their Ketubah—a traditional Jewish marriage contract written in Hebrew and Aramaic. Solely for the purposes of this ruling, the court accepts as accurate the plaintiff's English translation.

This memorandum of decision addresses a narrow yet dispositive issue: Assuming, without deciding, that the Ketubah is otherwise a valid prenuptial agreement under Connecticut law, does the first amendment to the United States constitution nonetheless forbid the court to enforce the cited provision? For the following reasons, the court answers that question in the affirmative….

The plaintiff seeks to enforce a Jewish marriage contract, known as a ""Ketubah,"" contending that it is a valid prenuptial agreement. In relevant part, the Ketubah states that the parties ""agreed to divorce (or, separate from) one another according to custom all the days of their life (i.e., as a continuing obligation) according to Torah law as in the manner of Jewish people."" (Emphasis added.) The plaintiff argues that ""Torah law"" mandates a 50/50 division of property and relieves him of any obligation to pay alimony to his wife of nearly thirty years. The defendant disagrees and generally contests the validity of the Ketubah as a prenuptial agreement.

The court concludes that it cannot interpret the ""Torah law"" provision of the parties' Ketubah using strictly neutral, secular legal principles. To the contrary, granting the plaintiff the specific relief he seeks based on his preferred interpretation of the Ketubah and Jewish law would excessively entangle the court in a religious dispute and, therefore, would violate the first amendment….

This case appears to be one of first impression among published opinions, certainly in Connecticut, if not nationally. Distilled to its essence, the plaintiff's argument is that the ""Torah law"" provision of the parties' Ketubah is no different from any other choice of law clause in a civil contract.

To educate the court about the parties' chosen law, the plaintiff submitted the affidavit of a rabbi, who would presumably testify at trial, describing his understanding of Torah law as it pertains to alimony and property division. The defendant also submitted the affidavit of a rabbi. However, the defendant's rabbinical expert disagrees with the plaintiff's rabbinical expert. [The court doesn't discuss whether one of the rabbis disagreed even with himself. -EV]

It is clear, then, that enforcement of the ""Torah law"" provision in the Ketubah would require the court to choose between competing interpretations of Jewish law. But resolving such a dispute is precisely what the neutral principles approach forbids a court to do. The first amendment does not permit courts to resolve disputes over the meaning and interpretation of the Torah—or the Koran, the New Testament or any other religious text. This is where the plaintiff's analogy to traditional choice of law analysis breaks down. Construing the civil law of a foreign jurisdiction (other than a pure theocracy) does not require a court to choose between competing interpretations of religious law. In other words, traditional choice of law provisions generally do not have first amendment implications.

One … commentator on first amendment issues offers the following hypothetical, which helps clarify the limits of a court's power to interpret documents with religious implications or motivations.

""Religiously motivated contracts (and wills and trusts) should be interpreted the same as secularly motivated documents, so long as they can be interpreted using neutral principles and without evaluating religious doctrine. That makes sense as a matter of contract law and wills and trusts law, and required by the Free Exercise Clause principle that people ought not be discriminated against based on the religious nature of their practices. See, e.g., Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah (1993).""

""Thus, to take the simplest example, imagine a man dies and leaves a will that provides that 2/3 of his property will go to his son and 1/3 to his daughter, and it's clear that this stems from his understanding of Islamic law, under which sons should get twice the share of daughters. Such a will, it seems to me, must be enforced, even if we think it stems from a sexist religious belief system. People are entitled to be sexist—and religiously motivated—in deciding whom to leave their property to.""

""On the other hand, if a man leaves a will that provides for division 'according to the principles of Shari'a,' courts can't enforce that, because that requires courts to interpret what Islamic religious law actually calls for, something that they can't do."" Eugene Volokh, ""Court Refuses to Enforce Islamic Premarital Agreement That Promised Wife $677,000 in the Event of Divorce,"" last modified September 10, 2012), available at http://volokh.com/2012/09/10/ court-refuses-to-enforce-islamic-premarital-agreement-that-promised-wife-677000-in-the-event-of-divorce.

The court shares the view of first amendment law expressed above. The ""Torah law"" provision in the parties' Ketubah is functionally indistinguishable from the ""Shari' a law"" provision in the hypothetical will. Interpreting what Hebrew, Islamic, Christian, Hindu, etc. law or religious doctrine requires in terms of alimony and property division is precisely the sort of task that would excessively entangle courts in inherently religious matters. The specter of a civil court being forced to decide which religious experts' proffered interpretation is more ""credible"" is also troubling.

{The plaintiff cites In re Marriage of Goldman (Ill. Ct. App. 1990) as precedent for civil courts to interpret the ""Torah law"" provision in the parties' Ketubah. The trial court in that case interpreted a Ketubah provision very similar to the one at issue here. Based on ""uncontroverted expert testimony,"" the trial court accepted the wife's argument that the general reference to ""Torah law"" required the husband to give her a Get. The court ordered specific performance of that obligation. The Illinois [court] affirmed and rejected the husband's argument that the first amendment barred the trial court from ordering him to give his wife a Get.

The court agrees with the plaintiff that in re Marriage of Goldman is relevant precedent, but it is not binding on a Connecticut Superior Court. It is also distinguishable because it involved uncontroverted expert testimony. The court declines the plaintiff's invitation to follow that case. More persuasive is Victor v. Victor (Ariz. Ct. App. 1993), in which the Arizona Appellate Court held that a comparable provision in a Ketubah was too vague to be enforceable. ""If this court were to rule on whether the ketubah, given its indefinite language, includes an unwritten mandate that a husband under these circumstances is required to grant his wife a get, we would be overstepping our authority and assuming the role of a religious court. This we decline to do.""}

Finally, this court … is unpersuaded that the distinction under Jewish law between laws governing the relationship between man and God and laws governing relationships between men avoids the first amendment problem in this case. The court acknowledges the distinction within Jewish law. Nevertheless, both categories of laws are rooted in the Torah and other textual sources of Jewish law. Even disputes over the correct interpretation of Jewish civil laws are disputes over the meaning and requirements of Jewish law. From the perspective of an American civil court—state or federal—such disputes are inherently religious….

The neutral principles approach requires civil courts to refrain from deciding disputes involving matters of religious faith, law, doctrine, practice and the ""true"" meaning of religious texts. Here, enforcement of the ""Torah law"" provision of the parties' Ketubah would require the court to choose between competing rabbinical interpretations of Jewish law. This the court cannot do without violating the first amendment….","Civil Court Can't Decide What ""Torah Law"" Means, Even if Contract Calls for Applying It",religion and belief,religious text,1599

A WADA panel last month recommended to ban Russia from global competition for four years, including next year's Olympics in Tokyo, and other measures after ""inconsistencies"" were found in laboratory data provided to the agency.

Doping allegations have plagued the country since the revelation of large-scale state-sponsored doping aimed at improving its medal performance at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Russia’s Black Sea resort of Sochi.

In September 2018, WADA lifted the suspension of the Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA that had been in place for three years on condition that Russia hand over doping data and samples from 2012 to 2015.

But WADA’s Compliance Review Committee on November 25 accused Russia of falsifying some of the data provided by a Moscow laboratory in January, and proposed to impose a four-year ban on RUSADA and to exclude the country from major sporting competitions.

The final decision will rest with WADA’s executive committee when it gathers in Paris on December 9.

If the committee adopts the recommendations, Russia would be denied its flag and anthem at events including the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo and 2022 Winter Games in Beijing -- just as they were absent from the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and the past two track-and-field world championships.

Russian athletes could compete as neutrals under the Olympic flag if they are not linked to positive doping tests or the data corruption.

WADA could also impose a four-year ban on Russia hosting, bidding for, or being awarded major sporting events such as the 2032 Summer Olympics.

Sports bodies would then be required to move events that had already been awarded, except if “it is legally or practically impossible” to move them.

Other consequences could be banning Russian government representatives and other officials from attending major sporting events.

RUSADA will have 21 days to challenge WADA’s decisions with the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Other interested parties could also appeal to the court in Lausanne, whose rulings will be binding on the International Olympic Committee and other sports bodies.

Russia has lashed back at the proposed sanctions, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov saying they amounted to one more Western effort to sideline Russia.

“There are those who want to put Russia in a defensive position accused of pretty much everything in every sphere of international life -- conflicts, economics, energy, gas pipelines, arms sales,” Lavrov has said.

However, RUSADA chief Yury Ganus has called the proposed punishments “justified.”

The statement comes after nine Russian athletes have filed lawsuits after L'Equipe's interview with Director-General of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) Yuri Ganus was published earlier in the week. The RUSADA head criticized the leadership of the All-Russia Athletic Federation and accused a number of athletes from Russia's Chuvash Republic of having prohibited blood transfusions under the protection of the regional authorities.

In 2015, the World Anti-Doping Agency accused Russia of multiple violations of doping regulations, which eventually led to restrictions against Russian athletes, including confiscation of several medals of Sochi and Rio Olympics and a ban on Russian athletes to compete under the national flag during the 2018 Winter Olympics.

Soon after securing a convincing victory on the beam in Stuttgart to overtake Belarusian Vitaly Scherbo’s record tally of 23 world medals, the 22-year-old Biles successfully defended her floor title to win medal number 25.

The four-time Olympic champion is now the owner of 19 gold medals across four championships against 12 for Scherbo, who competed in five world events between 1991 and 1996.

Making her final appearance of the week in front of a raucous crowd, Biles wasted no time as she landed a superb triple-twisting double back flip -- known as the Biles II – on her first pass.

Biles’s double layout with a half turn -- another skill named after her -- put her out of bounds for a 0.1 penalty but she did enough to post a winning score of 15.133.

The Americans took a one-two finish as Sunisa Lee finished with 14.133 for the silver medal, while Russian Angelina Melnikova came third.

Earlier, Biles delivered a polished routine on the beam before a full twisting double tuck dismount for an impressive 15.066.

Although Biles had twice before won the world beam title, in 2014 and 2015, it has not always been plain sailing for her on the apparatus.

Her slip on the landing of a front tucked somersault at the 2016 Rio Olympics meant she had to settle for a bronze in the event. Last year again, she dropped off the beam during the women’s all-around final at the world championships.

But she has regained her swagger this week, under the watchful eyes of balance beam coach Cecile Landi, and posted top scores in all four attempts -- qualifying, the team and all-around finals and Sunday’s apparatus final.

As another title-winning score was announced in the arena, Biles punched the air in jubilation before joining celebrations with the U.S. team.

Last year’s winner Liu Tingting of China took silver with 14.433, while team mate Li Shijia won the bronze.

Biles finished her campaign in Stuttgart with five gold medals from six events to mark ideal preparations for next year’s Tokyo Olympics.

A recent CNET article revealed how the Washington County Sheriff’s Office (WCSO) in Oregon uses Amazon’s Rekognition software to identify shoplifters.

An unnamed WCSO Deputy allegedly used Amazon’s Rekognition to search a 300,000-person mugshot database looking for a potential match.

What makes this so disturbing, is number one: a cop is using a private corporation’s software to identify people which has never been independently vetted for accuracy because “it is too sophisticated.’ And, secondly, each time a police officer investigates a petty crime; 300,000 people will have their faces scanned without a warrant.

Using facial recognition to identify people accused of petty crimes is a mirror image of what is happening in China.

China uses facial recognition to identify citizens accused of jaywalking and bans “discredited” citizens from taking buses and trains for unspecified behavioral crimes.

Law enforcement and retailers are creating a nationwide facial recognition database of everyone.

Yesterday, CNET warned that retail stores are secretly using facial recognition to identify shoppers and how the potential for abuse affects everyone.

With facial recognition, getting caught in one store could mean a digital record of your face is shared across the country. Stores are already using the technology for security purposes and can share that data — meaning that if one store considers you a threat, every business in that network could come to the same conclusion.

Creating secret watchlists of Americans is major concern that even CNET is acknowledging.

He also became the first Indian ever to have won both titles at the World Bodybuilding and Physique Sports Championship which was held in South Korea this year.

A total of 38 countries participated at the 11th World Bodybuilding and Physique Sports Championship (WBFF) and India bagged a tally of 23 medals in total, including 6 gold, 13 silver and 4 bronze medals in an event held between November 5 and November 10.

India secured the second position in the team championship category, followed by Thailand.

Thrilled to have won the coveted titles and represent India on a global platform, Natesan said he was training and bodybuilding for the past 10 years when he was selected for the Indian team, and began preparations for the international championship.

He shared that he added another feather to his cap earlier this year, by winning the International Bodybuilding and Fitness Federation Mr Asia 2019 title in Indonesia in September.

“After winning the Asian Bodybuilding and Physique Sports Championship earlier this year, I went on to participate in the World Championship. I am very happy to bring gold for my country India,” the Indian daily Indian Express quoted Natesan as saying.

Researchers say it marks a critical step towards a possible cure for humans - and clinical trials could begin as early as next year.

Current treatment focuses on the use of antiretroviral therapy, known as ART, which suppresses HIV replication, but does not eliminate the virus from the body.

It's not seen as a cure and requires life-long use because if the treatment is stopped, the virus can renew replication and fuel the development of AIDS.

But researchers at Temple University in Philadelphia and the University of Nebraska say they have come up with a revolutionary gene-editing tool.

The team injected mice with human bone barrow to mimic the immune system and say they were able to eliminate HIV in nine of the 21 animals.

Senior investigator Professor Kamel Khalili, an AIDS expert at Temple University, said: ""Our study shows treatment to suppress HIV replication and gene editing therapy, when given sequentially, can eliminate HIV from cells and organs of infected animals.""

His team used a technique called CRISPR-Cas9 that can snip faulty DNA with a harmless virus and has been likened to a pair of ""molecular scissors"".

It combines this with a recently developed therapeutic strategy known as LASER (long-acting slow-effective release) ART.

The technique targets viral ""sanctuaries"" - maintaining HIV replication at low levels for extended periods of time.

This also reduces the frequency of treatments.

The long-lasting medications were made possible by pharmacological changes in the chemical structure of antiretroviral drugs.

HIV rebound is directly attributed to the ability of the virus to integrate its DNA sequence into the genomes of cells of the immune system, where it lies dormant and beyond the reach of antiretroviral drugs.

In the study, published in Nature Communications, the modified drug was packaged into nanocrystals, which readily distribute to tissues where HIV is likely to be lying dormant.

From there, the nanocrystals, stored within cells for weeks, slowly release the drug.

Dr Khalili explained: ""We wanted to see whether LASER ART could suppress HIV replication long enough for CRISPR-Cas9 to completely rid cells of viral DNA.""

To test their idea, the researchers used mice engineered to produce human T cells susceptible to HIV infection.

Once infection was established, mice were treated with LASER ART and subsequently with CRISPR-Cas9.

At the end of the treatment period, mice were examined and analyses revealed complete elimination of HIV DNA in about one-third of HIV-infected mice.

Dr Khalili said: ""The big message of this work is that it takes both CRISPR-Cas9 and virus suppression through a method such as LASER ART, administered together, to produce a cure for HIV infection.

""We now have a clear path to move ahead to trials in non-human primates and possibly clinical trials in human patients within the year.""

Just over a generation ago the world was in the grip of AIDS hysteria, but thanks to modern drugs the picture has transformed.

Today it's more akin to a long-term condition than a certain death sentence and the number of new infections are declining in most parts of the world.

Earlier this year health secretary Matt Hancock promised by 2030 there would be no new cases of HIV in England.

Co senior investigator Dr Howard Gendelman, of Nebraska University, who developed LASER ART, said: ""This achievement could not have been possible without an extraordinary team effort that included virologists, immunologists, molecular biologists, pharmacologists, and pharmaceutical experts.

""Only by pooling our resources together were we able to make this groundbreaking discovery.""

In previous work, Dr Khalili's team used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to develop a novel gene editing and gene therapy delivery system aimed at removing HIV DNA from genomes harbouring the virus.

In rats and mice, they showed that the gene editing system could effectively excise large fragments of HIV DNA from infected cells, significantly impacting viral gene expression.

Similar to ART, however, gene editing cannot completely eliminate HIV on its own. The researchers now believed they have solved the problem.

785120,theirishtimes,"How to differentiate between what’s on offer and, more particularly, how to ensure your course has credibility in the labour market, is a major challenge.

But before you decide what you want to study, you should ask yourself about what type of programme you wish to follow: research or taught.

Taught postgraduate courses can be a continuation of your undergraduate studies or in an entirely new area. The length of a course usually determines its qualification. A higher certificate is generally a 30-credit programme over six modules. A graduate diploma is generally 60 credits and the master’s degree requires 90 credits. Taught masters often include a research component, possibly during the summer and, in some cases, in an industry setting.

Research masters, including MLitt’s, generally take 15 months to four years, depending on whether it’s full-time or part-time. If you choose a research-based course, explore the courses in your research area and the quality of the support and supervision offered. You can contact potential employers in your research area for views on the programme’s strengths.

Finding out the labour market’s opinion of the quality of support and supervision at this stage will pay dividends when engaging with potential employers near completion of your programme.

Some master’s programmes will facilitate an immediate transfer on to a PhD. A doctorate takes a minimum of three years. The topic is determined by your area of interest and those of your supervisor. Some PhDs are designed for the lone scholar under the direction of a single expert supervisor.

There are also structured PhDs where groups of students come together for transferable skills. Talk to the programme director to get help deciding which structure suits you and your work-style best.

Validity and recognition are central to choosing a programme. Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), a Department of Education and Skills agency responsible for the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), validates all qualifications from literacy programmes at level 1 to doctoral awards at level 10 within the Stare.

The validation of any qualification is central to its value; in Ireland this is usually seen in its relationship to the NFQ. The universities, the Technological University of Dublin and the Institutes of Technology make their own awards under legislation, or under “delegated awarding power” from QQI. These awards are on the NFQ for both undergraduate and postgraduate level and are listed by the higher education institutions on their websites.

QQI also makes awards in higher education mainly for programmes offered by private or independent higher education colleges. The database on www.qqi.ie lists higher education offerings from private institutions leading to awards at level 6 and upwards.

The qualifax.ie website has information on all postgrad opportunities in Ireland, including those not validated by QQI (for example, courses in Northern Ireland that fall outside the remit of QQI).

Qualifax currently lists 2,831 postgraduate programmes up from 2,714 in 2018 in 85 institutions in Ireland, including Northern Ireland institutions which provides 351 programmes.

They range from accounting in UCD to zoology in NUIG. Qualifax also lists some programmes at private colleges, where awards are on or aligned to the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ). There are another 100-plus courses offered by private colleges, with degrees awarded by external awarding bodies such as the universities in the UK.

Aside from programmes on Qualifax, highly reputable postgraduate degrees are offered online by top ranking universities worldwide. Unfortunately, there are also many worthless postgrad offerings online from colleges with little or no academic credibility.

So, for those considering programmes not validated by QQI, caveat emptor or buyer beware.

It can be difficult to verify the recognition of a qualification in another country. The European Network of Information Centres and National Academic Recognition Information Services (ENIC NARIC offices) in the relevant country is invaluable if you are considering studying abroad. See http://enic-naric.net

The Qualifax website is the source for all postgraduate courses in Ireland validated by QQI. You can search for programmes under a range of criteria, location, cost and key search words relevant to your area of interest.

For courses in NI and the UK, ucas.com has a comprehensive postgrad section. There’s a growing number of postgrad programmes through English in European universities – see eunicas.ie.

Online, highly reputable postgrads are offered by bodies such as the Open University and prestigious universities internationally.

“We see students selecting one of three types of course – depending on their own goals and motivation,” says Eilis O’Brien, director of communication at UCD.

“They fall into one of the following categories: progression students, who wish to become more expert in their bachelor subject; conversion students, who have a degree in one area but want to add skills and knowledge from another; and professional students, who want the qualification that goes with a particular graduate course.”

This third group generally have a career path mapped out, so the choice may be more about where and when. The first two groups start to think of postgraduate options around now in the final year of studies.

The high-quality Stem graduates emerging from universities and ITs have opportunities, but the competition has also increased, so many go on to graduate level to enhance their skill set.

Edel Carraway, programme internship manager for science at UCD, offers practical advice to final-year students thinking about taking a master’s or PhD: “Many students want their graduate degrees to open career doors and having an internship is very beneficial on your CV and can lead directly to a job offer from the placement company.” Many colleges offer internships as part of taught master’s, particularly in the Stem subjects.

“Seven of our science master’s degrees offer 12 to 15-week internships in semester three,” Carraway says. “Students are matched with suitable organisations and undertake a specific industry research project, which is carefully supervised and assessed.” This type of experience can be invaluable.

Science graduates with a background in life sciences or chemistry, and thinking about setting up on their own, may consider a hybrid conversion degree such as an MSc in biotechnology and business, including completing a business plan with a biotechnology company.

As a hub of biotechnology, Ireland is a good place for science graduates and an increasing number of international students are enrolling here. Biotechnology master’s and doctorate programmes with appropriate internships are also offered by DCU, UCC, NUIG and the TUD.

With 37 per cent of undergrads going on to postgrad, careers offices in colleges are crucial in advising undergraduates of their choices by running events to promote master’s and PhD options to their final-year students and preparing applications for graduate studies.",How to select the right postgraduate course for you,education,vocational education,1071

Through the investment, UCHealth said in a news release that it will improve access to behavioral health services through its primary care physicians and build a new inpatient behavioral health unit at the University of Colorado Hospital on CU’s Anschutz Medical Campus.

The emergency services found the vessel empty after launching a rescue operation this morning when it went up in flames.

They discovered the unnamed man’s wallet in the sea near the boat - and subsequently spoke to his partner who confirmed he had left the upmarket Marina Rubicon port in Playa Blanca on Lanzarote’s southern coast alone around 7.30am.

Civil Guard said the search operation involving police, coastguards and a local authority emergency response unit was continuing after firefighters put out the blaze.

Specialist Civil Guard divers are assisting as well as a coastguard helicopter, which took video footage of the upturned boat near the Pechiguera Lighthouse with thick black smoke rising from its hull as it was engulfed in flames.

One well-placed source confirmed: “The missing man is a British national. He hasn’t yet been located.”

The boat he was on has been named locally as Orca. The cause of the fire is not yet known.

One Brit holidaymaker commenting on the boat blaze wrongly claimed on social media the man on board had been found floating in the sea, despite the Civil Guard insisting last night he had yet to be located.

Civil Guard sources confirmed the missing Brit was 68 and not in his fifties as initially believed, and said that he lived on the island.

A spokesman for the force said: “With regards to the fire today that occurred on a boat 1.5 miles west of Pechiguera Lighthouse, an inspection and search carried out by Civil Guard divers inside and near the vessel has failed to find any sign of the only person on board.

“The remains of the gutted boat have been towed back to Marina Rubicon so Civil Guard investigators can start their probe into what happened.”

214976,france24,"Ryad Kramdi, AFP | Mass demonstration in the streets of Algiers on March 22, 2019.

Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Algiers again on Thursday to demand the resignation of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and changes to the political system after the powerful army called for the veteran leader to be removed.

The army chief of staff, Lieutenant General Ahmed Gaed Salah, on Tuesday asked the constitutional council to rule whether the ailing 82-year-old president is fit for office.

State radio said on Thursday that the council has not yet held any meeting so far to decide on Bouteflika’s fate.

Salah’s call received backing from the ruling FLN party and the main trade union, signalling that Bouteflika’s time was all but up after 20 years in power.

But leaders of the protest movement that has staged five weeks of peaceful demonstrations reject the army’s transition plan and demand the overthrow of the entire ruling elite.

In another blow to Bouteflika, one of his few remaining allies, leading businessman Ali Haddad, resigned as head of the influential FCE business forum, a resignation letter seen by Reuters showed.

Haddad, who was awarded large public works projects by the government and has investments in the media, has helped to fund Bouteflika’s election campaigns over the years.

Hundreds of Algerians rallied again on Thursday to criticise not just Bouteflika but also the political system, which for decades has been built around veterans of the 1954-1962 war of independence against France, military officers and business tycoons.

“Thieves, you have destroyed the country,” they chanted.

“Our battle will continue until we get rid of the system,” said architect Belaid Hakimi, 36,

The General Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA), long a staunch supporter of the president, has also said it supported the army call for Bouteflika to step down.

In an unusual development suggesting further disarray in Bouteflika’s inner circle, the owner of a TV station close to the government, Ali Fodil, was detained by the authorities for several hours on Thursday, his Echorouk TV channel reported.

He was later released on the order of the general prosecutor. Officials had no immediate comment on the matter. On Wednesday evening, Echorouk broadcast a programme critical of Bouteflika’s influential younger brother Said. Another TV station, Ennahar, said Fodil had been detained by intelligence personnel.

Any ruling by the constitutional council on Bouteflika’s future would have to be ratified by a two-thirds majority in the two houses of parliament.

Under the constitution, the chairman of parliament’s upper house, Abdelkader Bensalah, would serve as caretaker president for at least 45 days after Bouteflika’s departure.

But even if Bouteflika quits, there is no clear long-term successor.

And even if both sides dig in, no Algerian wants to risk returning to the dark days of the 1990s, when the army’s cancellation of elections that Islamists were on the verge of winning triggered a civil war that killed 200,000 people.",Algeria's protesters expand focus to political elite beyond Bouteflika,politics,political crisis,470
72574,breitbart,"A report released at the Commonwealth Foundation calls attention to government union leaders’ campaigns in the states to bolster their power over workers.

“In many states, union leaders are using their considerable lobbying resources to slow legislation that would enforce Janus and to pass union-friendly bills,” said Charles Mitchell, president and CEO for the Commonwealth Foundation, in a press statement.

Union leaders are attempting to counter the increasing number of lawsuits alleging they have contrived obstacles to workers’ ability to leave government unions they were once forced to join and to collect refunds of past fees.

The labor unions’ campaign mimics that of other leftwing groups, such as the abortion industry, that claim a Supreme Court ruling in their favor is “settled law,” yet use their influence in state legislatures to undermine a potential Court ruling that is not to their advantage.

“According to Ballotpedia, as of early August 2019, 102 Janus-related state bills were introduced and seven bills backed by labor leaders were enacted,” states the Commonwealth Foundation’s report, adding:

For example, both the state of Washington’s House Bill 1575 and California’s Senate Bill 846 declare government unions are not required to refund union fees forcibly collected from workers prior to the Janus decision.

Oregon had ten new labor bills in 2019, including House Bill 3009, in which public safety unions were successful in securing a win to maintain their agency fees by replacing them with “reasonable fees and costs for representation that are unrelated to the negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement.”

“In other words, the law is an illegal Janus workaround to maintain the union’s cash flow from agency fees and limit employees’ freedom of association—and is thus ripe for a court challenge,” states the report.

Republican Gov. Chris Sununu vetoed New Hampshire’s Senate Bill 18, which proposed voluntary union payments, the report notes.

“Continuing the payroll deduction for a month after a worker has chosen not to continue union membership falls outside the spirit of the Janus ruling and could potentially expose the state, counties and municipalities to litigation,” he said regarding his decision.

As the Commonwealth Foundation reports, union leaders in Oregon and California were also successful in codifying the practice of “release time” for union officials. The laws passed in these states require employers to grant union officials paid time off to conduct union business during their work day.

Legislation in other union-friendly states seeks to provide public sector employees’ private information to unions to assist in organizing, and to unionize new classes of workers with or without their knowledge or consent.

“This report warns that a Supreme Court decision is in danger of being undermined by politically savvy actors at the state level,” Mitchell said. “Advocates for workers cannot rest on their laurels and expect public employees’ newly-restored rights to be respected. States must pass laws that enforce and protect the Janus ruling.”",Labor Unions Strike Back Against Janus Ruling in States,labour,unions,455

Over many decades, in times of war and peace, Mark Esper has answered the call of duty. He’s never failed. He hails from Uniontown, Pennsylvania — the hometown of his personal hero, the legendary former Secretary of Defense and a great one, George Marshall.

Mark attended the United States Military Academy at West Point. Graduated in 1986, receiving a commission in the infantry.

Soon, he earned his tab — Ranger Tab — and fought with the famed 101st Airborne Division in the Gulf War. He was awarded the Bronze Star and the Combat Infantryman Badge for his service. Brave guy. They all told me he was a brave guy. I knew that anyway.

In total, Mark served in our nation’s military for 21 years. He completed his final active-duty assignment right here at the Pentagon on the Army staff and then returned six years later as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Negotiations Policy.

Over his career, Mark has advanced our national security in a variety of other government and private sector roles. He has worked in both houses of Congress, advising lawmakers. I can see he had some talent because he won — was it 98 to what? No, you got 90, right? Can you believe this? I don’t believe it. I heard a “Ninety.” Ninety to eight, right? (Applause.) I don’t know. I haven’t heard that sound in a long time, Mark. (Laughter.) Now I’m worried. Ninety to eight. Wow.

He served as Vice President of Raytheon. Along the way, Mark earned a master’s degree at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government and a PhD at George Washington University.

In 2017, Mark was sworn in as Secretary of the United States Army, a position in which he earned universal admiration and respect. Tremendous respect.

At the Department of Defense, Secretary Esper will work with more than 2 million service members and hundreds of thousands of civilian employees all dedicated to one critical mission: the defense of the nation and of this great nation’s people.

I have absolute confidence that Mark will ensure that our incredible military is fully prepared to deter conflict and to defeat any foe. No enemy can match the awesome might of the American Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and the United States Marines.

We had a budget approved when I first came in. Billions and billions of dollars more than it was previously, in the previous administration: $700 billion. Then I went to $716 billion. And I won’t even tell you what this one is. I can only tell you it’s even more. Because we have rebuilt things that nobody ever even thought of rebuilding. We’ve added the greatest planes in the world, the greatest missiles in the world. We’ve upgraded our nuclear very, very powerfully, including new. We never want to have to use it. Pray to God that we never have to use it. But we have the best in the world in every aspect of military.

The sight of American warriors brings solace into the hearts of our friends and strikes fear into the hearts of our enemies. Our military today is more powerful, by far, than ever before. And three years ago, we could not have said that, could we, Mark?

We’re giving our warfighters the tools they need to fight and win with overwhelming force. After years and years of budget cuts and all of the things that they’ve been doing to set us back with our military, we have more than made up for all of it.

We’re building new tanks and ships and submarines and planes and missile systems to ensure that our warriors operate with unrivaled capability in conflict. Any battlefield will be a battlefield on which we win.

We have given our service members their largest pay raise in nearly a decade. And under this administration, we have faced the challenge of our time with clear eyes, fresh thinking, and bold determination.

Our first priority is always the safety and sovereignty of our nation and our citizens. Here at home, we have deployed military forces to confront the grave national security crisis on our southern border. And I want to thank all of the great military leaders for the help you’ve given us on our southern border.

And, as you know, Mexico has now deployed 21,000 troops, which is something they’ve never done before. And they’ve been a tremendous help. Tremendous difference in the numbers — very rapidly. And we want to thank the country of Mexico and the President.

No nation can be safe or secure that fails to control its borders. In Syria and Iraq, thanks to the bravery of our warriors and their allies, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent and just absolutely destroyed. And we did it in a very quick moment of time. As soon as I said, “I want to do it and I want to do it fast,” our military kicked in and it happened very, very quickly.

Today, we stand not far from where terrorists attacked the Pentagon on 9/11, claiming 184 precious lives. We will never forget the immortal sacrifice of those American patriots. We vow to do whatever it takes to protect our homeland, to safeguard our people from the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, and to preserve American freedom.

Around the world, America faces new threats and strategic rivals, it seems like all the time. We have met this competition with unmatched confidence, purpose, and resolve. We talk to all of them and they talk to us with great, great respect. They respect our country so much more than they have for many, many decades. Right now, they respect us more than they have in many, many years. And it’s only going to get more so.

We are ensuring American dominance across every warfighting domain — land, air, sea, cyber, and now space. That is why, under Secretary Esper’s leadership, we will — as Mike and Mark have already said, but it’s so exciting to say. And whenever I make a speech, people start going wild. They stand up and they clap, and I can’t sit them down. And I have to wait because I say, “We’re launching the United States Space Force.” They go absolutely wild. They understand that’s where it’s going to be at. And we’re going to be there, and we’re going to be there in every way that you can.

As we aim ever higher, I know the men and women of this department will never let up and never rest easy. Together, we will fulfill our sacred mission to protect the greatest nation in the history of the world: the United States of America. With unyielding strength, we will defend our country, we will defend our people, and we will proudly defend our great American flag.

Secretary Esper, congratulations again to you and your family. This is an incredible day in the life and fabled history of the United States.

Secretary of Defense, do you ever see that, looking into — do you ever see that one? As I watch all of these great men and women — you’re going to do a great job, I have no doubt. Absolutely no doubt. (Applause.) No doubt.

We cannot wait to see all that you will achieve for our nation as the new Secretary of Defense. I want to thank everybody for being here. Very special people. God bless you. God bless our military. And God bless America.

Thank you very much everybody. (Applause.) Thank you.",President Trump Participates in Honors Welcome Ceremony at the Pentagon…,human interest,ceremony,1746

742401,theindependent,"What do you need to think about when buying a swimming cap? Firstly, consider about what you’ll be using it for. Is it to protect your hair from chlorine, while keeping it as dry as possible? Or are you looking for something super-tight and streamlined to help you swim faster in the pool? Or does the pool you take your kids to insist they wear a swim hat, so you just want something that’s comfy and good value.

There are different swimming cap styles to cater to all these needs; there's even thermal, neoprene hats to keep your head warm if you’re cold water swimming in the sea or lakes in winter. Most performance swim hats are made with silicone making them stretchy enough to work for all head sizes, though if you have long hair with lots of volume, you should look for a specifically-designed extra-large cap, so it won’t slip back or fall off when you push off from the wall.

It’s also worth thinking about how vigorously you plan to swim, as gentle breaststroke will require a less fitted hat than fast front crawl or butterfly, especially if you’re doing racing dives or forceful tumble turns. We’ve included a mix of brands and some children’s options too. The hats were tested in a leisure centre swimming pool.

We were impressed with this Silicone Moulded Cap from Speedo. It was stretchy enough to get on and off easily, and when on it held in place really well during fast swimming, including tumble turns and racing dives. It felt really comfortable to wear, didn’t snag our hair and held up in repeated sessions without remotely losing its original shape. The fabric felt thick and durable, as if the hat would last a long time. And we liked the bright colour, which would provide extra visibility during summer sea swimming. It's also available in a range of other colours.

The Super Flex Silicone Cap from Aussie swim brand Vorgee is especially designed for swimmers with longer hair, and it promises to keep your hair dry and protected from chlorine. Our tester with long hair did find it kept some of their hair dry on top, though the sides and back still got wet, perhaps that was due to faster front crawl swimming and maybe if you stuck to breaststroke, your hair would stay dry. The cap was comfy and felt like it was good value for money. It's also available in blue, black, pink and red.

Our six-year-old tester got very excited over this Batman swimming cap from Zoggs. It was a tight fit and not that easy to get on or off, especially compared to the softer fabric style that young kids are usually used to, but once it was on they were super happy with it. Especially the pointy bat ears, which they kept proudly touching. The cap held in place really well during swimming, both lessons and playtime, and was compatible with goggles. It felt like a hat that would motivate even the most reluctant young swimmers into the water. The range includes Wonder Women, Aquaman and Superman caps.

If you have dreadlocks, extensions, an Afro or just really long hair, wearing a regular swimming hat can be a pain – even if you do manage to stretch it to fit, it will probably rise up the first time you push off the wall. Soul Cap has been designed with extra fabric to avoid that happening. And we found it did a really good job, holding in place well even with diving, faster swimming and strong pushing off from the side.

As you might expect from a cap that namechecks the world’s greatest ever swimming Olympian, the Michael Phelps cap is designed for racing, keeping your head as streamlined and therefore speedy as possible in the pool. Consequently, it was tighter than the other caps on test and slighter harder to get on and off, though we didn’t find it a massive problem; it stayed in place perfectly while we swam and dived in. This is best suited to swimmers with shorter hair.

One of the worst things about cold water swimming, even in a wetsuit, is the brain freeze you get when you dive under the water. But this swim hat from triathlon brand, Orca, puts paid to that as it’s made from neoprene, the material used for wetsuits, to a thickness of 3mm. We found it kept our head really warm, and it was comfy to wear, though we did need to mess around with the chin strap to get the tightness right initially. Orca do a version without a chin strap though if you’re worried about that, though the strap would keep do a good job of keeping the cap in place if you were swimming in choppy seas. Available in sizes S/M and L/XL.

Younger kids don’t need to be fast or streamlined when swimming, they just need to be comfortable and happy in the water, and this Junior Fab Cap from Vorgee will help them be just that. It’s made from a soft fabric that is easy to stretch over their hair without any painful snagging. And they’ll be able to pull this cap off easily themselves. It will eventually lose its shape with repeated wear, but it should give you at least a year of regular wear first, if not more. It's also available in a range of other colours.

This is a great value hat from Nabaiji, Decathlon’s swimwear brand. It’s comfortable to wear and doesn’t stick to your hair, but it is a smallish fit, so it wouldn’t be a great choice for those with larger heads or lots of hair. It stayed in place relatively well and would be good for keeping hair out of your eyes, though due to its fabric nature your hair does get wet, so we wouldn’t recommend it for those who want to keep their hair as dry as possible. Fabric caps will lose their stretch over time, too. This is also available in pink, black and navy.

We liked this cap from Aqua Sphere, finding it stretchy and comfortable to swim in, even for longer sessions, when some hats can start to push a little on your head. It was easy to get on and off, didn’t snag our hair and it felt like a decent quality product for the price.

“That looks like something the Queen would wear” said one of our young testers when we put this on at the pool, and it does definitely have more of a vintage fashion style than the usual sporty, streamlined caps on sale. We thought this would be more suited to sedate breaststroke lengths than hammering up and down the pool, yet it did stay put surprisingly well for faster swimming, and only moved a little with more vigorous dives. It's available in different colourways.

Like many children at the moment, our young tester is mad for unicorns, and they greeted this hat from Nabaiji with a lot of glee. It wasn’t as tight as some silicone caps, but it was a lot harder to put on than a fabric cap would be, though our tester found it comfy to wear once it was on. It kept their hair drier than a fabric cap, but water did get in around the ears and hairline. It's also available in blue.

We rated the Speedo Plain Moulded Silicone Cap most highly for adults, as it was really stretchy and comfy to wear, and it felt durable. The Vorgee Super Flex Silicone Cap was a great cap too and good value for money, while the Michael Phelps Race Cap was the best for contest swimming. For kids, we would recommend the Zoggs superhero series and the Vorgee Junior Fab Cap.

682682,theguardian,"The Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley have announced legislation that would strip Medals of Honor from US soldiers who carried out the Wounded Knee massacre, killing hundreds of mostly unarmed Native Americans.

A House bill on the subject was introduced in June by representatives including Deb Haaland, a New Mexico Democrat who is one of the first female Native American US lawmakers.

“The horrifying acts of violence against hundreds of Lakota men, women, and children at Wounded Knee should be condemned, not celebrated with Medals of Honor,” said Warren, from Massachusetts, who is campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination.

“The Remove the Stain Act acknowledges a profoundly shameful event in US history, and that’s why I’m joining my House colleagues in this effort to advance justice and take a step toward righting wrongs against Native peoples.”

In a statement, Haaland said the act was “about more than just rescinding Medals of Honor from soldiers who served in the US 7th Cavalry and massacred unarmed Lakota women and children [in 1890] – it’s also about making people aware of this country’s history of genocide of American Indians.”

Donald Trump has referenced Wounded Knee in mocking Warren’s claim to Native American heritage.

The senators’ announcement came on Wednesday, a day before Thanksgiving, the federal holiday commemorating a 1621 harvest meal shared by Native Americans and Pilgrims. Thanksgiving has increasingly drawn criticism for glossing over the disastrous impact of white settlement on Native Americans.

Since 1970, the United American Indians of New England organisation has held a National Day of Mourning on Thanksgiving day, to remember “the genocide of millions of native people, the theft of native lands and the relentless assault on native culture”, according to the Associated Press.

The National Day of Mourning takes place in Plymouth, Massachusetts, an early place of European settlement.

Wounded Knee, described by the Washington Post as “one of most shameful and bloody acts of violence against indigenous people in American history”, occurred on 29 December 1890.

Chief Big Foot, who led the Minneconjou Lakota, was guiding his people to refuge in South Dakota when US soldiers stopped them. The group surrendered and was taken to Wounded Knee Creek, “surrounded by 470 soldiers and their formidable artillery”, the Post wrote.

While exact details of the massacre have proved difficult to determine, it is believed there was a dispute while soldiers were trying to disarm the chief’s men. It is also thought a gunshot prompted American forces to attack. Between 150 and 400 Native Americans were killed. Historians agree most of the victims were women and children.

Twenty members of the 7th cavalry involved in Wounded Knee received the Medal of Honor, which is described by the Army as “the nation’s highest medal for valor in combat that can be awarded to members of the armed forces”.

A large number of the medals were awarded for “gallantry” and “bravery” even though there are few details of purported acts of heroism, the Post noted.

Maj Gen Nelson A Miles, an army commander, wrote of the incident: “I have never heard of a more brutal, cold-blooded massacre than that at Wounded Knee.”

According to a letter cited by the Post, Miles described the victims as “women with little children on their backs, and small children powder-burned by the men who killed them being so near as to burn the flesh and clothing with the powder of their guns, and nursing babies with five bullet holes through them”.

While the Medal of Honor was granted more loosely in the 19th century, scholars have noted that the number of Wounded Knee recipients is high. Antietam, an 1862 civil war battle considered the “bloodiest day in US history”, also led to 20 awards.

Native Americans have long pushed for the revocation of medals awarded to Wounded Knee soldiers. Since 1997, the National Congress of American Indians has greenlighted resolutions requesting the removal of medals.

Congress formally apologized in 1990, stating “deep regret on behalf of the United States to the descendants of the victims and survivors and their respective tribal communities”. But, the Associated Press reported, lawmakers did not offer any type of reparations.",Warren introduces bill to strip Medals of Honor for Wounded Knee massacre,"conflict, war and peace",massacre,676
574452,tass,"ARKHANGELSK, December 2. /TASS/. Specialists of the Russian Arctic Nature Park jointly with the Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Geography began the Clean Arctic project to analyze the effect of oil products’ pollution on soils, vegetation and the ecosystem’s other components on the Franz Josef Land Archipelago. The project will continue for three years, the national park’s Director Alexander Kirilov told TASS.

""We’ve begun the Clean Arctic project on Franz Josef Land, which will continue for three years,"" he said. ""Scientists will analyze distribution of oil products in the seasonal melt layer in the Arctic.""

""Researchers will see how much oil products affect components of the ecosystem in high latitudes,"" he continued. ""The results will be applied to plan further revegetation of those territories.""

Cleaning effort on Franz Josef Land has been underway since 2012, and between 2012 and 2017 more than 45,000 tonnes of waste was removed from the archipelago. Cleaning works have been practically finalized on the Alexandra Land, the Hooker, Heiss and Graham Bell Islands, and cleaning work should yet be carried out on the Rudolf and Hofmann Islands.

""Polluted areas still remain in places, where fuel used to be stored <...> and thus quite many oil products still remain in the soil,"" the Clean Arctic project’s leader, geologist Dmitry Kryukov noted.

As part of the project, specialists will take soil samples and compare them with ""clean"" areas. ""Thus, the studies will let us see how the environment may change under the effect of such pollutants,"" Alexander Dobryansky of the Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Geography commented. The first samples have been taken on the Alexandra Land.

Conditions on the islands, where the cleaning took place, are different, and thus specialists used different methods to revegetate the soils. The studies will also show how effective the chosen methods were and what impact they have on the ecosystem.

Results of the studies on the Arctic islands will serve as an input into remote analysis of pollution, including by radar imaging. It is very hard to receive good pictures of the high-latitudinal Arctic from satellites as the territory practically always is under layers of clouds, the expert said.

""When we study the territory, we are gaining references in order to use space imaging to decipher the objects we need: pollution and structure of landscapes,"" he explained. ""But in order to use radar imaging, which works regardless of clouds, we need to have a database of spectral images in different shooting ranges.""

""Sets of references and comparison with how objects are represented in optical images will be used to develop a method of decoding radar imaging for the high-Arctic conditions,"" he added.

This method could be employed both on Franz Josef Land’s islands and on other islands as well as on the mainland with similar conditions: for example, on Novaya Zemlya and Severnaya Zemlya archipelagoes.

""The technologies could be used practically along the entire northern shore of continental Russia,"" Dobryansky pointed out. ""In the Lena’s estuary in Yakutia, for example, there is still lots of environmental damage. The work there is supported financially by the Rosneft company.""

The Russian Arctic National Park is Russia’s northernmost and biggest nature reserve, which covers an area of 8.8 million hectares. It was established on June 15, 2009. The Park includes a northern part of the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago’s Severny Island and the entire Franz Josef Land Archipelago.",Scientists study oil products pollution on Franz Josef Land,environment,environmental pollution,552

As usual in matters such as these, California is leading the way.

On the first day of classes at Denair Middle School near Modesto, science teacher Luis Davila Alvarado handed out a worksheet from a transgender advocacy group titled ""The Gender Unicorn"" asking students about their ""gender identity,"" ""gender expression"" and their sexual and emotional attractions.

These are children. And yet the teacher did not ask permission to hand the worksheet out. Most parents were outraged. The school estimated about 50 children received the worksheet. It turns out Alvarado was educating the children about his own life. He declared he rejects the term ""Mr."" and prefers to be addressed with the newfangled ""Mx.,"" pronounced ""Mix."" A school official quickly put a stop to it, but the damage was done.

In California, waiting until middle school for this boatload of propaganda is actually inappropriate!

In May, the California State Board of Education established a set of guidelines insisting schools should begin discussing ""gender identity"" in kindergarten . ""While students may not fully understand the concepts of gender expression and identity,"" the guidelines insist, ""some children in kindergarten and even younger have identified as transgender or understand they have a gender identity that is different from their sex assigned at birth."" Schools apparently must leap to address the ""harm of negative gender stereotypes.""

Public schools aren't just undermining parents with the curriculum. When children ""decide"" they ""might"" be transgender, parents better not object, or else they will be treated as a threat to their own children's well-being.

On Aug. 12, USA Today published a chilling op-ed from Jay Keck, a parent in the Chicago suburbs, about how his autistic teenage daughter — who showed ""no signs"" of being unhappy with her gender — suddenly decided in 2016 that she was male and wanted to be addressed with male pronouns.

She first ""came out"" at school, and Keck says the school immediately addressed her with male pronouns and provided access to a gender-neutral bathroom. When Keck and his wife found out, they insisted the school address their daughter by her legal name — and were ignored. They met with an assistant superintendent, who asserted the school had to, as USA Today wrote, ""follow the law"" — a nonbinding directive from the Obama administration, which was repealed by Team Trump.

According to Keck, surprise, surprise: The American Civil Liberties Union has sent threatening letters to schools telling them that ""students have the constitutional right to share or withhold information about their sexual orientation or gender identity from their parents, teachers, and other parties.""

Then the real nightmare kicked in. Put yourself in the position of the Keck family.

""My daughter told me that the school social worker was advising her about halfway houses,"" he said. ""The social worker confirmed this when I scheduled a meeting with him to discuss it. This felt like a horrifying attempt to encourage our daughter to run away from home.""

Keck had his daughter evaluated by a psychologist approved by the school district. He said, ""He told us it was very clear that our daughter's sudden transgender identity was driven by her underlying mental health conditions, but would only share his thoughts off the record because he feared the potential backlash."" When his daughter graduated high school, parental wishes that her birth name would be announced were again ignored.

This growing gender-bending orthodoxy is what Pope Benedict called the ""dictatorship of relativism,"" or, if you prefer, ""the tyranny of tolerance."" Dissent — even from parents — is being condemned as bigotry, cruelty and hate speech.

This will not stop until the nuclear family is destroyed. Or until parents stand up as one and declare a commitment to destroy this movement.

72148,breitbart,"The Torah typically refers to the first five books of the Old Testament (the “five books of Moses”). However, it can also refer generally to the whole Bible, plus the entire body of Jewish law.

Booker was reacting to President Trump’s statement this week that American Jews who voted for Democrats, after they supported anti-Israel and antisemitic members of their party, were “disloyal” to themselves.

The New Jersey senator told an interviewer in Iowa that Trump was not displaying the Jewish values of tzedakah (charity) and chesed (kindness). The Times of Israel reported:

“I know Jewish values… tzedakah, chesed… there’s an idea in Judaism about kindness and decency and mercy,” he said in a video posted to Twitter by the politics site Iowa Starting Line. “These ideals are not being evidenced by the president of the United States.” The New Jersey lawmaker added that Democrats “are no less disloyal to this country” than Republicans are. “The word tzedakah — I know you’re not a Torah scholar — it not only is used to talk about charity and decency and mercy, it’s actually the word for justice as well. We need to get back to that, to being good to each other,” he said to the interviewer.

In response, Rabbi Boteach, a Breitbart News contributor who befriended Booker at Oxford University before their political falling out over the Obama administration’s hostile approach to Israel, issued a statement:

In response to Cory Booker’s comments quoting the Torah and Jewish values to assail President Trump, I would remind him that firstly, “I was the one who taught him the Torah he knows” and what I always emphasized to him is that Judaism’s highest value is protection and preservation of life. This is something that Cory unfortunately violated in the extreme when he betrayed the American Jewish community by voting for the Iran nuclear deal for political gain. Jewish values are about having core convictions that do not change based on any external benefits, especially when genocide is at stake. While I absolutely agree that President Trump’s words – and not only actions – should be consistent with Jewish values, there can be no question that in action he has been the most supportive President for Israel for security and legitimacy in the history of the United States. Cory, sadly, has gone in the opposite direction, catering to left-wing extremists who sadly despise Israel and the Jewish people for no legitimate reason. Cory has condemned the moving of the American embassy to Jerusalem, voted against the Taylor Force Act in committee, which would simply have stopped Palestinian terrorists from being payed to murder Jews, and most famously he voted for the Iran deal and refused to even once condemn Iran’s genocidal promises to annihilate Israel. It is not right for Cory to use the Torah – that I taught him as my Student President at Oxford – as a way to try and garner Jewish support while refusing to support Israel. The Torah is not to be weaponized politically. Nor is it to be used for political gain in contravention of core convictions. You cannot quote from the Torah about love and kindness, all of which I taught Cory in hundreds of hours of Torah learning at Oxford, while not condemning Iran’s plans to annihilate six million Jews in Israel, just as the Germans murdered six million of our brethren in Europe.

Booker is far behind the lead pack in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.

""We send our support to Tammy and reiterate our call for Twitter and other social companies to clamp down on this level of abuse. This is a call to action - we want to know what they are going to do to tackle this insidious problem.""

Kick it Out, who were formed 26 years ago this week, are now seeking dialogue with Twitter but have had no response from the social media giant following earlier calls to tackle the issue and expect Government action to be needed in order to spark a change.

The Super Cup incident comes a day after Queens Park Rangers called on Uefa to do more to tackle racism with their U18s having abandoned a match in Spain with several of their players having suffered racial abuse.

The west Londoners had called in Kick it Out to provide educational training and establish a protocol on what the players and staff should do ahead of the trip in case they encountered such abuse.

In response to QPRs calls, Uefa said: ""The fight to eliminate racism, discrimination and intolerance is a major priority of the organisation"".",Tammy Abraham abuse after missing Chelsea penalty sees Kick It Out call on Twitter to outline plan to tackle online racism,society,discrimination,304
71744,breitbart,"“I’ll drive it home with a sledgehammer here: America’s immigration system is first and foremost, for the benefit of America. Period,” USCIS acting director Ken Cuccinelli told Breitbart News.

The purpose of immigration policy was raised during a White House press conference on Monday when Cuccinelli unveiled the new “Public Charge” regulation which will help deny green cards to foreign people who are likely to need welfare and aid from taxpaying Americans.

Cuccinelli’s pro-American statement came shortly after a sharply ideological question by a CBS reporter:

Almost as long the public charge rules has been in the effect since the late 1800s, there also has been — almost as long — the words at the base of the Statue of Liberty that read “Give us your tired, your poor.” You are implementing a public charge rule for the first time. Is that sentiment, “Give us your tired, your poor,” still operative in the United States? Or should those words come down, should the plaque come down off the Statue or Liberty?’

The 1886 statue was inspired by the Union victory in the civil war and was subsequently built in France. The statue is named “Liberty Enlightening the World” to emphasize the statue’s message — that Americans’ freedoms show the way forward for other people and countries.

But that pro-freedom message has been buried under a pro-migration drumbeat by pro-migration advocacy groups and friendly media outlets.

In 1903, 17 years after the statue was opened, pro-migration advocates added a plaque with a pro-migration poem, saying “Give me your tired, your poor/Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” The plaque was part of a broader immigration debate, which ended in 1924 when Congress sharply reduced the inflow of new migrants, so allowing Americans to win a rapid rise in their standard of living from roughly 1945 to 1970. The period of rapid income growth ended several years after Congress expanded immigration in 1965.

In 1986, the plaque was moved from the statue to a museum inside the statue. But the plaque is still being used by pro-migration groups to help change the public’s understanding of the statue from its pro-U.S. “Enlightening the World” message to their anti-U.S. “nation of immigrants” message.

In the White House press conference, Cuccinelli first dodged the CBS question about the plaque, saying “Well, I’m certainly not prepared to take anything down off the Statue of Liberty.”

“We have a long history of being one of the most welcoming nations in the world on a lot of bases, whether you be an asylee, whether you be coming in here to join your family or immigrating yourself,” he added.

But a few minutes later, Cuccinelli provided the answer to the statue question when he told another reporter that “the entire legal immigration system is designed by Congress for the benefit of America.”

In a subsequent phone call with Breitbart News, Cuccinelli expanded his answer:

That plaque was added after the Statue of Liberty. It wasn’t part of the Statue of Liberty, and you can talk to National Park Service about that. But there’s no question our immigration system, as this President has frankly and without apology proclaimed, is for the benefit of this country. It does have collateral benefits to the rest of the world. But first and foremost, Americans’, American immigration policy is about America, and making us stronger in the future. And this rule is consistent with that policy, and frankly that tradition. By ensuring that people who come here won’t eventually be people who would go on welfare, or likely to go on welfare, we strengthen both America and America’s immigration policy, and that is the goal of this rule … I’ll drive it home with a sledgehammer here, America’s immigration system is first and foremost, for the benefit of America. Period.

Cuccinelli’s statement has always been at the center of Americans’ immigration policy, said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. “The idea of letting [only] people in who can pay their owns bills not only predates the Statue of Liberty, it predates the United States itself,” he told Breitbart News, adding:

The renewed focus on the public charge rule was caused by President Bill Clinton’s decision to loosen the rule, Krikorian said. The immediate “purpose of this new rule is to overturn Orwellian rules by the Clinton administration which narrowed the definition of welfare as much as possible, limiting it only to cash [aid] so that if you were on food stamps, on Medicaid, living in public housing, you would still be considered self-sufficient under those dishonest rules,” he said.

When asked about Cuccinelli’s use of “America” instead of “Americans,” Krikorian replied:

In a sense [the use of ‘America’] is sort of true … But that overriding purpose still leaves the question of which Americans should be helped by immigration law? Every immigration policy can help some Americans and hurt others, so the point of politics is to work that out. Current immigration policy helps monied interests at the expense of poor Americans, and I suppose you can decide that either way but I root for poor Americans … The question is who loses and who gains? Which Americans are being helped and which Americans are being hurt? And who do we think is more important? I think it is more important not to hurt poor Americans [with massive waves of cheap labor] than to provide a very small [financial] benefit to other Americans who own shares in Koch Foods which is using immigration for its [cost-saving] benefit.

However, many pro-migration advocates are ignoring the impact on Americans, he said. “Immigration policy is supposed to benefit Americans, but the advocacy groups seem to focus almost exclusively on whether immigration policies are good for foreigners who are not even here yet. Who are you rooting for? The anti-border people seem to be rooting for foreigners instead of Americans.”

Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or university. This total includes about 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business, health care, engineering, science, software, or statistics.

But the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of approximately 1.5 million white-collar visa workers — including about 1 million H-1B workers and spouses — and around 500,000 blue-collar visa workers.

The government also prints out more than one million work permits for foreigners, tolerates about eight million illegal workers, and does not punish companies for employing the hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants who sneak across the border or overstay their legal visas each year.

This policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth and returns for investors because it transfers wages to investors and ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions.

This policy of flooding the market with cheap, foreign, white-collar graduates and blue-collar labor also shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors, even as it also widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, and hurts children’s schools and college educations.

The cheap-labor economic strategy also pushes Americans away from high-tech careers and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.

The labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the Heartland to the coastal cities, explodes rents and housing costs, shrivels real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech, labor-intensive workplaces.",'Statue of Liberty' Question: 'Our Immigration System Is for the Benefit of This Country',society,immigration,1195
202916,fortune,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a drug for the first time that aims at treating postpartum depression in mothers.

Dubbed Zulresso, the medication is administered by a continuous intravenous (IV) infusion for 60 hours. According to the FDA, the IV must be administered in a health care facility because of fears of “serious harm due to sudden loss of consciousness.” Patients also need to be accompanied by another adult when they have their children with them during treatment.

Despite those concerns, the FDA found Zulresso, which is owned by Sage Therapeutics, to be effective in treating postpartum depression. In two clinical studies, women with either severe postpartum depression or moderate postpartum depression saw marked improvements in their depressive symptoms compared to a placebo group. The effects were apparent after the first infusion and were still there at the 30-day follow-up appointment, according to the FDA.

Postpartum depression is a major depressive disorder that can affect women both during pregnancy and after childbirth. It’s often associated with varying levels of sadness, an inability to feel pleasure, and in severe cases, suicidal thoughts. In some cases, mothers may have thoughts of harming their children.

Whether Zulresso will actually be used in widespread cases remains to be seen. The 60-hour treatment window in a healthcare facility for a mother who’s raising one or more children might be difficult to accommodate. And according to CNN, a single treatment could range from $20,000 to $35,000, making the treatment cost prohibitive to some mothers.",FDA Approves First Drug Treatment for Postpartum Depression,health,health treatment,248
700664,theguardianuk,"I am sitting at a huge table at the Ministry of Culture in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, as officials explain what sounds like a wonderful opportunity. There’s currently an international call-out to find someone to run a gallery in the country, one housing the world’s second-largest collection of Russian avant garde art. What an amazing job, I think – raising the profile of a museum that could turn out to be the Louvre of central Asia.

But the dream job may not be quite so dreamy. The next day, at a godawful hour, I get up to fly to Nukus in northern Uzbekistan, where this “museum of forbidden art” is located. En route, I blearily note that even the guidebooks can find little to say about this “unappealing city”. It seems the only other reason people venture there is for a spot of “disaster tourism”. The Aral Sea, once the fourth largest inland sea, has shrunk because of Soviet irrigation systems and chemicals pumped into the water. All the fish are dead. There’s a horribly photogenic landscape of rusting boats on a dried-up seabed that looks like a lunar surface. Toxic dust blows through the area – there are high rates of infant mortality and cancer.

Still, I am here for the art, invited by the Ministry of Culture. Uzbekistan is opening up and has lifted visa restrictions in a bid to bring tourists flocking to the Silk Road cities that we’ve seen Joanna Lumley ooh and aah over. The Nukus Museum of Art might be as close to the middle of nowhere as I have ever been, but it’s still one of the country’s top draws thanks to its Savitsky Collection, which exists precisely because it’s so far from anywhere else.

Igor Savitsky, a former electrician born into a rich Russian family, came to this area on an archaeological dig around 1950 and started collecting local artefacts, textiles and jewellery. Because he was so far from Moscow (and the other centre of power, Tashkent) he was able to amass a huge collection of dissident avant garde art. Eventually he established a museum in 1966. The remoteness of the region allowed him to show and buy paintings that had been banned – the authorities simply had no idea what he was up to. But while the collection may be impressive – Volkov, Kurzin and Lysenko all feature – it’s hard to imagine this place being able to compete with the world’s big collections. As you step over puddles along mud tracks towards a bleak square where the museum stands, everything feels deserted and half dead.

Inside, I approach an elaborate staircase and am welcomed by a charming guide. The art is everywhere – stacked up in some places against the wall as rain comes in through a leaking roof. Then you start to understand what you are seeing, and it’s mind-blowing.

Savitsky risked everything for this collection. Some of these painters were tortured or murdered or spent long years in the gulags. The work collected is of both Russian and Uzbek artists who painted after the 30s, when all work that wasn’t socialist realism was banned by Stalin. Any other styles of the time – the emerging cubism, futurism, even impressionism – were deemed criminal. Formalism, as it was called, was punishable. And the punishments were severe. Savitsky realised he could rescue these works. He would take a train to Moscow which took three days and charm the families of the painters; they would bring down works stuffed in attics. He was known as “the widow’s friend”. Part chancer, part hoarder, he brought together this collection of which only a small percentage is on show.

It’s peculiar to walk into a treasure trove worth millions to international art dealers, yet see the place in such a dire state. There is nothing to do in this town apart from the museum: no restaurants, just a couple of grotty hotels. The infrastructure surrounding most successful art galleries is totally lacking. Is this me applying my western eye to what a museum should be? Possibly, but the art itself speaks to Savitsky’s colonial gaze on this culture. There are beautiful, Gauguin-like paintings by Nikolaev of the local boys with flowers, who dance for the men. This painter was arrested because of his sexuality and then converted to Islam. The tension between socialist realism and orientalism is played out on the walls here.

Some of this “degenerate” art is both overtly political and stylistically breathtaking. There are paintings openly critical of Stalin with Lenin as a shadow lurking in the corner. Volkov and Karahan endeavour to represent the new. Kandinsky had already escaped. Stalin’s 1932 decree on the Reconstruction of the Literary and Artistic Organisations – which brought artists under Communist party control in an effort to unify political and aesthetic objectives – meant an artist like Mikhail Kurzin who depicted Soviet man as ugly was sentenced to five years in prison. His is a harsh, brilliant work. Otto Dix comes to mind.

There are many works by women and Jewish artists in this huge collection. It is only relatively recently that such work could even be spoken about. When the museum showed the drawings of Nadezhda Boravaya – scraps of paper showing emaciated prisoners, dead children and women with identity numbers – the catalogue told visitors that these were imaginary drawings of a German concentration camp. In 1982 it was still not acceptable to tell the truth, that these were smuggled out of Soviet gulags.

The famous Bull painted by Vladimir Lysenko, who was also imprisoned, had to be taken down the day the KGB arrived. Savitsky renamed it Fascism Advances and put it back up the next day. It was only during perestroika that any of this could be spoken about.

In truth, this vast emporium of dissidence and local culture needs so much more than a new director. It needs a restorer. On its wish list are basics such as moth strips and fax machines. The current director, Gulbahar Izentaeva, gave us tea and was bemused that her own job was being advertised. Relations between Tashkent and the museum, which is in the autonomous Republic of Karakalpakstan, seem strained to say the least.

A former director left having being accused of stealing but will be on the board of appointing the next director. Questions about how this will work were met with Soviet defensiveness. Making it work will be incredibly difficult.

I wondered about collaboration, and indeed some of the paintings have been shown at the Pushkin Moscow. “Move the museum to Tashkent, just move it!” someone said and I could see why.

Yet as we drove through the desert from Nukus to the jewel that is Khiva, with its walled city, stopping at pre-Islamic desert castles, one could see what had drawn Savitsky to this place. I became interested not just with the great painters but the textiles and ceramics of Uzbekistan. The women make tapestries called suzanis as part of their dowries and sew into them symbols of fertility: lush pomegranates, birds, horns, their secret desires woven into clothes. Savitsky collected those too.

While other places in Uzbekistan were as gushworthy as everyone said, Nukus stayed with me. And the museum, in its oddness, is far removed from the usual “exit through the gift shop” experience of most art galleries. This is art that artists died for, collected by someone whose passion was to save their work. He believed one day that these artists would be recognised and rehabilitated.

Can this unique museum survive, when places like Abu Dhabi or even Vegas bolt on art galleries to show their cultural capital by simply paying for it? This is the very opposite of that. And it will soon be someone’s job to get people to go there.",The lost Louvre of Uzbekistan: the museum that hid art banned by Stalin,"arts, culture, entertainment and media",culture,1290
572188,tass,"RUSADA Deputy Director General Margarita Pakhnotskaya said speaking at ‘Russia - Country of Sports’ international sports forum in Nizhny Novgorod that she had been subjected to stern criticism after the ban on the consumption of alcoholic and low-alcoholic beverages during doping tests was enforced.

NIZHNY NOVGOROD, October 11. /TASS/. The Russia Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) received an aggressive response after the agency prohibited athletes from consuming alcoholic beverages during doping test procedures, a senior executive with RUSADA said on Friday.

""There were in fact three reasons to introduce this ban,"" Pakhnotskaya said. ""Firstly, it is detrimental to the health of an athlete and it is proved by findings of numerous expert commissions.""

""Secondly, the consumption of alcohol leads to acts of an indecent behavior at doping control centers and it was not only about indecent behavior, but also about voiced threats in regard to doping control officers,"" she continued.

""Thirdly, alcohol obstructs the process of detecting a possible consumption of a banned performance enhancing drug,"" Pakhnotskaya added.

Pakhnotskaya stated in early March that RUSADA had prohibited national athletes from drinking beer and other soft-alcoholic beverages to speed up the process of urination during doping test procedures.

Athletes’ bodies are usually dehydrated after crossing the finish line and some of them use beer or other soft-alcoholic drinks as a diuretic agent to accelerate the process of collecting urine doping samples.

Many areas are expected to wake up to widespread frosts, while bitter winds are also forecast as the country remains gripped by chilly conditions.

Met Office forecaster Grahame Madge said: “There will be frost overnight in some places and that will be a consequence of the colder air that will be over the UK.”

The mercury is set to plummet as low as 0C overnight in London and the South East while in the Scottish Highlands it could be as cold as -3C.

The cooler air is thought coming over from Scandinavia and central Europe, Mr Madge said, although he added it is not unusual for spring to see temperatures such as these or for a brief cold burst to hit.

Conditions across the country are set to warm up again by midweek, he said.

​This is the second position the Saudi energy minister loses in less than a week. On Friday, the industry and mining function was separated from the Energy Ministry in a government reshuffle, creating the independent Ministry of Industry and Mineral Resources in a move to diversify the state's economy.

Earlier in the day, Saudi Aramco officially announced that the Saudi government replaced Falih from his position as Chairman of Saudi Aramco, appointing Governor of the Public Investment Fund (PIF) Yasir Al-Rumayyan to the role.

The move is aimed at separating the Saudi Energy Ministry from Saudi Aramco before the IPO to avoid conflict of interests. However, it was not clear if the minister would retain his place on the board of directors.

In order for Saudi Arabia to balance its budget, oil needs to trade at around $80 per barrel, according to various estimates. Falih has been working with OPEC+ partners, including Russia, to balance the oil market and raise the price since 2016, but have faced various challenges, including an increasing shale output in the United States, a US-China trade war, crises in Libya, Venezuela, and sanctions against Iran.

The plans for Saudi Aramco's IPO as part of the kingdom's Vision 2030 economic overhaul plan have been delayed a number of times.

Alameda County Superior Court Judge James Cramer said Tuesday that John Lee Cowell will face trial starting in January for the unprovoked stabbing death of 18-year-old Nia Wilson in July 2018, KPIX-TV reported.

Cowell has been charged with murder and attempted murder for the attack on Wilson and her sister, Letifah, 26, who was wounded in the attack.

The trial had been in legal limbo as authorities sought to determine Cowell's mental competence. At a hearing Monday, Cramer said that Cowell was not cooperating with doctors appointed last month to evaluate him, for the latest in a series of evaluations. The judge said he understood Cowell has a history of mental illness but that doctors who had previously examined him felt he was “malingering”to avoid standing trial. The judge recessed the hearing, saying he needed 24 hours to reach his decision and announced his ruling Tuesday.

Wilson's death was one of several violent or fatal attacks on Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) lines that connect San Francisco to the cities of Berkeley, Oakland and others.

BART has announced new safety measures and installed thousands of security cameras as part of an effort to increase safety.

Pictures from the park, Disney's busiest, showed attractions empty as worried tourists opted to stay at home rather than brave the bad weather.

Disney World was forced to close yesterday afternoon anticipation of strong winds, but re-opened this morning.

The park said it expects to see a spike in visitors over the weekend as guests who have postponed their trips return.

Dorian has now been downgraded to a category two storm, but wind speeds remain as high as 110mph.

The cyclone is now heading north, and will pass the states of Georgia and South Carolina over the next 24 hours.

It is expected to reach North Carolina on Friday morning before passing back out into the Atlantic Ocean.

The US National Hurricane Center said that life-threatening storm floods and dangerous winds are expected along the states' coasts.

""The flash flood threat will increase overnight along the Florida east coast, then spread up the southeast and mid Atlantic coast beginning Wednesday,"" the Center said.



Dorian has already left acres of debris and some 13,000 homes destroyed across the Bahamas after moving over the islands earlier this week.

Seven people have been confirmed killed, with the death toll expected to grow.

The long-term impact on the tourism-dependent islands is also expected to be significant.

All tropical storm warnings for the islands have now been discontinued.

1,21stcenturywire,"The  in Hollywood continues to eat itself, as the politically correct culture is now being used to protect the public images of despots and dictators – as long as the price is right.

One can only imagine what the threat, or promise of future cash was which prompted this latest censorship move by the vapid cultural gatekeepers at Netflix.

Netflix has removed an episode of comedy show Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj for viewers in Saudi Arabia after the country complained about the host’s criticism of its war in Yemen and the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.

According to the FT, the streaming site confirmed it had removed the episode, which is described on the website as: “Hasan exposes grim truths about Saudi Arabia and the charismatic crown prince known as ‘MBS [Mohammed bin Salman].'”

The decision followed a complaint made by Saudi Arabia’s Communications and Information Technology Commission on the grounds that the episode violated the anti-cyber crime law against “material impinging on public order, religious values, public morals, and privacy”.

Under Article 6 of Saudi Arabia’s anti-cyber crime law, “production, preparation, transmission, or storage” of such material “through the information network or computers” is punishable by a five-year prison sentence and a 3m Saudi riyal ($800,000) fine.

In the episode, the comedian takes aim at the kingdom in the aftermath of Khashoggi’s assassination inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October.

Both the Saudi-led war in Yemen, which he calls “the biggest tragedy of the MBS era”, and the crown prince himself come in for criticism. Minhaj calls for American ties to the oil-rich kingdom to be placed under the spotlight.

“Now would be a good time to reassess our relationship with Saudi Arabia. And I mean that as a Muslim, and as an American,” he says in the episode.

Netflix defended the decision in a statement, saying: “We strongly support artistic freedom worldwide and only removed this episode in Saudi Arabia after we had received a valid legal request – and to comply with local law.”

The report has provoked a response from many prominent figures on social media.

“Wow. When Netflix censors material on behalf of Mohammad bin Salman,” tweeted Iyad el-Baghdadi, a Norway-based human rights activist. “Many of us Arabs were very excited when Netflix launched its MENA division, because we thought this is a way in which we can bypass censorship. I guess there’s the end of that.”

“Money always comes ahead of principles. Corporatism is a pillar of the structure of power that keeps us pinned down,” he added.

Croatian midfielder Ivan Perisic could finally end his long-running transfer saga and sign for Manchester United.

The 29-year-old was a long-standing target of former boss Jose Mourinho. However Woodward believed the asking price was high for a player of his age.

But now Inter Milan seem keener to sell as they look to fund a bid for Real Madrid’s Luka Modric.

He only penned a new deal at the San Siro last summer, but according to Tuttosport via Calciomercato, the Nerazzurri may look to sell him as they bid for his compatriot.

Inter did want nearly £50m for the creative attacking midfielder.

However that may will drop to around £30m as they look to cash in.

James Tarkowski is reportedly wanted to solve the Reds' defensive issues.

But Burnley aren't playing ball - and want £50 million for the centre-back.

The Sun say Liverpool have made an ambitious loan bid for the player but will be put off by the Clarets' asking price.

Liverpool are ready to enter the race for Nicolo Barella.

But TransferMarketWeb claim Liverpool are one of a number of clubs who are keeping track of the situation.

AC Milan, Napoli, Roma and Inter Milan are all also watching.

The striker has only played a bit part at Anfield this season and has 18 months to run on his contract.

The Hammers are in the market for a striker and are said to be considering an offer.

Jurgen Klopp isn't keen to lose a striker - and won't bring one in this January.

Liverpool winger Bobby Adekanye had looked all set to leave Anfield.

The 19-year-old was negotiating a five-year deal with Serie A side Lazio after talking to the Rome club for the last month and was according to Corriere dello Sport .

It seemed that he was all set to leave in the summer for Simone Inzaghi’s side.

But Lazio have taken the extraordinary step of releasing a statement saying the Adekanye deal is not happening.

In fact they went to far as saying they’ve never entered into negotiations with the player.

They released a statement saying: “In reference to the news released by some press, according to which the SS Lazio would have found an agreement with the player Bobby Adekanye.

“The Company denies this circumstance and announces that it has not signed any contract, nor has it started negotiations for membership of the aforementioned player.”

Long-term Chelsea target Gonzalo Higuain has agreed to join the Stamford Bridge side, according to reports in Spain.

Marca say the deal will be completed in the next few hours, with the 31-year-old becoming the London club’s second signing of the transfer window after Christain Pulisic.

Higuain’s arrival will signal the departure of Alvaro Morata - with Seville keen on the Spaniard.

Higuain has been on loan at AC Milan from Juventus but has not hit form this season and Chelsea are prepared to pay his €40m transfer fee as well as his €8m a year wages.

Andreas Pereira could be on his way out of Manchester United as part of a deal to bring Fiorentina’s Nikola Milenkovic to the club.

Reports in Italy claim United will use Pereira as a makeweight in a deal to tempt Fiorentina to part with Milenkovic.

United are long-term admirers of the Serbian, and are prepared to let Pereira go in order to land their target.

Milenkovic , 21, has 10 caps for Serbia on top of his 79 senior appearances at club level for Partizan Belgrade and Fiorentina.

And La Nazione (via Calciomercato), say Pereira could be used to lure Milenkovic to Old Trafford as United continue their search for a centre-back.

Liverpool winger Rafael Camacho is heading back to Sporting Lisbon on loan – less than 24 hours after being given his debut by Jurgen Klopp, writes Simon Mullock.

Sources in Portugal, claim that Camacho has been allowed to move to Sporting on an 18-month loan deal after making his bow in the FA Cup defeat at Wolves last night.

The highly-rated teenager played impressed as a right-back at Molineux despite the 2-1 third-round loss.

But Klopp has decided that a move back to Sporting will help his development.

Camacho will be out of contract in the summer of 2020, when his spell in Portugal also comes to an end.

The Portuguese Under-18 international, began his career with the Lisbon club at the age of eight.

He moved to Manchester City’s academy when he was 13, before joining Liverpool two years ago.

712246,theguardianuk,"At least 25 people have died and 15 others are missing after one of the most powerful typhoons in decades struck wide areas of Japan’s main island on Saturday night.

Media reports said thousands of troops, firefighters and other emergency workers had been dispatched to rescue people trapped by floodwater in the worst-hit areas, as utilities raced to restore power to hundreds of thousands of homes.

Typhoon Hagibis, which has been described by meteorologists as the strongest storm to hit Japan for more than six decades, caused widespread damage across low-lying land in central and eastern parts of the country, with rivers bursting their banks after hours of torrential rain and howling winds.

Hagibis, which means “speed” in the Philippine language Tagalog, forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights and affected shinkansen bullet train services, the Japanese state broadcaster NHK said, reporting that more than 100 people had been injured.

Hagibis also caused disruption to major international sports events scheduled to take place over the three-day weekend, including the Rugby World Cup, forcing the cancellation of several pool matches.

Millions of residents of Tokyo awoke to sunshine and clear skies, and many train lines resumed services, but authorities warned that rivers in eastern Japan could still overflow and inflict more damage.

The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, held an emergency meeting and offered his support to all those affected by the disaster – the second destructive storm to hit Japan in the space of a month.

“I extend my condolences to all those who lost their lives and offer my sympathies to all those impacted,” Abe said. “With respect to blackouts, water outage and suspension of transportation services, we will do our utmost to bring about a swift recovery. We ask the public to stay vigilant in case of landslides and other hazards.”

The government said 27,000 members of the self-defence forces and other emergency workers had been sent to Nagano prefecture – one of the most badly affected regions – and other affected areas to help with the rescue effort.

TV footage showed military helicopters airlifting stranded people from homes that had been flooded by river water. Some families, including those with small children, had been forced to seek safety on their roofs.

One clip showed a helicopter hovering over a flooded area in Nagano prefecture, where an embankment of the Chikuma River had broken and unleashed sheets of water across residential areas. The helicopter plucked those stranded on the second floor of a home submerged in muddy waters.

Aerial footage showed tractors at work trying to control the flooding. Meanwhile, rows of bullet trains were left sitting in a pool of water at a depot.

The operator of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, which was wrecked by a deadly tsunami in March 2011, reported irregular readings from sensors monitoring water at the facility.

Emi Iwasa, a spokeswoman for Tokyo Electric Power, said the storm had triggered 11 leak alerts at the plant, eight of which were confirmed as having been caused by rainwater. The utility has not confirmed if any radioactive water leaked into sea.

Away from the plant, a stretch of Fukushima was flooded, with only the rooftops of residential homes visible. Parts of nearby Miyagi prefecture were also under water. The Tama river system, which runs by Tokyo, overflowed its banks.

Authorities at one point issued evacuation advisories and orders for more than 6 million people as the storm unleashed heavy rain and winds.

“The major typhoon has caused immense damage far and wide in eastern Japan,” Yoshihide Suga, the government’s top spokesman, told reporters.

“The water came up higher than my head in the house,” said Hajime Tokuda, a resident of Kawasaki, near Tokyo.

In Higashimatsuyama city, north-west of Tokyo, rice and flower farmers were counting their losses,water submerging warehouses full of freshly harvested crops.

“We never had a flood like this before in this neighbourhood,” said one farmer, who declined to give his name. “We cannot even go into the flower warehouse due to the water. I don’t know where to start cleaning up this mess.”

Authorities warned of a continuing threat from mudslides. Among the reported deaths were those whose homes had been buried. Other fatalities included people who were swept away by raging rivers.

Suga said damage to housing was extensive, but promised help was on its way. By Sunday afternoon, more than 160,000 homes were without electricity, the public broadcaster NHK said, adding that about 1,000 people in Chiba, east of Tokyo, were experiencing water shortages.

The widespread loss of electricity has again raised questions about Japan’s power infrastructure, weeks after Typhoon Faxai destroyed or damaged 30,000 houses in Chiba and caused extensive power cuts.

The improvements in safety infrastructure that accompanied Japan’s postwar modernisation were apparent, however. The authorities had repeatedly warned that Hagibis’s strength was on a par with a typhoon that hit the Tokyo region 61 years ago, but that storm, Typhoon Ida, left more than 1,200 people dead and half a million houses flooded.

The Rugby World Cup match between Namibia and Canada, scheduled for Sunday in Kamaishi on the country’s north-east coast, was cancelled, but the decisive fixture between Japan and Scotland in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, will go ahead the same evening.

The news comes only months before Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces a tough race in India's general elections.

A political controversy over the survey erupted after the acting chairman and another member of the body that reviewed the jobs data resigned, saying there had been a delay in its scheduled December release and alleging interference by other state agencies.

The survey, conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) between July 2017 and June 2018, showed that the unemployment rate stood at 6.1 percent, higher than the previous high point reached in 1972-1973, local media reported.

That year, when India was just coming out of a war with Pakistan and hit by global oil shocks like other oil-importing countries, the unemployment rate was 5.18 percent.

The government has questioned the report, saying it was ""not verified"".

""The government has not released data on employment as it is still being processed. When the data is ready we will release it,"" Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, a government policy advisory body, said at a press conference in New Delhi.

Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the main opposition Congress party who the polls show is closing in on Modi's lead in the May election, said the job report showed ""a national disaster"".

Over the last couple of years, India's economy has been growing rapidly by about seven percent annually, but uneven growth has meant that there are not enough new jobs to keep pace.

Young people make up a significant share of the unemployed, with 18.7 percent of urban males aged between 15 and 29 without work, and a jobless rate of 27.2 percent for urban females in the same age group.

The numbers show that Modi's ambitious Make-in-India project, which aims to lift the share of domestic manufacturing from 17 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to about 25 percent and create jobs for an estimated 1.2 million youth entering the market, has failed to take off.

The labour force participation rate, the proportion of the population that is working or seeking jobs, declined to 36.9 percent in 2017-2018 from 39.5 percent in 2011-2012, according to the report.

The report also provides the first numbers since Modi's decision in November 2016 to withdraw most of the country's banknotes from circulation overnight.

The survey comes a month after the All India Manufacturers’ Organisation released a report that said 3.5 million jobs had been lost since 2016.

That report said the job losses were mainly due to demonetisation and rising working costs after the launch of a national sales tax in July 2017, which led to hundreds of thousands losing jobs in small businesses.",India unemployment rate highest in 45 years: Report,labour,employment,451

The model hosted the celebratory meal at Mayfair restaurant China Tang, part of The Dorchester hotel, which offers private dining rooms for a £2,000 minimum spend.

Her close friends Stella McCartney, Sadie Frost, Meg Mathews Liv Tyler and make-up artist Charlotte Tilbury were all in attendance, along with Vogue editor Edward Enninful.

Instagram snaps shared by interior designer Mathews on the night showed the lavish dining room decked out with gold balloons that spelled out ‘Happy Birthday.’

The highlight of the night was perhaps the Moss-themed cake, which featured a rainbow-coloured sponge base, a meringue top and miniature replicas of the model’s many Vogue covers, held in place with cocktail sticks.

The phrase ‘No fee no me’ was written in icing on the plate.

In a video clip shared by Mathews, the model looked overjoyed as the cake was wheeled into the room, complete with two huge sparklers.

Frost also gave Instagram followers a closer look at the birthday treat, writing: “Happy birthday Kate… what a lovely evening filled with so much love. It all just gets better.”

Fashion designer McCartney posted a special birthday tribute to the model on Instagram as they posed in front of the balloon display, wishing a “happy happy birthday” to “one of my oldest finest funniest friends.”

178008,eveningstandard,"The first Mother Oyster Sanctuary is set to be created in the Thames estuary in a bid to increase the oyster population which have been hit by pollution, disease and loss of natural habitat.

Working in the only Marine Conservation Zone in England for native oysters, the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) - chaired ENORI, which is a coalition of oystermen, local communities, NGOs, universities and UK Government, have begun creating the habitat required for the Mother Oyster Sanctuary, replenishing the Thames estuary’s lost oysters.

Over the last 200 years the oyster population has decreased by 95% due to historic overfishing and the oysters’ recovery has also been hindered by habitat loss, pollution and the introduction of diseases. Conservationists have concluded that microplastics do pose a risk to the health of shellfish and fish, though some species such as mussels are better at expelling microplastics and oysters are more sensitive to microplastics than mussels. The main risk pollutant on the Thames was previously TBT (Tributyltin), an anti-fouling paint used on boats which is now banned but as oysters are filter feeders, any chemical spill disrupts them.

As part of the project, ‘recycled’ shells from oysters bred in Mersea and sold in Borough Market and West Mersea as well as cockleshells from the Thames cockle fleet have been used to “lay the cultch” which means there is a hard surface for the oysters to grown on.

Once the “cultch laying” is completed, adult females or ‘mother oysters’ are laid, which when conditions are right, will spawn in the coming weeks; initiating the first stages of the native oyster’s life cycle.

Oyster farming has been recorded in Mersea since the Roman times, although populations of the European native, or Colchester oyster have suffered dramatic declines.

ZSL’s senior conservation programme manager for UK & Europe, Alison Debney, said: “It may not be glamorous work, but laying ‘mother oysters’ at the right time is vital to the success of the restoration programme, and therefore vital for the survival of this native British species.ENORI was founded in 2013 by the conservation coalition in an attempt to restore a nationally important breeding population that once supported hundreds of fishermen.

“The coalition has since moved more than 25,000 native oysters to Essex estuaries, as well as ensuring that fishing in the area is prohibited until the oyster stocks have sufficiently recovered and are able to withstand sustainable harvesting.”

Oysters are known as ‘ecosystem engineers’ and one adult oyster, for example, can filter more than 140 litres of water in a single day.

Dr Rebecca Korda, senior marine advisor at Natural England, said: “We are thrilled to be part of this collaboration which sees an array of stakeholders coming together and showing incredible innovation and drive to work to restore the native oyster and the native oyster beds back to the Essex waters. This is a hugely exciting and important step in taking this work forward and we are delighted to continue to support and contribute to the project.""

Rachel Langley, living seas co-ordinator at Essex Wildlife Trust, said: “We are delighted that this exciting project is evolving into its next phase and we have no doubt that the outcome of ENORI’s pioneering restoration work will be extremely positive for the Native oyster population and subsequently the marine ecosystem in Essex.”

ENORI is a joint venture between ZSL, Essex Wildlife Trust, Blackwater Oysterman’s Association, Blue Marine Foundation, The University of Essex, The Nature Conservancy, River Roach Oyster Company, Colchester Oyster Fishery, CEFAS, Natural England, the Environment Agency, and the Kent and Essex Inshore Fisheries Authority (KEIFCA).

Farmworkers, construction workers and others in the service industry stayed away from evacuation centers for fear that immigration authorities would use the crisis as an opportunity to detain and deport people.

As another massive fire burns the same area this week, it's been a very different story, according to immigrants and community groups that work closely with them.

Translators and aid workers have been at evacuation centers, interviewing families and scouting out items they need, such as baby formula, diapers or medication. Groups are raising funds and distributing cash for those out of work.

Local governments and California fire officials have increased bilingual outreach, posting social media updates in both languages. They also have told people that Immigration and Customs Enforcement won't have access to any shelters, trying to allay fears of an immigration raid.

""It was great because all these people were comfortable coming to these evacuation centers and it was something good to see,"" said Cal Fire spokesman Edwin Zuniga, who is bilingual and has been leading Spanish-language press conferences. ""It made me feel good that these people felt safe and it made me feel good that I was able to give them this information in Spanish and reach out to them.""

The fire burning in Sonoma County has forced over 180,000 to evacuate, has burned 167 homes and has grown to 121 square miles (313 square kilometers). Most of those evacuated have been allowed to return home, but they face power outages after California's biggest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, has again imposed blackouts.

Roughly 38,000 immigrants without legal status and 6,000 temporary farmworkers live in the county, advocacy groups say, and they've been able to help some 5,500 families, totaling about 20,000 people.

Diana Solis, of Windsor, was grateful for access to information. Solis, who doesn't have legal status, was picking grapes for a winery on Saturday when her boss told her to evacuate. Her car broke down on her way to pick up her 2-year-old son, and it would be hours before they landed at a shelter in Marin County. There, firefighters came by twice a day to provide the latest updates in Spanish, Solis said.

Labor and immigrant advocates say the way the government has handled communication with the Spanish-speaking communities has vastly improved since the 2017 wildfire, which claimed 22 lives and destroyed over 5,600 structures.

The slower speed of the fire has helped this time around.

In 2017, the fire struck in the middle of the night and moved quickly, so there was little time to prep. This year's so-called Kincade Fire spread less quickly, giving authorities more time to organize evacuations, communicate options and assuage fears.

Zuniga said his agency had learned from the 2017 fire, when it didn't do initial outreach in Spanish and many expressed fear of going to shelters over their immigration status. Zuniga said that this time around, Spanish-language messaging was delivered from the very beginning, and he's seen a difference in how the immigrant community has responded.

On Tuesday, a family with a 4-week-old baby was at a shelter struggling to find diapers and formula, said Mara Ventura, executive director of North Bay Jobs with Justice.

Ventura said the mother told her there was no privacy to nurse and the family hadn't been able to get to a store because of the blackout. The evacuation order was lifted in the family's neighborhood, but nobody had told them. Ventura gave the family some money and helped them home.

Gabriela Orantes, with the North Bay Organizing Project, said some immigrants may still fear encountering authorities at shelters, one reason her organization and others have tried to offer support.

Orantes said outreach in schools and government efforts to be more inclusive of Spanish speakers have worked well, but that migrants still lack access to resources. She said the news conference that was held in Spanish was a summary of the English-language one and didn't include all the specific details of the original.

""In that respect there's still a second-class citizen response that I feel is still happening,"" Orantes said.

Lupe Arias, a Mexican immigrant who lives in Healdsburg and works in packaging for a local winery, said she's been keeping up with the latest through Cal Fire's Facebook page, where the agency is posting Spanish-language video updates daily, and through text alerts. Arias, who lacks legal status, and her husband and three kids stayed with relatives in San Francisco until the evacuation order was lifted.

They've so far gone a week without pay— about $1,400 in wages from the three jobs they hold between two of them— and will likely have to borrow from friends to pay for food and rent.

""This impacts me because as you know we live off what we earn every day,"" Arias said.

The harvest season is winding down but not over, and many temporary farmworkers won't able to finish their jobs, so cash is tight and some will have to live in California or return to Mexico without the savings they expected.

Solis, a single mother, was worried about how she'd pay rent on Friday, having missed several days of work. She said she'd likely ask friends to loan her money until she's back on her feet.

""I still don't know what to do. It's stressful,"" Solis said through tears.","In California blaze, Spanish-speaking immigrants find help",society,immigration,898

technology, a university should be a balanced reflection of society. As a top
engineering university we believe that diversity and inclusiveness is crucial
for the quality of our teaching and research. More than that, we believe we
can turn a fully representative academic workforce into a unique strength.
This is why, from 1 July, all our job vacancies will be exclusively open to
female candidates for the first six months after they are advertised.

This is certainly a radical step, as the international [headlines about our
move](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jun/18/top-engineering-
university-to-open-jobs-exclusively-to-women) attest. But we felt it was a
necessary step as the more subtle measures we tried over the past 10 years
were to no avail. The targets we set for female recruitment and the missionary
work of our chief diversity officers were certainly useful in making our staff
and community aware of
[inequalities](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/13/workplace-gender-
discrimination-remains-rife-survey-finds) and their own biases. As a result,
at least two women are now on every selection panel. And yet, the gender
imbalance persists with only 16% of our full professors being female – one of
the lowest percentages in the Netherlands, and indeed in Europe.

What has become clear is that during the recruitment and selection processes,
all of us – males and females alike – have an [unconscious
bias](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/02/unconscious-bias-what-
is-it-and-can-it-be-eliminated) that means we gravitate towards male
candidates. This makes it harder for women to start and develop their academic
careers. To address this unfair situation, we had to take affirmative action,
even at the risk of upsetting some male candidates for jobs. The aim currently
is to raise female representation to at least 20% by 2020 and eventually to
over 30% in the next decade.

As a university devoted to engineering and technology we thrive on innovation
to create the unimaginable, such as [3D-printed
housing](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/06/netherlands-to-
build-worlds-first-habitable-3d-printed-houses) and living heart valves, and
this means it is essential to embrace diverse teams. There is overwhelming
evidence that they are more creative and productive. Including different
perspectives leads to better solutions. We simply need to tap the intellectual
power of all genders.

A university that is fully representative of society calls for an inclusive
academic community. But the change we are embarking on will also have a
favourable impact on the quality of our teaching and the varied perspectives
that our students encounter. In recent years we have successfully attracted
more female students, but now we need a culture change to enhance this
further. More female staff will attract even more female students. More female
professors will serve as role models and epitomise the values of the
university.

Again, this is not only a matter of fairness. In the Netherlands, as in many
other European countries, there is a shortage of
[engineers](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-
news/-/EDN-20190211-1). We simply can’t afford to exclude half the
intellectual potential of our populations. Besides, engineering is a
discipline that is all about brainpower, regardless of gender.

The laws of the European Union allow us to favour women, given suitable
competences, if they are seriously underrepresented. Smaller initiatives at
universities in Delft and Groningen, which have been challenged in court, have
shown that this is possible.

Diversity, of course, goes beyond gender. As a leading university we seek to
recruit academic staff worldwide and have been more successful in doing so
than in overcoming the gender gap. Some 40% of our young academic staff come
from overseas. Having tried many different ways of attracting female staff and
failing, it is time for tough measures. May many other universities follow our
lead.

35702,bbcuk,"The number of people in work in the UK has reached a record high of 32.54 million, latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show.

Unemployment was flat, with a small increase of 8,000 between September and November for a total of 1.37 million.

Average earnings excluding bonuses increased by 3.3% in the year to November, as wage rises continued to outpace inflation.

The number of job vacancies rose by 10,000 to a record high of 853,000.

ONS head of labour market David Freeman said: ""The number of people working grew again, with the share of the population in work now the highest on record.

""Meanwhile, the share of the workforce looking for work and unable to find it remains at its lowest for over 40 years, helped by a record number of job vacancies.

""Wage growth continues to outpace inflation, which fell back slightly in the latest month.""

The unemployment total is 68,000 lower than a year ago, with the jobless rate 0.2% down on this time in 2018. The number of job vacancies rose by 10,000 to a record high of 853,000.

The increase in both unemployment and employment is explained by the UK's rising population and fewer people being classed as economically inactive, which includes those on long-term sick leave, students, and people who have given up looking for a job.

The number of economically inactive people fell by 100,000 to 8.6 million, a rate of 21%, which is the lowest on record.

Employment Minister Alok Sharma said: ""Our pro-business policies have helped boost private sector employment by 3.8 million since 2010, and as the Resolution Foundation's latest report shows, the 'jobs-boom has helped some of the most disadvantaged groups find employment', providing opportunities across society.""

Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the figures were ""reassuring, showing no sign of any hit to firms' hiring ambitions due to Brexit"".

However, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, warned that the pace of wage increases may begin to ease.

""We doubt that wage growth will be sustained over the next six months at November's strong rate,"" he said, ""Pay settlements likely will weaken this year, as the previous year's inflation rate usually is the starting point for negotiations.

""Nonetheless, the labour market now looks tight enough to ensure that wage growth does not slip below the 3% mark.""

At first blush the most surprising thing about the jobs market as portrayed by the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics is how robust it is.

All this talk of Brexit uncertainty and yet employers continued to take people on. The number in work and the proportion in work continued to hit a new record - as it has done now, more or less continuously, for years. And the bulk of the new jobs were full-time; there are now a record 24 million full-time jobs in the UK.

Is the jobs market simply ignoring all the Brexit-induced political chaos?

Does this confirm suspicions that warnings of slower growth owing to the prospect of a no-deal Brexit was merely Project Fear?

The answer to the latter question is ""no"", and to the former ""we don't know yet"".

The key is that jobs figures trail the rest of the economy.

Firms that took people on in the September to November period will have decided to do so in the summer, when confidence was higher and the politics less fraught.

So we will still have to wait a few months to know if Brexit uncertainty has hit the jobs market or not.

Tej Parikh, senior economist at the Institute of Directors, said the employment figures may not be a marker for any possible interest rate rises.

""The Bank of England will be little moved by today's data. While the momentum behind wage growth may build support for interest rate hikes, Brexit remains the spanner in the works for the monetary policy committee,"" he said.

Separate figures from the ONS showed that government borrowing rose last month.

Public sector net borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, was £3bn in December, which was higher than expected and up £300m from the same month a year earlier.

Borrowing in the current financial year-to-date was has now reached £35.9bn, £13.1bn less than in the same period in 2017 and the lowest year-to-date figure for 16 years.

However, analysts said that on current trends, borrowing was set to exceed the £25.5bn forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility for the 2018-19 financial year as a whole.

My patient tennis coach — Milton, a former champion now in his 60s who has been coaching community tennis in south London since the Seventies — had his work cut out for him.

My motivation to pick up a racquet was not simply the influence of a romcom and a dilettante’s interest in the grand slam circuit. My Camberwell flat overlooks a jigsaw of pristine courts, radiant as a Slim Aarons photograph. On many evenings I have found myself standing at the window, mesmerised, as tennis players gambolled across them.

Moreover, after years of voguish gym classes in studios styled as nightclubs and presided over by tyrannical instructors who demanded that I “be the pain”, I was disillusioned with exercise. HIIT classes hone muscles but I wanted to be outside. I wanted to play.

Inevitably, I am late to this party: London’s courts are already prime real estate. According to the register Tennis for Free, the capital has more than 2,600 local tennis courts (not including those at clubs like Queen’s). In Burgess Park, where I now play once a week, courts are booked up a week in advance. In Stratford’s Olympic Park the courts are reportedly heaving on weekday evenings and weekends. Milton tells me he coaches in Camberwell morning until evening, seven days a week.

Obviously, it’s brilliant exercise. Tennis whittles the trunk, creating an ironclad core, steely obliques and toned upper arms. Getting low on the court targets the glutes and an hour of tennis is phenomenally efficient cardio.

But it’s also a game, and there’s the thrill of strategy. After years of exercise for vanity’s sake there is something satisfying in finessing a skill.",Why tennis is this summer&apos;s smash hit workout,lifestyle and leisure,exercise and fitness,400
215045,france24,"With just seven weeks to go before EU Parliament elections a sweeping study shows that, despite a rise in anti-immigration rhetoric, many Eastern and southern Europeans say they are more worried about emigration.

Despite efforts by some to frame EU legislative elections set for May 23-26 as a referendum on immigration policies, European citizens are not preoccupied by the issue, according to a European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) study conducted by the YouGov polling firm and released Monday.

The survey of 45,000 people across 14 EU countries takes in 80 percent of European Parliament seats, providing an enlightening snapshot of EU public opinion. Only 23 percent of those polled cited immigration as one of the two most important issues facing their country at the moment – a figure comparable to the proportion citing unemployment (20 percent), the cost of living (18 percent), health (17 percent) and corruption (16 percent).

“Most European leaders blindly subscribed to the idea that immigration was European citizens’ one and only preoccupation, but that’s a myth,” ECFR political analyst Pawel Zerka told FRANCE 24 on Monday. Zerka says that most of those surveyed did not note any effect of migration on their own lives, their jobs, their national identity or their personal security. It was only their perception of migration's impact on crime and security at the country-wide level that a majority of citizens deemed its overall effects to be negative.

Only Hungarians ranked migration as the top threat to the EU, which is “little wonder given the endless stream of propaganda that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban puts out through his state-controlled media”, according to ECFR director Mark Leonard.

In contrast, when the spectre of emigration is raised – people leaving their countries to settle elsewhere – more Hungarians (39 percent) and Italians (32 percent) say they are worried, despite the fiery rhetoric from Orban and Italy’s vehemently anti-migrant Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini.

The same goes for Spain (34 percent), and Romania (55 percent) and Poland (30 percent) farther east.

“It is one of the main revelations of our study: Emigration is a concern that must be addressed,” says Zerka.

Among the countries that worry most about emigration, a majority of those surveyed said they would even support legislation to prevent citizens from leaving their countries for extended periods of time.

“In a Europe that prides itself on tearing down borders and promoting free travel, this move towards self-imprisonment is remarkable, but perhaps understandable,” Leonard writes. “In Romania, one in five citizens have left their country over the last decade."" He said those left behind feel so desperate that they seem ready to construct new barriers for themselves, just three decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

The issues surrounding immigration are nevertheless likely to resurface during the European legislative campaign period. Far-right parties will likely seek to exploit the sentiments of the 22 percent of those polled who see “Islamic radicalism” as the top threat hanging over Europe by attempting to fuse the issues of radicalisation and immigration.

811165,themoscowtimes,"Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine started a full prisoner swap on Sunday, driving all remaining detainees in the five-year conflict to a handover point and starting to unload them. The swap, at a checkpoint near the industrial town of Horlivka in the Donetsk region, was expected to see Ukraine hand over 87 separatists in exchange for 55 pro-government Ukrainians, with armed troops from both sides looking on. Ukrainian men and women dressed in civilian clothing got off a bus after being brought to the rendez-vous point by separatist forces and were then herded into a nearby tent. ""The first 25 freed Ukrainians soon will be home,"" Ukraine's presidential office said.

The exchange, scheduled to be completed later on Sunday, is likely to be hailed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as proof he is making good on a promise to bring captured Ukrainians home. But some in Ukraine are unhappy that riot police accused of opening fire on protesters against the country's Russia-friendly then-president Viktor Yanukovich in 2014 are among those expected to be handed over. And though the swap will help build confidence between the two sides who are wrangling over how to implement a 2014 peace deal, serious disagreements remain and full normalization is a long way off. ""Today’s prisoner exchange in Donbass will bring relief to the persons involved and their families, but it will not bring the (peace) settlement any closer,"" Dmitri Trenin, head of the Moscow Carnegie Center and a former colonel in the Russian army, wrote on social media. ""The... terms remain anathema in Kiev, and this won’t change. The conflict is much more likely to become frozen than resolved."" Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Zelenskiy prepared the ground for the exchange at a summit in Paris earlier this month. Kiev's forces have been battling separatists in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine since 2014 in a conflict that has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Sporadic fighting continues despite a ceasefire agreement. Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed following Moscow's annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014, and its subsequent support for separatists in eastern Ukraine.

There have been several prisoner exchanges between Kiev and the separatists. In the last swap, conducted in December 2017, Ukraine handed over about 300 captives in exchange for around 70 people. Zelenskiy won a landslide election victory in April promising to end the conflict. Widely criticized domestically for his plan to grant special status to Donbass to help end the five-year conflict, Zelenskiy's latest actions have given rise to cautious optimism in some quarters. In September, after a carefully negotiated rapprochement, Russia and Ukraine swapped dozens of prisoners in a move that brought Western praise. Relations between the two countries have shown signs of improving in other areas too, including in the gas sector where Kiev and Moscow are discussing a new transit contract. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of using gas supplies to put pressure on it, but last week the parties managed to agree on the main points of a new deal.",Pro-Russian Separatists and Ukraine Begin All-for-All Prisoner Swap,"conflict, war and peace",prisoners of war,507
658089,thedcclothesline,"(Natural News) As of November 15, 2019, the rule of law no longer exists in the United States of America.

This has become abundantly apparent with the rigged jury decision to incarcerate Roger Stone for the “process crime” of misstating memories during interrogations with federal agents. In an era where Hillary Clinton is openly allowed by the director of the FBI (treasonous criminal James Comey) to destroy evidence, obstruct justice and get away with high-level crimes because “she didn’t mean to” violate the law, Roger Stone is about to be sentenced to what will essentially be life in prison (he’s 67 years old).

In an era when former president Barack Obama illegally laundered billions of dollars through international banks in order to fly actual pallets of cash to Iran to fund their nuclear weapons program, Julian Assange rots in custody, denied his freedom, his health and his sanity for over a decade, all as punishment for daring to expose the dark secrets of the military industrial complex.

The jury against Roger Stone was rigged with over 90% of the people in the jury pool found to be supporters of Hillary Clinton. The malicious fake news media smeared Stone for years, installing intense hatred in the minds of the jurists and cementing the outcome of the “trial,” if it can even be called that.

take our poll - story continues below

Meanwhile, Adam Schiff (Loonbag-CA) holds secret trials with secret transcripts in secret dungeons, coaching witnesses to say what he wants them to say while editing secret transcripts to make those witnesses appear to say things they never said. The treasonous media runs with every lie Schiff hands them, having long abandoned any last shred of journalistic integrity or basic human decency.

The rule of law has collapsed in America, and no one is safe from the hate-filled left-wing mob that now openly seeks to criminalize all political opposition.

If you oppose the Democrat mob, you will be targeted and destroyed

If you oppose the Democrats, you will eventually be targeted by the IRS (Lois Lerner, anyone?), arrested by the Feds in a midnight raid that’s coordinated with CNN (a la Roger Stone), de-platformed from all the major tech platforms, smeared on Wikipedia with an onslaught of fabricated lies, demonized by the fake news media with coordinated hit pieces (as the NYT just did with John Solomon) and harassed in public by violent, drooling left-wing mobs that are triggered into rage by the very sight of the American flag or a MAGA hat.

The juries in left-wing cities will never find a violent Leftist guilty, nor a conservative patriot innocent. A jury in San Francisco, for example, set an illegal alien free after he shot and killed an American woman in an obvious case of manslaughter, if not homicide. But he was set free because San Francisco is a “sanctuary” city, which means the people who run that collapsing sh#thole of feces and filth have decided to ignore the laws they don’t like.

And this is how things are now progressing — if you can call it that — all across the country, where the rule of law is abandoned at will, replaced by a raging, anti-American, anti-Trump, anti-freedom tyranny of the left-wing majority mob.

The left-wing dedication to authoritarianism and tyranny is now so complete that all the tech giants recently conspired to memory hole the name of the deep state spy “whistleblower” Eric Ciaramella. Even uttering that name will get you banned on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Indeed, stating a name now gets you banned from the public square for the simple reason that the deep state has ordered the tech giants to eliminate that name from public discourse.

Similarly, the tech giants have now banned a Republican candidate for congress simply for being a Republican. Under the tyrannical thumb of Jack Dorsey, an un-indicted criminal guilty of treason against America for rigging elections, Twitter is now banning people for merely tweeting, “I hired Donald Trump to fire people like Yovanovitch,” referring to the lying former ambassador of Ukraine, who is whining about being fired after wasting taxpayer money by doing a lousy job as ambassador.

The effort to criminalize Trump’s foreign policy, you see, is really just a symptom of a much larger effort being pursued by the lawless, deranged, lunatic Left: The complete criminalization of “disobedience” to the left-wing agenda.

The real goal is the criminalization of conservatism

Try standing up at your local city council meeting and declaring, “There are only two genders,” and you’ll get a taste of the level of outright lunacy, violence and authoritarianism that has now infected the minds of the American people (including those who call themselves “conservatives” but have surrendered to the insanity of the Left in order to try to sue for peace).

The real goal of the authoritarian Left is to criminalize conservativism, Christianity and disobedience against every left-wing agenda, including their desire to pump your children full of chemical castration drugs in the name of “transgenderism” justice — just the latest mental illness to sweep through the ranks of deranged Leftists whose cognitive function now resembles that of zombies.

The attacks on Trump, Roger Stone, Alex Jones, John Solomon, Sean Hannity and other prominent independent analysts were never about the real rule of law… it has always been about criminalizing opposition and using the twisted “injustice” system to incarcerate anyone who stands in the way of the lawless left-wing mob and its criminal mafia mob bosses like Hillary Clinton.

Now, because of the collapse of the rule of law in America, here’s where we find ourselves:
• There is now no point in surrendering to any federal agent in any circumstance, since there is zero possibility of experiencing a fair trial. Everything will be rigged against you: The evidence, the judge, the witnesses, the jury and the media. You will be gagged, denied your right to defend yourself and denied the right to say “you didn’t mean to” like Hillary Clinton got away with.
• Federal law enforcement is hopelessly corrupt, with the FBI now running political smear operations and staging nearly all the domestic terrorism plots in America. The FBI, under people like Mueller and Comey, has not only been involved in covering up the truths about 9/11, Oklahoma City, the assassination of Dr. MLK, Jr., the Waco raids and the 1993 attempted bombing of the Twin Towers; it actually turns out the FBI ran those operations. (See FBIcorruption.news.)
• Federal judges have zero loyalty to the rule of law and absolute loyalty to the deep state. They have abandoned any last shred of even the pretense of following the Constitution and now exploit their positions of power to shore up the power of the deep state while destroying all those who threaten it.
• There is no expectation of safety for a law-abiding citizen, since any person can be targeted by the left-wing mob (a la Adam Schiff, the left-wing media, the tech giants, deep state agents, etc.) and then silenced, assassinated, indicted, audited or otherwise destroyed by any combination of establishment weapons against dissent.
• Elections are now hopelessly rigged, with Democrats controlling nearly every election outcome through a combination of illegals voting (14 states give driver’s licenses to illegal aliens now), ballot harvesting and vote stuffing by using cyber warfare techniques to make sure all the people who previously left a particular state magically vote for Democrats. This is how Kentucky’s recent election was rigged.
• Democrats are now openly calling for acts of violence and street warfare against not just conservative candidates but their financial supporters. Recently, a Democrat in Texas doxxed Trump donors, releasing their names and home addresses to the public in order to encourage left-wing Antifa brownshirts to harass and intimidate Trump donors.
• There is no free speech in America, as the tech giants have now brazenly conspired to silence all pro-Trump voices in their highly illegal conspiracy to rig all future elections. Yet somehow, they seem to face zero push back from regulators, the FTC, the DOJ or Republican lawmakers (with a few exceptions such as MO Sen. Hawley, who is leading the charge against Big Tech’s illegal censorship).
• Second Amendment rights are being rapidly dismantled by left-wing cities and states as they seek to completely disarm the citizenry so that no resistance can be mounted against the corruption, treason and tyranny of left-wing government run by extreme criminals known as “Democrats.”
• The “mainstream media” has now devolved into nothing but a coordinated smear engine to de-legitimize and de-humanize the political opponents of the radical Left. NBC News, in particular, is engaged in such malicious smears that one of their hate pieces targeting my own publishing company resulted in hundreds of deranged, violent left-wing lunatics calling and threatening the employee of a hosting company that hosts some of our websites. The child of one employee was even threatened in public school by other students who were children of radical left-wing Antifa parents. As All News Pipeline reports, “With the MSM also releasing ‘hit pieces‘ upon outlets such as The Federalist and the Western Journal, we keep coming back to just how deeply the CIA had infiltrated the mainstream media going all the way back to the early 1950’s and ‘Operation Mockingbird‘, the large-scale propaganda program designed to manipulate the news media and, in so doing, manipulate the minds of every man, woman and child across America.”
• Driven to psychological extremism by the hate-filled fake news media, Leftists are now openly celebrating the abandonment of due process and the politically targeted extermination of free speech, claiming that these basic civil rights of speech and law have no place in a “tolerant” society. Yes, that’s their actual argument. They claim free speech is “violence.”
• As a result, Twitter has now collapsed into a cesspool of radical left-wing extremism and “groupthink,” where all voices of opposition are silenced, effectively creating a feedback loop of left-wing insanity that now drives Democrat candidates to positions so extreme and insane that even Barack Obama now claims the Left has gone way too far. (When Obama tells you that you’ve gone too far to the Left, you’re beyond all hope…)
• Mass mental illness is now parading around as “progressivism,” even when the signs of mental illness are irrefutable, such as parents trying to physically chop off the reproductive organs of their baby boys in order to convert them into transgenders.

Under the tyrannical rule of lawless, mentally ill Democrats, the government is now run like an organized crime syndicate. John W. Whitehead of The Rutherford Institute sums it all up perfectly in a recent column:

All of us are in danger.

In an age of prosecutions for thought crimes, pre-crime deterrence programs, and government agencies that operate like organized crime syndicates, there is a new kind of tyranny being imposed on those who dare to expose the crimes of the Deep State, whose reach has gone global.

The Deep State has embarked on a ruthless, take-no-prisoners, all-out assault on truth-tellers.

Activists, journalists and whistleblowers alike are being terrorized, traumatized, tortured and subjected to the fear-inducing, mind-altering, soul-destroying, smash-your-face-in tactics employed by the superpowers-that-be.

Following the current downward trajectory, it won’t be long before anyone who believes in holding the government accountable is labeled an “extremist,” is relegated to an underclass that doesn’t fit in, must be watched all the time, and is rounded up when the government deems it necessary.

Eventually, we will all be potential suspects, terrorists and lawbreakers in the eyes of the government.

Now the collapse will accelerate, and America will become Venezuela

Now that the rule of law has collapsed in America, and the media has become a psychological terrorism hub run by the CIA, and the courts have abandoned all justice, and the elections are all rigged by treasonous Democrats, we are going to witness a rapid collapse into despotism, lawlessness and desperation.

The model for this collapse is already on display for the world to see: Venezuela.

A doctor who still survives the collapse of civil society in Venezuela, Maybell Nieves, has written about how this collapse accelerates year after year, stripping away every right and last shred of human decency from the citizens as the corrupt, treasonous government becomes powerful and treacherous to everyone:

That’s probably why those first few years didn’t really feel like something was taken away from us… Later came the control of the prices of basic products, which caused the disappearance of those items and initiated a black market that is also very much in force to this day.

The decay was soon seen in many aspects. There was no longer maintenance on public roads, and public services failed often until reaching the point of constant failures of electric service, even for days. The public health situation is also getting worse and worse. As a health professional, I have seen this deterioration for the last 10 years.

The state will rip you off, but it doesn’t happen all of a sudden. There are a lot of logistics; it takes a long time to develop the kind of policy that makes citizens totally dependent on the state.

You start by losing something unimportant, like some kind of monetary bonus now given to you as government-run grocery store credits, and you end up losing your freedom and all kinds of rights, including freedom of speech and protest, but these issues are so extensive that they require an article of their own to explain them properly.

The state has taken charge, with great success I must say, and you are now living in fear of the so-called public authorities, meaning police and military police, since they serve as pro-government forces of repression.

In any public protest, savage repression is a constant. That violence is what we Venezuelans have become used to.When there is no public or social security, when the devaluation of the currency is occurring on a daily basis, and when you don’t know if the bakery on the corner is going to be broken into tomorrow, at that moment, the debacle has already occurred.

So the mismanagement of incompetent and corrupt civil servants results in the deep separation of three social classes: extreme poverty, which represents more than 80% of the population and is totally dependent on the government; the working middle class, which manages to subsist through one or two basic incomes plus the economic help of family members abroad; and those who do business with the government and can live in a very comfortable, ideal world that has nothing to do with reality.

There comes a point at which the only thing in your mind is to know if you will return home alive. Everything else is secondary. At that point, the state has already massacred you internally. You can never be the same again. I’m sure I am not.

This is the future for America if We the People do not take this country back from the lawless, treasonous, eternally corrupt deep state puppetmasters

What you read above is what you will be living soon in America as the collapse continues:
• The streets of left-wing cities will be running with feces and filth. In many cities, they already are.
• The collapse of the rule of law will lead to exploding crime rates everywhere.
• Corporations like Google will decide all future elections, and if your speech does not agree with the ideas of unelected Google engineers, you will be silenced and demonized.
• The deep state will make sure that all voices of opposition to the corrupt establishment — including independent journalists — will be criminalized, arrested, indicted and likely “Jeffrey Epsteined.”
• As the rule of law collapses, business transactions will become increasingly difficult to complete. Eventually, food supplies will collapse and deliveries will cease, leading to mass food riots in the nation’s most populated cities.
• After Trump is removed from power by treasonous criminals in the deep state (Brennan, Comey, Mueller, McCabe, etc.), the federal government will declare war on the American people and go door to door, seizing guns, executing Christians, setting fire to the homes of conservatives, looting household valuables and kidnapping wives and daughters for human trafficking operations run in conjunction with UN troops which will also occupy U.S. soil.
• America will be turned into a war zone, with the government waging war against the Constitution, the People and human rights.
• The economic collapse will accelerate, leading to widespread impoverishment, starvation, desperation, crime and corruption.
• The violence of the lunatic Left will rapidly increase to the point where Leftists openly engage in executions, rapings, kidnappings, lootings and anything else they can get away with, always targeting conservatives and “white people,” thanks to the hatred pushed by the NYT, WashPost, CNN, MSNBC and late night comedy shows like Jimmy Kimmel.

The rule of LAW now collapses to the rule of FORCE

You can probably imagine what else will occur. Basically it’s the collapse of human society. During all this, of course, armed American patriots will be taking it to the criminal traitors in all sorts of various ways, all across America. It will probably be open season on corruption, everywhere across America. Sadly, with the rule of law now dead in America, any reasonable person must wonder incentive remains for anyone to abide by any law whatsoever?

The only thing that matters to the corrupt Democrats now is force. The radical Left will use force to destroy you if you don’t comply. They will have you arrested at gunpoint or attacked on the streets at the hands of violent Antifa mobs. They will even force you to vaccinate your children at gunpoint… or they will medically kidnap your children at gunpoint if you refuse to comply.

Force is now the only rule remaining in deep state-controlled America. Everything else has collapsed. There is no free speech, no fair trial, no system of justice, no reasonable expectation of human rights anywhere, no fair elections, no honest news, no honest Wall Street operations, no real public education, no clean food, no certainty of safety with products purchased on Amazon.com, no faith in the broken banking system, no faith that any elected official will keep any promises, no trust in the FBI or federal law enforcement and no reasonable expectation that anything will get better.

Just as I promised they would, the Democrats are destroying everything of value as they seek to demolish human decency, human rights and human society. This is their goal. Do not be deluded into thinking anything else.

It won’t be long before this website is blockaded by all internet tech companies, by the way. All voices of dissent will be erased and memory holed. You will soon be on your own.

Prepare to take steps to defend your survival, for that is what all this has come to. If you aren’t willing to defend your nation, your Constitution, your life and the rule of law, then the DEMONrats have already won and humanity will be extinguished in no time at all.

Barwin entered the league as a second-round pick by the Houston Texans in the 2009 NFL Draft. The Cincinnati product spent four seasons with the Texans before a four-year tenure with the Philadelphia Eagles. He spent the 2017 season with the Los Angeles Rams before signing with the Giants before the 2018 campaign. The Giants cut Barwin in February.

""[Tuesday] I turn 33 and after a decade of playing the greatest sport there is, I'm excited to say I'm moving on to the next chapter of my life,"" Barwin wrote on Instagram.

44764,bbcuk,"Labour is promising to open 1,000 new Sure Start children's centres in England.

Party leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would invest £1bn in the early years centres, as part of a package of childcare support.

The Lib Dems will promise subsidised childcare for working families from when children are nine months old.

The Conservatives say they are already ""investing record amounts in high-quality childcare"".

Childcare providers have expressed scepticism at the lack of funding details and warned of an ""electoral arms race"" on childcare promises.

On a visit to Leeds with shadow education secretary Angela Rayner, Mr Corbyn will promise to open a new generation of Sure Start centres, which provide health, welfare and education services for pre-school children.

According to a report from the Sutton Trust last year, up to 1,000 have closed in the past decade, with funding pressures being blamed.

Labour says it will ""reverse the cuts"" in the centres which were originally launched when Tony Blair was prime minister.
• Up to a thousand Sure Start centres have closed, says Sutton Trust
• Sure Start delivered big benefits but face closure, says IFS
• Who is eligible for the free 30 hours of childcare?

An analysis from the Institute of Fiscal Studies earlier this year said Sure Start had made a positive impact, with evidence that the health advice had ""significantly reduced"" the numbers of children being admitted to hospital.

But the financial think tank said it had been a story of a ""fast roll-out followed by deep spending cuts"", with spending peaking at £1.8bn in 2010 and then being cut to £600m by 2017-18.

The IFS puts the number of closures at about 500 sites - half the Sutton Trust estimate.

Labour has also restated its commitment to providing 30 hours-a-week of childcare for all two-to-four-year-olds, as part of its overall £4.5bn childcare package.

Ms Rayner said the extra support for early-years education could ""transform lives"".

Mr Corbyn said opening a Sure Start centre in ""every community"" would ""unlock the potential of every child"".

He said: ""Parents are struggling to afford the childcare support they need, while many children are going hungry and growing up homeless.""

The Liberal Democrats are unveiling their own childcare plans - offering 35 hours a week for all parents of two-to-four-year-olds.

This would be available for working parents from when their children are nine months old.

The Lib Dems say this will be funded by ""fair tax changes"", which they say means ""making sure that big businesses pay their share"".

Layla Moran, the Lib Dem education spokeswoman, said it would support families as they ""juggle the demands of modern life, working and parenting, by giving them more choice over how they organise their lives and improve social mobility with early-years education"".

More on the election
• What's the price tag on an election?

At present working parents of three- and four-year-olds in England are entitled to 30 hours' free childcare a week - and the Conservatives say they have increased the funding and quality of childcare provision while in government.

Early Years Minister Nick Gibb said: ""Labour's plans to abolish Ofsted would leave these centres without anyone properly checking your children are safe.""

Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, welcomed Labour's promise for new Sure Start centres.

But he raised concerns about funding the promises - and whether there would be adequate levels of payments for nurseries and childcare providers.

""This is a positive policy for the thousands of parents struggling to afford childcare - but the lack of detail on how it will be funded will strike fear into the hearts of many providers.

""We currently have a funding shortfall in the early years of two-thirds of a billion pounds. That shortfall, which has led to thousands of provider closures, is a direct result of an ongoing electoral arms race between political parties to entice parents with 'free childcare' without thinking through how it will be paid for.

During a House hearing Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez claimed that “Keystone XL, in particular, had one leak that leaked 210,000 gallons across South Dakota” while she questioned Wells Fargo president and CEO Timothy Sloan.

Ocasio-Cortez probably confused the Keystone XL pipeline with the Keystone pipeline, which has been operating since 2010. Keystone XL is still under construction, but would also bring oil sands from Canada to Nebraska where it would connect to existing pipeline.

Environmentalists spent years opposing the Keystone XL pipeline, filing court challenges and successfully lobbying former President Barack Obama to personally reject the project in late 2015. President Donald Trump reversed that decision in early 2017, but Keystone XL’s progress has since been delayed by activist lawsuits.

The existing Keystone pipeline, however, was responsible for leaking up to 9,700 barrels in South Dakota in 2017. The initial estimate for the spill was about 5,000 barrels, or 210,000 gallons of oil. Both Keystone and the planned XL line are operated by Canadian pipeline giant TransCanada.

TransCanada said it repaired the pipeline and cleaned-up the spill, Reuters reported in 2018, though the event has been used by environmental activists to gin up opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline.

Ocasio-Cortez, who recently introduced the Green New Deal resolution, also took aim at Wells Fargo’s financing of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which sparked violent protests along the project’s planned route throughout 2016.

Like Keystone XL, the Trump administration reversed the Obama administration’s blocking of the project. Dakota Access went into service in 2017. TransCanada had plans to begin building the Keystone XL pipeline later this year, but a February federal court ruling could delay construction until 2020.

Ocasio-Cortez also grilled Wells Fargo’s Sloan over their financing of the Dakota Access Pipeline, asking the bank CEO if his company should be responsible for cleaning up any oil spills. The freshman Democrat also claimed the Dakota Access pipeline has leaked five times since it began operating two years ago.

“So, hypothetically, if there was a leak from the Dakota Access Pipeline, why shouldn’t Wells Fargo pay for the cleanup of it, since it paid for the construction of the pipeline itself?” Ocasio-Cortez asked in Tuesday’s hearing.

“We don’t operate the pipeline, we provide financing to the company that’s operating the pipeline,” Sloan said, also noting Wells Fargo had an environmental oversight group.

112392,cnsnews,"(CNSNews.com) – Eighty percent of religious believers who are being persecuted around the world are Christians, and in some regions the scale and nature of the persecution approaches the international definition of genocide, according to a new report commissioned by Britain’s foreign office.

“The main impact of such genocidal acts against Christians is exodus,” says the report’s author, the Anglican Bishop of Truro in southwest England, Philip Mountstephen.

“Christianity now faces the possibility of being wiped out in parts of the Middle East where its roots go back furthest.”

The report released Thursday says the proportion of Christians in the Middle East and North Africa – a predominantly Muslim region – has dropped from around 20 percent of the total population a century ago to some four percent today. In Iraq, the number of Christians has plummeted from 1.5 million early this century to less than 120,000 today.

It examines the treatment of Christians across parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia, and turns a spotlight on many governments, among them Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, Iraq, Nigeria, and Algeria.

The report found that “high levels of persecution” were taking place in 50 countries, affecting some 245 million Christians. That’s more than ten percent of the world’s estimated 2.3 billion Christians.

Among the many problems identified:

State policies including clampdowns on public worship, a political climate in which extremism thrives, a trend towards religious conservatism in some Muslim-majority countries, the teaching of religious hatred in school textbooks, legal and social discrimination, hate speech targeting believers, arrests and intimidation, the destruction of churches and Christian symbols, and the abduction and killing of clergy.

“In some regions, the level and nature of persecution is arguably coming close to meeting the international definition of genocide, according to that adopted by the U.N.,” Mountstephen wrote.

British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who commissioned the independent study focused on Christian persecution early this year, told reporters in Ethiopia on Thursday, “I think we’ve all been asleep on the watch when it comes to the persecution of Christians.”

Hunt, a committed Christian, argued that some in the West have perhaps been held back from tackling the issue by “political correctness” and “an awkwardness” because of Europe’s colonial past.

“Personally, I think it is partly because of political correctness that we have avoided confronting this issue,” the Press Association quoted him as saying. “I think there is a misplaced worry that it is somehow colonialist to talk about a religion that was associated with colonial powers rather than the countries that we marched into to as colonizers.”

But, Hunt added, “what we have forgotten in that atmosphere of political correctness is actually the Christians that are being persecuted are some of the poorest people on the planet.”

Mountstephen made a similar point when the review was launched last January, saying that the Christian faith today is concentrated in poorer parts of the world, and is “not primarily an expression of white Western privilege.”

The report released Thursday is an interim one; the full report is due for publication over the summer, and is expected to include recommendations for government policies to respond to the situation.

Earlier this week in Washington, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, a statutory independent body, issued its annual report, which also found that the worst violators of religious freedom are located in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.

Unlike the British report, which focused solely on Christian persecution, the USCIRF examines and makes policy recommendations to the government on violations against adherents of all faiths.

The USCIRF report determined that 16 countries meet the statutory criteria for designation as “countries of particular concern” for especially egregious violations.

They are Burma, Central African Republic, China, Eritrea, Iran, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Vietnam.",New Study: 80 Percent of Persecuted Religious Believers Are Christians,religion and belief,religious text,621
8317,aljazeera,"Hundreds of Palestinian Muslims and Christians descended on the Haifa Museum of Art last Friday to protest the display of various artworks that use mass culture merchandise and corporate mascots to depict Christian icons. An online petition has also been launched to demand the removal of Finnish artist Jani Leinonen's artworks, which included a crucified Ronald McDonald and Mattel dolls - Ken and Barbie - representing Jesus Christ and Virgin Mary.

Although Leinonen made a name for himself as a subversive anti-capitalist protest artist, the artworks he chose to put on display in the Haifa Museum's ""Sacred Goods"" exhibition missed the mark.

In irreverent creations such as ""McJesus"", the artist offered little more than an uninspiring rehash of the centuries-old critique of the relationship between religion and capitalism. More importantly, he completely ignored the political context in which these artworks are displayed, allowing the Israeli establishment to use the local population's anger about the offensive exhibition to whitewash the oppression and threats the Palestinian Christians are currently facing.

Leinonen's McJesus, like other artwork in the exhibition, seeks to show how consumer products have become ""sacred goods,"" merchandise invested with the authority of religious power and symbolism.

However, there is nothing provocative or refreshing about this critique. The criticism of the sacralisation of capitalism and its obverse notion, the commercialisation of religion, has been ongoing for quite a few centuries now. Already in The Theory of the Moral Sentiments (1759), Adam Smith had used the ""invisible hand"" metaphor to draw this analogy between capitalism and religion. Ironically, the anachronistic nature of Leinonen's artwork was also highlighted in the curator's comment on the exhibition, where it was noted that ""Already in the late nineteenth century, writer Emile Zola crowned consumption as the new religion, in which religious rituals in a church have been replaced by purchasing ceremonies at a department store.""

Recycling the age-old critique of the complicity between religion and capitalism - as banal as it may be - could have still made an impact if Leinonen bothered to take into consideration the context in which these artworks are going to be displayed.

The local context was clearly on the artist's mind when he decided to transform a Ken doll into Jesus, as the box he packaged the doll in was emblazoned with the Hebrew word for Jesus (Yeshua). However, there was no commentary offered in any of his artworks about Israel's realities -  its occupation of Palestinian land and oppression of the Palestinian population.

In the hands of a different artist attuned to the brutal realities of the local context, the image of a crucified McDonalds' clown could have offered radical commentary on the Palestinian struggle for freedom. It could have easily highlighted the concerted efforts of both American religious institutions, especially evangelicals, and American corporate culture to provide material support and mythical narratives that legitimise the current policies of the authoritarian colonial-capitalist Israeli state.

Leinonen missed this opportunity. But even more importantly, his ""bad art"" allowed Israeli authorities to opportunistically exploit the indigenous population's protests about Leinonen's artworks and use the controversy to conceal the Israeli state's racist and discriminatory policies and mistreatment of Palestinian Christians.

Following protests by Palestinians, Israeli Culture Minister Miri Regev spared no time in condemning the art exhibition in the name of ""democratic values"" and"" tolerance for other cultural and religious traditions"".

In her letter to the museum director, Regev stated: ""The values that distinguish us as a Jewish and democratic state oblige us to respect the religious feelings of all citizens of the State of Israel - Muslims, Christians, Druze and others."" She insisted that disrespecting sacred symbols ""may affect the delicate fabric of our democratic society, which respects the religious feelings of others as one of its most enlightened foundations.""

This appeal for tolerance is belied not only by the racist, discriminatory and divisive policies of Israel but also by the past actions of Regev herself. In May 2012, for example, Regev received much unwanted public attention after she called Sudanese asylum seekers a ""cancer in the nation's body."" For the record, Regev later apologised to Israeli cancer patients for her offensive remarks about cancer, but never felt the need to apologise to the human beings that she likened to a deadly disease.

So what was behind the Culture Minister's uncharacteristic appeal for tolerance and newfound concern for the rights and sentiments of Israel's indigenous communities?

Regev's condemnation of the exhibition was an attempt to whitewash the ongoing Nakba and to present Israel as a state that respects the diverse religious identities of all its citizens and residents, including Christians.

This, of course, couldn't be further from the truth.

About a year ago, Theophilos III, the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, warned in an op-ed in the Guardian that Israeli policies are driving Palestinian Christians out of the Holy Land. He outlined the efforts of the Israeli Knesset to strip Palestinian Christians of their church lands and property rights through a ""church lands"" bill that would put an end to the church's sovereignty over its lands in the old city of Jerusalem.

Theophilos III also pointed out the activities of radical settler groups in and around Jerusalem that are destabilising the status quo regarding ""the protection and accessibility"" of the holy sites in the city. Many of these radical settlers have been suspected of carrying out ""price tag"" attacks on churches and other Christian properties, desecrating and vandalising churches, monasteries, and holy sites and spraying hate graffiti on them. In most of these cases, the Israeli authorities did not apprehend any suspects and dismissed the incidents on the grounds of unknown perpetrators.

These attacks on Christian churches and properties, which date back to the Nakba, also target Christians in the West Bank. Israeli forces, for example, have raided a well-known monastery in Bethlehem and attempted to confiscate its land to continue building its apartheid annexation and separation wall in the Cremisan Valley. It is important to note that Israeli military forces aid and abet the radical settlers in their desecration of Christian sites, offering them the protection they need as they raid these sites to perform religious rituals there.

The state's racist and discriminatory laws, closure policies and the apartheid annexation and separation wall restrict the access of Palestinian Christians to the holy sites in Jerusalem, effectively censuring their religious freedom and hindering them from practising their faith. These policies, as Theophilos III warns, threaten ""the very presence of Christians in the Holy Land"".

Disingenuous calls for tolerance and understanding by Israeli authority figures like Regev should not trick anyone into thinking that the capitalist settler-colony that is Israel cares about the religious sensitivities of Christians or Muslims living in Israel. Needless to say, as Regev was talking about the so-called ""democratic fabric"" of the Israeli society, Israeli state police was using stun grenades and tear gas to squash and disperse the crowds demonstrating near the museum.

Regev's letter also exposed a major shortcoming of the Israeli liberal left. Israeli leftists were outraged not only by Regev's failure to condemn ""the violence against the museum,"" but also by her threats to cut state funding for such offensive exhibitions. In their eyes, as always, violence was one-sided and perpetrated by the Arabs. They ignored the structural violence of the state in the name of the fight over culture and artistic freedom.

Leinonen's McJesus and other artwork in the ""Sacred Goods"" exhibition is uncharacteristic of his other subversive anti-capitalist protest art and the School of Disobedience he runs. In this exhibition, he misses an important opportunity to critique the more pernicious aspects of capitalist exploitation and fetishisation through a critical engagement with the structures of violence and social inequalities that constitute the authoritarian capitalist-colonial Israeli state. The only way out of the false universality of the corporate capitalist culture that the crucified clown represents and into the truly radical and egalitarian universality for which Jesus stands is the practice of decolonisation.

60556,birminghammail,"The most vulnerable children in Birmingham are more than three times as likely to skip school as their peers.

New figures from the Department for Education reveal that the city’s children in need missed 48,703 school sessions in 2017/18 without permission.

It means they were absent for 5.7 per cent of all sessions - or roughly one in 18 lessons.

Children who are not considered in need missed only 1.7 per cent of sessions over the same period.

The figures show 34.9 per cent of children in need were classed as persistent absentees - having missed at least 10 per cent of possible school sessions.

That compares with 13.0 per cent of children overall.

A child in need is someone who has been referred to social services but whose parents are still responsible for their care.

Experts said the most vulnerable children who are missing school are at a greater risk of being groomed for criminal and sexual exploitation.

Iryna Pona, policy manager at The Children’s Society, said: ““Participation in education may be difficult for these children and they might struggle to keep on top of their school work.

““In the short-term, if children are not in school they could face greater risks including grooming for criminal and sexual exploitation, especially if they are missing from home or care.

“Our research suggests that without adequate support, children’s happiness and well-being is likely to be damaged and they are less likely to do well at school and college as they approach adulthood, continue their education or find work or training opportunities.

“It’s vital that these children get extra support, both inside and outside school, which is focused upon improving their well-being and resolving issues in their lives.

“The government must also urgently address the £3bn funding shortfall facing children’s services departments by 2025, which is making it harder for councils to offer children and families early support before problems spiral out of control and have a real impact on their lives, including affecting school attendance.”

There is a difference between children in need and children in care.

Parents remain responsible for a child in need, while a child in care is looked after by their local authority - either in a care home or in foster care.

The figures show that children in need are more likely than children in care to miss school for no good reason.

Some 4.2 per cent of all possible school sessions were skipped by children in care.

The DfE data covers all primary, secondary and special-school pupils aged between five and 16.

Anne Longfield, the Children’s Commissioner for England, said: “The key to keeping vulnerable children in school is to offer early help to prevent problems developing when they start school, not waiting to intervene when they are already skipping school or at risk of exclusion.

“That means investing in early support for families who are struggling and need targeted help to tackle problems like domestic violence, mental health problems or substance abuse help, alongside more investment in speech and language therapy so children are not starting school unable to communicate properly and providing stability for children in care so that they’re not having to move around from one home to another and one school to another every few months.

“Talk to any child in prison, in trouble with the police or caught up in gangs and they will tell you that falling out of school was a trigger point.

“Gang members are 5.5 times more likely to have been excluded than the rest of the population. We need to do much more to keep children in school, where they have the structure, access to support and the opportunity to build relationships with trusted adults.

“I want to see a step change in the way we think about schools with a much greater focus on well-being, pastoral support and a drive to tackle off-rolling and exclusions.”

Damian Hinds, Education Secretary, said: “Education is the key to unlocking potential, and we cannot ignore the stark reality of the poorer outcomes for children who face chaotic lives or have experienced trauma or adversity.

“That is why we’ve provided practical advice to schools and social workers to adapt the way they support them, including having a consistent and trusted member of staff to talk to.

“We are also investing £84 million to support families and help provide stability at home.

“School leaders, social workers and other professionals have been responding to our Children in Need review to go further in improving outcomes and help us identify the support needed for those who need it most.”",The children most likely to skip school in Birmingham revealed,education,social learning,741

Italy’s Deputy Premier clearly wants to go all the way. After dispatching a team to fetch the extreme left-wing Italian terrorist Cesare Battisti in Brazil – with the help of the country’s president, Jair Bolsonaro – Salvini has now set his sights on leftist activists in France, according to French daily Le Figaro.

On Saturday, January 19, Salvini said he was ready to meet Emmanuel Macron, to negotiate their extradition. These terrorists include individuals from two decades ago who launched extremist attacks that caused a thousand deaths in Italy between 1970 and 1990.

“I’m ready to go to Paris to meet Macron, if it helps to bring those murderers back to Italy”, tweeted Salvini, as quoted by an article in Italian daily Il Giornale.

According to the Italian Ministry of the Interior, “thirty fugitive terrorists, 27 leftwing and three rightwing” have been in hiding abroad. Among them, 14 are refugees in France. The minister had already said on Sunday, January 13, that he was “ready for official steps to seek cooperation with countries hosting terrorists, starting with Paris”.

In the 1980s, then French President Francois Miterrand had promised that he would not extradite any extreme leftist activist who had renounced the armed struggle. A hundred Italian militants who had been involved in the horrors of the “years of lead” had then chosen France to start a new life.

Meanwhile, the Italian government’s bill on legitimate-self-defence will be approved by the end of February, Salvini said on Friday.

The bill would introduce rules similar to the US stand-your-ground laws where virtually all forms of self-defence on one’s property against intruders are deemed legitimate.

“Many people are asking me when parliament will approve the legitimate-defence law after years of chatter,” said League leader Salvini. “(The answer is) by the end of February. The aim is to (protect) the sacrosanct right to legitimate defence of good citizens, shopkeepers, entrepreneurs and farmers.

“This will be recognised by the Italian law by the end of February. “The job of being a robber will be a little more difficult and a little more risky”. Francesco Minisci, the president of the Italian magistrates union ANM, recently warned that the bill risked “legitimizing serious illegal conduct, including murder”.

He also said there was the danger that the bill could be “unconstitutional”.

Also on Friday, Salvini urged the father of one of the Rigopiano hotel avalanche victims not the pay a fine for crossing a police cordon to lay flowers at the site of his son’s death.

Alessio Feniello, father of Stefano, was fined 4 550 euros for breaching the judicial cordon marking the area where the collapsed hotel had stood.

“I told Feniello Sr not to pay a euro,” said Salvini. “That’s all we need, being fined for taking flowers to your son. If there’s a wrong law we’ll change the law”.

Both Deputy premiers – Luigi Di Maio together with Salvini – took part on in commemoration marking the second anniversary of the Rigopiano avalanche disaster in Abruzzo that claimed 29 lives. Di Maio and Salvini spoke to relatives at the victims at the ceremony, held at area of the disaster.

The avalanche hit the resort as 40 people, including guests and staff, were inside, as the hotel was engulfed by snow during extreme weather conditions at the time.

Some of the 29 victims were instantly crushed to death while others who remained trapped died of hypothermia and asphyxiation.

240625,hotair,"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio may be ringing up literally zero in any number of primary polls and he’s facing calls to be removed from his office back home, but you have to give the guy credit for staying in the box and swinging for the fences. He held several campaign events in Washington yesterday and during one appearance with labor union officials, he unveiled his latest policy proposal. It’s a “workers’ bill of rights” and you can tell precisely which members of the choir he’s singing to. It’s packed full of goodies that labor unions will love, plenty of free stuff for all his friends and unfunded debt as far as the eye can see. (Politico)

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled the first major policy proposal of his struggling presidential campaign Tuesday, heading to the nation’s capital to lay out a “workers’ bill of rights” at a union headquarters. The proposal, which he unveiled in a BuzzFeed op-ed earlier in the day, includes two weeks of paid time off for all workers, a national $15 minimum wage and stronger protections from terminations. “If you care about beating Donald Trump, working people are not going to come out and vote unless they believe it’ll actually change their lives,” de Blasio told a small crowd gathered for his event at the Communications Workers of America’s office in Washington, D.C.

This proposal is a transparent sop to the labor unions and it’s the same thing that nearly every Democrat in the race is doing. The unions largely fund their campaigns, so that makes sense, but Hizzoner is going way over the top in a (likely fruitless) attempt to win some union endorsements. But since some of his more viable opponents will probably adopt some of the same positions, it’s worth taking a look.

The fact that he wants a federal minimum wage of fifteen dollars per hour is the same as everyone else on the debate stage, so we can set that one aside. More interesting is the idea of scrapping “at will” employment and replacing it with “just cause.” That means that employers will have to be able to justify a decision to terminate employees in every instance. Having this sort of granular intrusion into employment decisions leads to two unavoidable results. Employers will be more cautious and slow in hiring because they’ll fear getting stuck with a dud of an employee. They will also be open to endless litigation whenever a disgruntled worker decides to go to court after losing their job. In the real world, hiring and termination decisions are hard enough without Big Brother holding a gun to your head.

He’s also calling for retirement benefits for all workers, including those in minimum wage jobs, freelancers and gig economy workers like Uber drivers. Can you imagine forcing McDonald’s franchises to set up pension funds for the kids operating the fry machine? A Big Mac would cost about twenty bucks. It would also exacerbate the unfunded pension crisis already plaguing many sectors around the nation.

There’s plenty more in there you can read for yourself, but it’s all basically one big gift wrapped up with a bow, being delivered in an effort to get some of the unions to endorse his candidacy. Unfortunately for the Mayor, the unions have two dozen other candidates to pick from, some with far better prospects of success, and they’re all willing to heap treasures upon them in exchange for their support.",De Blasio unveils workers’ bill of rights and it’s really… something,labour,employment legislation,578

David Vetter, pictured in September 1982 inside part of the bubble environment
that was his protective home until he died in 1984. Today most kids born with
severe combined immunodeficiency are successfully treated with bone marrow
transplants, but researchers think gene therapy is the future.

AP

Sometimes rare diseases can let scientists pioneer bold new ideas. That has
been the case with a condition that strikes fewer than 100 babies a year in
the United States. These infants are born without a functioning immune system.

The disease is called [severe combined
immunodeficiency](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/severe-
combined-immunodeficiency-scid), or SCID. ""It was made famous in the mid '70s
when the 'Bubble Boy' was described in a documentary, and I think it captured
the imagination of a lot of people,"" says [Matthew
Porteus](https://profiles.stanford.edu/matthew-porteus), a pediatrician at
Stanford University.

David Vetter was the boy who spent most of his short life [inside a plastic
bubble to protect him](https://primaryimmune.org/living-pi-explaining-pi-
others/story-david) from infection. He died at age 12 in 1984.

All babies born in the United States are now screened for this condition, and
the best treatment today — a bone marrow transplant — succeeds more than 90
percent of the time. The disease remains a source of great interest to
researchers.

""This is one of those diseases in which there's probably more doctors and
scientists studying the disease than patients who have the disease,"" Porteus
says.

In the 1990s, European scientists actually cured SCID in some patients, using
a technique called gene therapy. This process involves removing defective
blood cells from a patient, inserting a new gene with the help of a virus and
then putting the cells back into the body. Those cells then build up the
patient's immune system.

At first, this treatment in the 1990s and early 2000s looked really promising.

""Of the 20 patients, they all had immune recovery,"" says [Donald
Kohn](https://stemcell.ucla.edu/member/kohn), an immunologist at UCLA's Broad
Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research. ""But, over time, five
of them went on to develop a leukemia.""

He says 18 of those original patients are still alive today, but the leukemias
put an understandable pall on the whole field of gene therapy.

Scientists went to work to figure out how to inject new genes into cells
without triggering leukemia, a cancer of blood cells. And they think they've
succeeded.

Over time, there has been gradual improvement in gene therapy. The latest
advance, [reported in the __ New England Journal of
Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1815408) on Wednesday,
details a study of eight infants who have a type of SCID called SCID-X1.

The gene to correct the problem was inserted into a modified version of HIV,
the virus that causes AIDS. That engineered virus can't cause AIDS, and it has
been further tweaked to reduce the risk that it could trigger leukemia.

Gene therapy has been used successfully over the past decade. Scientists at
St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., modified the
procedure for SCID by giving the infants a short course of chemotherapy before
introducing the new gene. This helped the new cells take up permanent
residence. The babies developed apparently healthy immune systems, according
to the new study.

""I am thrilled to see these outstanding results,"" says Ewelina Mamcarz, a
transplant physician and first author on the new paper.

""To be able to see these babies in my clinic now as toddlers is very
rewarding,"" she says. ""They live normal lives. They aren't any different from
my daughters."" Two more infants have been treated since the paper was prepared
for publication, the team says.

Standard treatment for SCID is a bone marrow transplant. But that procedure
often restores only part of a child's immune system. As a result, patients
require monthly infusions of antibodies called immunoglobulins. [Jennifer
Puck](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/jennifer.puck), a pediatrician at UC San
Francisco and a collaborator in the latest study, says infants who got the
gene therapy don't need that medication.

These children are ""growing normally, they're getting colds like everyone else
and they're getting over infections — so I would say that is a cure,"" Puck
says.

Of course, she adds, they'll be watched carefully for signs of leukemia and to
see if the effect of the therapy is wearing off.

In her view, the key to treatment is finding these children early — through
newborn screening — before they start to get life-threatening infections.
Screening for SCID is now done throughout the U.S., though its introduction
was gradual and state by state.

Before screening was instituted, these children used to show up in the
hospital with life-threatening infections, ""and now we're seeing happy, bouncy
little newborns who just look perfectly normal and they're never sick,"" Puck
says. ""Sometimes their families don't understand just how profoundly affected
their immune system is.""

St. Jude hopes to commercialize its treatment. It has an exclusive licensing
agreement with Mustang Bio to develop a product. A similar treatment, called
[Strimvelis](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/strimvelis),
has already been approved by Europe's equivalent of the Food and Drug
Administration. It targets a different mutation that causes SCID, but the
technique is very much the same, including the brief dose of chemotherapy.

This latest advance is not only encouraging news for these rare patients. SCID
is a test case for all those scientists working to develop better gene therapy
techniques.

For example, instead of inserting a healthy gene into blood cells,
[Porteus](http://med.stanford.edu/porteuslab.html), the Stanford pediatrician,
has used a precision gene-editing technique called CRISPR [to correct the
genetic error](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09614-y) in blood
cells drawn from SCID patients. It works in the laboratory, ""and this really
sets the stage then for a clinical trial, hopefully in the next 12 to 18
months,"" he says.

All this makes the leukemia setback from the 1990s feel like a fading memory.
Kohn at UCLA says that for more than a decade, it seemed that the field of
gene therapy was a dead end.

Clearly it has made a comeback and has been used to treat other rare diseases,
including
[adrenoleukodystrophy](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1700554), a
neurological condition better known as Lorenzo's Oil disease, after a [1992
movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104756/) that highlighted a boy with the
condition and his parents' hunt for a cure.

Now, with continual advances in treating SCID, ""it's just nice to see another
success for gene therapy,"" Kohn says.

CAIR applauded Amazon’s decision to remove the products on January 4.

“We thank Amazon for its swift action on this issue and hope it sends a message to manufacturers of such inappropriate and offensive items that they will not profit from Islamophobia or any other form of bigotry,” Masih Fouladi, executive director of CAIR’s Washington state chapter, said in a statement.

CAIR representatives said that they have, however, received additional complaints that products deemed offensive to Islam remain on Amazon including toilet seat covers featuring Quranic verses.

“My gut feeling is that at least for the bath mats, shower curtains, and stuff like that, it’s these companies just slapping these designs on everything without even thinking about it,” said CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper. “But there are others crossing the line into intentional Islamophobia. Some of the companies have things like toilet seats. I mean come on, why else would you do that?”

Amazon’s response to CAIR’s complaint, however, raises the question of whether the company will remove any product considered offensive by any religion, like t-shirts depicting Jesus as gay or atheist texts that overtly denounce all religions as false and harmful.

10088,aljazeera,"A court in Japan has awarded nearly $4m in new damages to 152 residents forced to flee their houses after the Fukushima nuclear meltdown eight years ago, the world's most serious nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.

 

The Yokohama district court on Wednesday ordered the government and Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) to pay 419.6m yen ($3.8m) to the residents, a court spokeswoman told AFP news agency.

Triggered by a magnitude 9.1 earthquake, a tsunami crashed into the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in March 2011, overwhelming reactor cooling systems, causing multiple meltdowns and sending radiation over a large area that forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate.

Nearly 19,000 people were killed or went missing and 160,000 lost their homes and livelihoods in the massive earthquake and tsunami.

Presiding judge Ken Nakadaira said the government and TEPCO ""could have avoided the accident if they had taken measures"" against the tsunami, according to public broadcaster NHK.

The verdict was the fifth time the government has been ruled liable for the disaster in eastern Japan.

In March last year, a court in Kyoto, western Japan, ruled that both the government and TEPCO were responsible and ordered them to pay 110m yen ($992,300) to 110 residents.

However, in a separate case in September 2017 in Chiba near Tokyo, the court ruled that only the operator was liable.

Around 12,000 people who fled after the disaster due to radiation fears have filed various lawsuits against the government and TEPCO.

Cases have revolved around whether the government and TEPCO, both of whom are responsible for disaster prevention measures, could have foreseen the scale of the tsunami and subsequent meltdown.

The borough's ageing population means that there is growing demand for accommodation which meets the needs of the elderly.

But there are fears that the facilities favoured by some applicants are out of the price range of most local people and places will instead be filled largely by those moving in from other areas.

Cllr Ken Meeson, cabinet member for children, education and skills, said there were problems posed by schemes which did not meet local need.

""I have got one that's coming forward in my ward [Dorridge & Hockley Heath] which if you could afford it would be great,"" he said.

""They're talking about having a swimming pool on site, a cinema, a gym, but I doubt that it's going to be affordable for most of the people in Solihull, who want to downsize and want to go into that sort of accommodation.

""I don't know what the answer to that is and there's no easy answer.""

Last year, a separate retirement scheme, in Hampton Lane, Catherine de Barnes, was thrown out by councillors amid concerns that ""only a very few privileged people"" would be able to afford it.

The issue was raised as part of a wider discussion at this week's health and wellbeing board about Solihull's housing strategy and work being done to provide the homes that are so desperately needed.

Fiona Hughes, chief executive of Solihull Community Housing (SCH), said: ""There are, amongst the challenges, some real successes.

""We recently opened Saxon Court [in Chelmsley Wood] which is affordable social housing for our older residents and it's almost full already.""

Aside from this £7 million complex, which was officially opened just before Christmas, on the former home of Coleshill Heath School, an extra care facility is also being built on the old Powergen site, in Shirley - with 40 per cent affordable homes.

In response to officers' comments, Cllr Meeson said: ""You're doing very well, but it's how do we persuade the private sector to co-operate with our strategy?""

He had argued that the council had stressed the importance of more affordable properties, but that developers continued to put an emphasis on maximising profits - which often means the plans brought forward are at odds with local priorities.",Luxury retirement schemes too expensive for most Solihull residents,labour,retirement,382

The two year test, saw 2,000 randomly-selected citizens who did not have jobs given €560 – about £490 – a month for two years.

Although it was guaranteed to them whether they managed to find jobs or not, it did not appear to spur the recipients on to seek work more, researchers said.

“The impact on employment seems to have been minor on the grounds of the first trial year,” Finland’s minister of health and social affairs Pirkko Mattila said.

The experiment attracted global attention when it began, as it was the first time a European nation committed to paying its citizens a monthly tax-free wage with no strings attached.

But when compared to a control group who were not receiving the basic income, the test subjects given the money, were not significantly more likely to have got back into employment.

However, they did report being happier and healthier than the control group.

“The basic income recipients of the test group reported better wellbeing in every way in comparison with the comparison group,” the trial’s chief researcher Olli Kangas said.

The experiment formed one part of a range of welfare reforms launched by Finland’s centre-right government to try and bring down the country’s high unemployment rate.

Some 6.6 per cent of Finns were out of work in December; a 10-year low, but still almost two-thirds higher than the British rate of four per cent.

Finland has now embraced a different approach to the problem, imposing tougher new sanctions on unemployed people who choose not to accept jobs while receiving benefits.

Interest in basic income has soared in recent years.

A poll in August found 40 per cent of British people supported the concept and would welcome experiments of the radical policy in their local area.

John McDonnell, the Labour shadow chancellor, told The Independent last year his party would include plans for a pilot of universal basic income in its next election manifesto.",Universal basic income trial in Finland fails to help unemployed people back to work,labour,unemployment,319

Shots were fired near the Kennedy building on the UNCC campus on Tuesday afternoon around 4:40pm and the campus was temporarily locked down in response, with the school issuing an alert advising students to remain in a safe location. As police swept the remaining buildings on the campus, students were released to reunite with parents or family members at a designated location.

Two patients were dead on arrival and three more were in critical condition, according to police. Six victims in total were taken to to area hospitals.

Tuesday was the last day of classes and a concert was scheduled for the evening.

Videos retweeted by local media show students running and walking away from the building where the shooting occurred and police running toward the building, as well as a high concentration of emergency vehicles, including helicopters flying overhead.

A video posted by a student shows police leading an individual believed to be the shooter away.

Last year, a UNCC student was arrested and committed to a hospital after telling a doctor that he “could not wait to buy a gun and shoot the university up” and discussing an “explicit detailed plan…about killing and harming [UNCC] students and staff,” according to campus police. A search of his room turned up a copy of the school’s emergency response guide, with the section on dealing with active shooters attached to the wall – but no weapons. The student was banned from entering the campus.

290618,lifesitenews,"LIMA, Peru, December 10, 2019 (LifeSiteNews) — A human wall rose up to defend a Catholic church in Peru, offering only prayers and hymns to resist radical feminists who were protesting against violence against women and in favor of abortion.

On Saturday, which Catholics recognized as the eve of the feast of the Immaculate Conception, approximately 150 faithful prayed the rosary for several hours outside the Virgen Milagrosa parish church in the Miraflores suburb of the Peruvian capital. There they faced off some 300 radical feminists who assembled at Kennedy Park in front of the church, denouncing what the feminists call the “patriarchal violence to which we women and diverse people have been historically exposed.”

The feminists shouted their slogans and epithets from mid-afternoon until just after darkness fell. Circling the park and making several stops, the protesters headed toward the church in the company of police. In front of the church, the feminist protesters began chanting and dancing in unison. Some shouted, “I will abort my Lord!” Police stood in a line between the feminists and Catholics.

At the church, faithful Catholics waited for the demonstrators. Praying the rosary, the Catholics, men and women, sang hymns and also shouted, “I’m not a rapist,” “Long live men!,” and “Long live Christ the King!” The third was the rallying cry of Mexican Catholics of nearly one hundred years ago who fought against an anti-Catholic government, as well as Cubans of the 1960s who resisted the Marxist regime of Fidel Castro.

The hundreds of feminists, mostly young women, chanted in unison. “A rapist in your way,” is a chant and street performance that has become a worldwide leftist feminist hallmark, which includes the phrase, “You are the rapist” and repudiations of “patriarchy,” the state, and police. Some of the women at the front of the group were topless and wore masks, much like similar feminists in Russia, Europe, and North America.

Some wore green kerchiefs around their necks, the symbol used by abortion proponents throughout Latin America. The Peruvian feminists were protesting, ostensibly, against femicide — murder and violence committed by men against women — but also for abortion rights.

The feminists shouted at the Catholics defending the place of worship, “Christ doesn’t love you!” For their part, Catholics responded, “This is Peru, not Chile or Argentina!”

Protesters claim that police used pepper spray to disperse the crowd, and media outlet La República claims that police lobbed tear gas. The protesters eventually left the area without further incident.

The performance protest in Lima has echoed in cities in Latin America, the U.S., France, India, Spain, and Turkey. “A rapist in your way” has been translated into English, French, and Hindi and was originated by a group of young female radicals in Chile on the basis of the writings of feminist anthropologist Rita Segato, an Argentine who has made the study of violence against women her life’s work. The performance involves chanting, gesturing, and dancing in unison by the participants. It first appeared in Santiago, the capital of Chile, on November 25, the International Day of Elimination of Violence against Women. A similar protest was held in Miami on Sunday.

In nearby Chile, the Catholic Church has lost much of its prestige in the wake of resignations of bishops accused of countenancing child rapists. In recent weeks, anarchists and leftists have unleashed arson and vandalism against a church in Chile during anti-government protests. There, looters took pews, a crucifix, and statues of saints while setting fire to a historic church in Santiago, the capital.

In September, leftist pro-abortion protesters set fires in front of a cathedral in Mexico City, having also destroyed bus stops and sprayed graffitti on the building that houses Mexico’s Chamber of Commerce.",Catholics surround Peru church with prayer as feminist mob threatens desecration,religion and belief,religious facilities,613
42343,bbcuk,"Hundreds of people have been evacuated from the Derbyshire town of Whaley Bridge after part of a dam collapsed. So what has happened at Toddbrook Reservoir, and how safe are Britain's dams?

Toddbrook Reservoir has a type of dam known as an earth dam.

Richard Coackley, former president of the Institution of Civil Engineers, said the structures, also referred to as earthfill or embankment dams, feature:

Heavy rainfall caused water levels in the reservoir to rise and start flowing over the auxiliary - or emergency - spillway.

The structure failed and was partly eroded away by water flowing over it.

Alan Warren, chairman of the British Dam Society, said the cause was unclear.

""We don't know whether the concrete was inadequate or whether there was some problem underneath those concrete slabs which means the slabs fell into a void that had been forming underneath,"" he said.

""Maybe the joints in the slabs weren't properly sealed, and water was getting in through the joints.""

Mr Coackley said photos suggested that water had washed away soil beneath the slabs but the clay core was still intact.

""That's why the dam is still secure there at this stage,"" he said.

There are about 2,000 dams in England and Wales and about 800 in Scotland, according to Mr Coackley.

They have various owners and serve a range of purposes, he said.

""Water companies providing drinking water are major ones, then there are reservoirs providing water supplies to the original canal system.

""There are other dams just for fishing and there are other dams just for sailing and water sports. Other dams are to provide water for agriculture.""

Toddbrook's dam was built in the 1830s to create the reservoir, providing hydraulic power and water for the canal system.

It still provides that water and is owned by the Canal and River Trust.

Mr Coackley said Toddbrook helped to create wealth for Whaley Bridge before goods could be transported by road, and was still important for tourism and the local economy.

All UK reservoirs with a capacity above 25,000 cubic metres must comply with the Reservoirs Act.

Every dam must have a supervising civil engineer and an inspecting civil engineer to file annual safety reports to Defra, Mr Coackley said.

""That's part of an Act of Parliament that goes back 100 years.""

The Canal and River Trust said the annual inspection of Toddbrook Reservoir in November was ""absolutely fine"".

This coincided with an independent inspection taking place every 10 years, and this was fine, too.

""Our engineers also inspect the reservoir twice-weekly and this is how we picked up the problem,"" said a spokeswoman.

Not very often. Mr Coackley said failures were ""very unusual indeed"".

Prof Nigel Wright, a civil engineer and expert in flood risk management, said the last such evacuation in the UK was in 2007, when cracks appeared in the dam at Ulley Reservoir, near Rotherham, following heavy rain.

A new spillway was later built to replace the original which collapsed during the floods.

""Since that, the government has insisted that a lot of dams have been reanalysed to check what the danger is and come up with plans for evacuation if necessary,"" said Prof Wright, of Nottingham Trent University.

The last time anyone died due to a dam disaster in the UK was in 1925, when two dams burst, killing 16 people in the north Wales village of Dolgarrog.

That led to improved construction requirements under the Reservoirs Act, introduced in 1930 and updated in 1975.

The UK's worst-ever dam disaster was the Great Sheffield Flood of 1864, which claimed at least 240 lives.

Elsewhere in the world, dam disasters still lead to major loss of life. In January, 300 people died in a mudslide after a dam collapsed near Brumadinho in Brazil.

Mr Warren, of the British Dam Society, said the Whaley Bridge incident was similar to one at Oroville in California in 2017.

""A spillway was damaged, then the auxiliary spillway came into operation and there was erosion on the auxiliary spillway which meant they had to evacuate people downstream,"" he said.

While the failure of a dam could potentially kill hundreds or thousands of people, Mr Coackley said regular checks and maintenance, together with emergency plans, should prevent this.

""There are lots of people living below these dams and they are as safe as you can get,"" he said.

""It's not a disaster yet. Everything has gone according to plan with the Environment Agency and the emergency services all working with the inspecting engineer on what will be a pre-arranged plan.

""Every reservoir and dam has one of these plans in case of an emergency.""

Prof Wright said the evacuation was a precaution, but the right thing to do.

""There's always a chance that you will move people and then nothing will happen, but that's much better than not moving them and then something happens,"" he said.

Mr Coackley said engineers elsewhere would be looking at the implications of Toddbrook.

""There will be more checks. Dam engineers will be noting what's going on,"" he said.

""It's really important as an engineer to analyse why this has happened and make sure all of the other dams are safe"".",Whaley Bridge: How safe are Britain's dams?,"disaster, accident and emergency incident",emergency planning,827

The 35-year-old, who spent eight extremely successful seasons at City, left the club at the end of last season to join Greek side Olympiacos.

But things did not work out for the three-time Premier League winner at his new club. He made just two league appearances and started just a single game in his three months at the club, before his contract was terminated by mutual consent.

Toure however has no intentions to retire and has admitted he wants to make a comeback with a Premier League club.

“This is definitely not the end, I want to continue to play,” Toure said on Monday Night Football ahead of Manchester City’s match against Wolves.

“I went to Olympiacos and I quit because I was not so happy, the mentality was very different. It was a bad choice.

“Maybe it was an emotional choice because I started there and wanted to give something back to the fans.

“I'm well known in the world and wanted to give something back, but when I got there it was not what I was expecting.”

Toure added that he would like to return to England and envisions himself playing for another seven seasons.

""You never know, maybe the Premier League,” Toure said when asked where he wants to play next. “If it is possible I want to play one or two more years, we will see.

CPL Action states that, in April, a majority of Minnesota House lawmakers voted to mandate that every Pre-K-12 traditional public and charter school teach comprehensive sex ed.

“Democrats said the legislation focused on teaching ‘harassment’ and ‘consent,’” CPL Action continues. “But the curriculum includes pornographic images and unscientific ideas about gender, and it trivializes or even encourages high-risk and abusive sexual behavior.”

The group points to a book titled It’s Perfectly Normal, recommended by Planned Parenthood and intended for fourth graders, which describes “sexual intercourse” as “having sex” that “can involve the penis and the vagina, or the mouth and the genitals, or the penis and the anus.”

“[T]he book seems to encourage anal sex, and conflates this act with other types of sexual activity that carry a far-lower risk of injury and sexually transmitted infection,” CPL states.

In a video posted to Facebook in April, Rep. Eric Lucero (R) described the book to fellow state House lawmakers.

“I shared disgusting content from the book It’s Perfectly Normal and the Democrat agenda to sexualize the minds of our young children including Planned Parenthood’s goal of curriculum for elementary schools,” Lucero wrote.

According to CPL, when state Rep. Jim Davnie (D) insisted “Planned Parenthood is not in this bill,” state Rep. Peggy Scott (R) gave the response in this video clip:

I think it’s essential that members of the public, that parents and taxpayers, know that the sex education curriculum in this bill was written in part at least by Planned Parenthood. You can go to their website. They’re promoting this … and you can see some language that they think is important to have in sex ed curriculum and it’s verbatim what’s in this bill. So, members of the public need to understand that Planned Parenthood – a very controversial organization – is putting forth its agenda into our public schools. In fact, Planned Parenthood – they boast on their website about how they are already reaching “50,000 Minnesotans across the lifespan—including young people in elementary, middle, and high school, as well as parents and adults.”

Planned Parenthood Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota states on its website that the group is highly involved in sex ed in Minnesota, citing “trained educators throughout Minnesota provide sex education to youth and adults in their communities.”

“Planned Parenthood is the largest provider of comprehensive sex education in Minnesota,” Planned Parenthood says and adds:

U.S. Parents Involved in Education (USPIE), a national organization devoted to the return of local control of education, says in a says in a statement that CSE “is a blatant intrusion into a traditional family domain and a dangerous assault on the health and innocence of children.”

“We urgently encourage parents to retake control of their children’s sex education,” the group asserts, adding the type of CSE programs that are mandated by some states are “rights-based” approaches that are politically influenced.

79666,buzzfeed,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court announced Monday that it will decide whether it’s illegal under federal law for employers to discriminate against gay and transgender workers.

The case centers around Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bans discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex. The Supreme Court will determine whether “sex” applies to sexual orientation and gender identity as well.

If the Supreme Court rules in favor of the employees claiming discrimination, it will be an important win for LGBT advocates who have been advocating for protections under the Civil Rights Act for decades. It would also be a major hit for the Trump administration, which has openly advocated against the Civil Rights Act applying to LGBT individuals in hearings and briefs.

The court said Monday it will hear three cases on the issue: one from New York, one from Georgia, and one from Michigan. The New York and Georgia cases came to opposite conclusions about whether sexual orientation is protected by the Civil Rights Act. The Michigan case will examine whether gender identity is protected.

The New York case, Zarda v. Altitude Express Inc., was brought by a skydiving instructor claiming he was fired because he was gay. In February, a federal court of appeals for the 2nd Circuit ruled in favor of the employee, concluding that discrimination based on sexuality was a “subset of sex discrimination” because discriminating against someone for being attracted to someone of the same sex was, in part, based on what sex they are.

""A woman who is subject to an adverse employment action because she is attracted to women would have been treated differently if she had been a man who was attracted to women,"" the majority wrote in the New York appeals court decision. ""We can therefore conclude that sexual orientation is a function of sex and, by extension, sexual orientation discrimination is a subset of sex discrimination.""

A court in Georgia drew the opposite conclusion, however. A child welfare services coordinator claimed he was terminated for being gay, and the 11th Circuit Court in Atlanta ruled this was legal, citing a 1979 case that ruled the Civil Rights Act did not protect discrimination based on sexuality. Georgia’s ban on consensual sodomy wasn’t overturned until 1998.

When examining the third case, in Michigan, the Supreme Court will consider the separate but related question about whether gender identity is protected under federal law. The case was brought by Aimee Stephens who sued the funeral home where she worked for firing her after she announced she identified as a transgender woman and would start presenting outwardly as female.

The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Stephens, concluding that discriminating against an employee because they are transgender was illegal.

The New York and Michigan cases cited Supreme Court precedent that could help their arguments. In 1989 the Supreme Court ruled in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins that it was illegal to discriminate against workers because they did not conform to ideas of how a certain gender should behave.

Ann Hopkins had claimed she was denied a partnership at Price Waterhouse because she didn’t act feminine enough. The court ruled in that case that Price Waterhouse “had unlawfully discriminated against her on the basis of sex by consciously giving credence and effect to partners' comments about her that resulted from sex stereotyping.”

The Equal Opportunity Employment Commission, a federal agency, cited this precedent as well, in a hearing in the New York case in September, arguing that, “sex stereotyping says that if you are a man attracted to a man, or a woman attracted to a woman, you’re not behaving the way those genders are supposed to behave.”

The Justice Department countered this point in the same hearing, arguing that there is “a common-sense difference between sex discrimination and sexual orientation discrimination.”

The popular St Leonards teen will be remembered during the seven-a-side event at K-Park this Sunday – three days after his birthday – which aims to raise awareness of mental ill-health.

Alex, an apprentice mechanic, former pupil of Calderglen High and avid Motherwell FC supporter, died in his St Leonards home on July 8 last year.

He was described by his heartbroken family as the “most beautiful, handsome boy”. A minute’s applause was held at Fir Park for the dedicated member of fan group Motherwell Bois in the 18th minute of ’Well’s League Cup match with Edinburgh City on July 17 and banners were held aloft in his honour.

An online fund started by the fans raised over £7000 which was donated to a charity chosen by his parents Robbie and Jill.

The Alex Lindsay Cup is set to be an annual celebration of his life organised by close friends Jack Smith, 19, from St Leonards and 21-year-old Stewartfield man Joe McDermott.

More than 120 players have signed up to take part in the knockout tournament, including Alex’s dad Robbie, who will pull his boots on for five minutes in the first match in honour of his beloved son.

Robbie, 47, said: “We are once again overwhelmed by the generosity of so many, not least, Alex’s friends for arranging this tournament in his honour. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to those who have donated prizes and to those who will lend their support by attending the event on the day.”

As well as marking Alex’s birthday and passing, the lads are aiming to raise hundreds of pounds for Beautiful Inside and Out (BIO).

The charity was set up by Pauline Moriarty following the death of her daughter Jenna, who took her own life, and serves to offer support for those affected by suicide, especially youngsters.

Said Joe: “We wanted to set this up in Alex’s name because football was such a big part of his life. We miss him every day. There’s not a day that goes by that we don’t think of him.

754327,theindependent,"Paul Cheale, a pig breeder and abattoir owner, woke up to a farmer’s worst nightmare yesterday when he found his Essex property at the centre of Britain’s first outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease for 20 years.

His Cheale Meats Abattoir at Little Warley, near Brentwood, was doubly surrounded – by the yellow-and-black isolation tape of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and by TV crews and journalists wanting to know what had happened.

Mr Cheale looked shaken and could not keep the tremor out of his voice when he emerged to give his version of events. “We are devastated,” he said. “It is a real tragedy – the farming industry has been through BSE and swine fever and now we are faced with this.”

The disease was found on Monday in pigs which had been awaiting slaughter at his abattoir, after being brought from farms in Buckinghamshire and the Isle of Wight. It has also been found on neighbouring Old England farm, which Mr Cheale owns.

The area is at the edge of Greater London, on the featureless south Essex flatlands, but the abattoir takes animals from all over the country.

“On Monday we slaughtered 722 pigs, as is normal,” Mr Cheale said. “But we have a vet here all the time, and it was noticed that some animals were not quite right. We stopped the slaughter because we suspected it was swine vesicular disease – the symptoms are exactly the same as foot-and-mouth.

“Now as far as we know it’s definitely foot-and-mouth, and all of the stock and all of the meat will be destroyed. Yesterday we slaughtered the remainder of the animals – 284 pigs and two cattle.”

The stench of infected farms was only the beginning ... read part three

He now faces an intensive cleaning operation, involving the sterilisation of his premises, before he can even think about operating again, and yesterday he was trying to work out what it will mean to him financially – as this morning the whole UK farming industry will be doing.

“It’s obviously going to be expensive – it’s going to cost tens of thousands of pounds,” he said. “We are talking about hundreds of tons of meat being destroyed.

“We do get compensation, but we don’t get compensation for loss of production. The key question is – where did it all come from? It obviously came from an animal somewhere, but we don’t know where.”

Exclusion zones and checks are now operating around the two farms which supplied Cheale Meats. “So far there have been no confirmed cases of the disease here,” said Andrew Fidler, joint owner of Faringford Farm on the Isle of Wight. “The vets have been here looking at the animals, checking them out.

“We sent a load of pigs to this abattoir along with another farm on Friday. They were kept over the weekend and slaughtered on Monday when it was discovered that they were infected. It seems likely that our pigs were infected by pigs that had already been at the abattoir.

“The last few days have been OK apart from the fact that we cannot leave the farm. The kids are on holiday so they are not worried. The important thing is that it is sorted out.”

The anxiety the outbreak has provoked in Essex was evident with a neighbouring farmer, Scott Norris, who has 1,000 young pigs in a rearing unit just over a mile away – well within the five-mile no movement zone that has been established around the abattoir.

“We’ve not seen any problems as yet, and if it’s able to be nipped in the bud and doesn’t spread, it will all be over very quickly,” Mr Norris said. “But it will be of great concern if it spreads … We have had such a poor economic time with problems here and imports coming into our traditional markets, and disease problems have simply added to it.”

The pig industry is worried because it suffered more severely than any other sector in the financial crisis that hit British agriculture between 1998 and 2000. Global overproduction sent pig prices tumbling just when British pig producers faced higher costs because of new, stringent animal welfare legislation which has not yet been brought in by EU competitors.

It is believed that most British pig farmers made a loss in 1999. Then last year the industry was hit by an outbreak of classical swine fever in East Anglia, which, although contained, is estimated by the National Pig Association (NPA) to have cost it between £80m and £100m. “The new outbreak is hugely worrying for the pig industry,” said Ann Petersson, the NPA policy director. “We are still trying to pick ourselves up after the swine fever outbreak.”

Heart disease is far and away the number one killer in this country (some 1 in 4 deaths are associated with it). But cancer, lung diseases, and metabolic disorders such as diabetes aren't far behind.

Here is the good news-bad news situation, according to the report: ""While cardiovascular disease (CVD) death rates declined by approximately 36% from 2000 to 2014, CVD remains the leading cause of mortality among US adults.

22945,bbc,"A group of scientists has called for a ban on the development of weapons controlled by artificial intelligence (AI).

It says that autonomous weapons may malfunction in unpredictable ways and kill innocent people.

Ethics experts also argue that it is a moral step too far for AI systems to kill without any human intervention.

The comments were made at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Washington DC.

Human Rights Watch (HRW) is one of the 89 non-governmental organisations from 50 countries that have formed the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, to press for an international treaty.

Among those leading efforts for the worldwide ban is HRW's Mary Wareham.

""We are not talking about walking, talking terminator robots that are about to take over the world; what we are concerned about is much more imminent: conventional weapons systems with autonomy,"" she told BBC News.

""They are beginning to creep in. Drones are the obvious example, but there are also military aircraft that take off, fly and land on their own; robotic sentries that can identify movement. These are precursors to autonomous weapons.""

His company takes military contracts, but it has denounced AI systems for warfare and stated that it would not develop them.

""When they fail, they fail in unpredictable ways,"" he told BBC News.

""As advanced as we are, the state of AI is really limited by image recognition. It is good but does not have the detail or context to be judge, jury and executioner on a battlefield.

""An autonomous system cannot make a decision to kill or not to kill in a vacuum. The de-facto decision has been made thousands of miles away by developers, programmers and scientists who have no conception of the situation the weapon is deployed in.""

According to Peter Asaro, of the New School in New York, such a scenario raises issues of legal liability if the system makes an unlawful killing.

""The delegation of authority to kill to a machine is not justified and a violation of human rights because machines are not moral agents and so cannot be responsible for making decisions of life and death.

""So it may well be that the people who made the autonomous weapon are responsible.""",Call to ban killer robots in wars,politics,non-governmental organisation,359

Updated at 4:37 a.m. ET

Forty-nine people are dead and at least 20 are seriously injured in what New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says ""can now only be described as a terrorist attack.""

Two mosques in Christchurch were attacked Friday around the time of afternoon prayers. A male in his late 20s has been charged with murder, New Zealand Police Commissioner Mike Bush said. Three other people were apprehended, though one of those people might not have been involved in the shootings. Bush said it would be ""improper"" to confirm the identity of the person charged at this point.

Bush said police have recovered ""a number of firearms"" from both crime scenes. There were also ""possibly"" two improvised explosive devices on one vehicle, Bush said. Police have disabled one and are in the process of disabling the other, he said.

Bush said 41 people were killed at the Al Noor Mosque near Hagley Park in the city's center; seven were killed at a mosque in Linwood, a few miles away. One person taken to a hospital died from injuries sustained during the attack.

Ardern said the attack by people with ""extremist views"" was ""unprecedented — unlike any that we have experienced before.""

None of those in custody were on any active security watch lists, either in New Zealand or Australia, Bush said.

New Zealanders must continue to feel secure in their country, Ardern said. ""We represent diversity, kindness, compassion, a home for those who share our values, refuge for those who need it. And those values, I can assure you, will not and cannot be shaken by this attack.""

One of the individuals in custody is Australian, according to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.

Christchurch Hospital said it was treating 48 patients for gunshot wounds, CNN reported.

Bush said earlier that police haven't been able to identify the victims yet because the mosques are still on lockdown.

New Zealand Police say they have asked all mosques across the country to ""shut their doors.""

""It is clear this is one of New Zealand's darkest days,"" Ardern said earlier Friday. ""What has happened is an extraordinary and unprecedented act of violence.""

""Many of those affected may be migrants, maybe refugees ... They are us. ... The perpetrator is not. ... There is no place in New Zealand for such acts of extreme and unprecedented violence,"" Ardern said.

Bush urged anyone who had intended to visit a mosque in New Zealand not to go, to ""close your doors until you hear from us again."" The public was being urged to stay indoors.

Bush said he was aware of reports that the shooter had live-streamed an attack online. ""We are doing everything we can to remove it,"" he said.

This is a developing story. Some facts reported by the media may later turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from police officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene.

574781,tass,"In February, FIFA announced its decision to impose sanctions on Chelsea FC banning the English football club from registering new players, both at the domestic and international levels, for the period of the next two transfer windows. FIFA also ordered Chelsea FC to pay a fine of 600,000 Swiss francs (over $600,000).

MOSCOW, December 6. /TASS/. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled to reduce by half sanctions imposed by the world’s governing football body, FIFA, in regard to England’s football club Chelsea, a statement from the Swiss-based court announced on Friday.

According to the statement from CAS on Friday, the court in Lausanne decided that: ""CFC [Chelsea Football Club] is banned from registering any new players, either nationally or internationally, for one entire registration period, which the club already served during the 2019 summer registration period.""

""CFC is ordered to pay a fine to FIFA of the amount of CHF 300,000 (three hundred thousand Swiss Francs),"" the statement reads. ""The [FIFA’s] warning and the reprimand are confirmed.""

""A CAS arbitration procedure was initiated in June 2019, following the receipt of CFC’s appeal, and conducted by a Sole Arbitrator (Prof. Massimo Coccia (Italy)),"" the statement continued. ""The club did not file any application for provisional measures but requested that a final decision be rendered before the end of 2019. A hearing was held at the CAS headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 20 November 2019.""

The statement added that after the hearing the arbitrator in the case ""reduced the sanction to one single transfer ban (which Chelsea FC already served during the 2019 summer registration period), and halved the monetary sanction.""

FIFA stated in February that its Disciplinary Committee sanctioned English club Chelsea for breaches relating to the international transfer and registration of players under the age of 18.

According to the statement from FIFA, the club has breached regulations ""in the case of twenty-nine minor players and to have committed several other infringements relating to registration requirements for players."" The statement adds that Chelsea FC also breached regulations in ""connection with two agreements it concluded concerning minors and which allowed it to influence other clubs in transfer-related matters.""

Chelsea FC, which is owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, is currently ranked 4th with 29 points in this Premier League’s season after having played 15 matches.

237173,hitandrun,"""The age of climate panic is here,"" declared David Wallace-Wells, author of The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming (Tim Duggan Books), in a February 2019 New York Times op-ed. He's certainly right about the panic. University of Cumbria Professor of Sustainability Leadership Jem Bendell predicts that man-made climate change will result in a ""collapse in society"" in about 10 years. Novelist Jonathan Franzen has warned that it will soon produce ""massive crop failures, apocalyptic fires, imploding economies, epic flooding, hundreds of millions of refugees fleeing regions made uninhabitable by extreme heat or permanent drought.""

Are they right?

My first article in Reason related to global warming appeared in 1992. It was a report on the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, where the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was negotiated. By signing the treaty, I noted, the ""United States is officially buying into the notion that 'global warming' is a serious environmental problem"" even as ""more and more scientific evidence accumulates showing that the threat of global warming is overblown.""

But in subsequent decades, as I continued to cover the science and policy of global warming, I began slowly—too slowly for some—to change my mind. In 2006, I wrote that ""I now believe that balance of evidence shows that global warming could well be a significant problem.""

I have spent the last several months revisiting the question, trying to figure out if the current level of ""climate panic"" is scientifically justified. The earth is indeed warming. Climate researchers uncontroversially agree that the average global surface temperature has increased by about 1 degree Celsius since the 19th century. About half of that increase has occurred during the last 30 years. As the planet has warmed, mountain glaciers around the world have been shrinking, Arctic sea ice has been declining, rainstorms have become somewhat fiercer, the area affected by extreme droughts has been expanding, the amount of heat being absorbed by the world's oceans has been increasing, and the global sea level has been rising.

Past those points of scientific consensus, intense disputes begin straightaway. Researchers disagree about how much of the warming can be attributed to increases in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. They clash over which temperature records are more accurate with respect to how fast the earth is warming. They debate whether or not the sea level is rising at an accelerated rate that threatens to inundate many of the world's biggest cities. And they argue about whether the predictions generated by complicated climate computer models can be trusted enough to guide policy.

I have unhappily concluded, based on the balance of the evidence, that climate change is proceeding faster and is worse than I had earlier judged it to be. There are still big scientific uncertainties, such as just how sensitive the global climate is to a given increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. And the proper public policy remains far from clear. Still, most of the evidence points toward a significantly warmer world by the end of the century—probably more than 2 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial level. Such a temperature increase will definitely have substantial impacts on human beings. (For a more detailed review of current climate science, visit reason.com/climatedata.)

Man-made climate change is a global open-access commons problem. Since no one owns the atmosphere, no one has the incentive to expend effort protecting it from plundering. The ""tragedy of the commons"" occurs because every individual has an incentive to use the unowned resource before someone else does. The result is overconsumption, underinvestment, and ultimately depletion of the resource. This is happening around the world as many fisheries are declining, tropical forests shrinking, water shortages spreading, and rivers and airsheds growing more polluted. In this case, the resource being depleted is a (more or less) stable global climate.

It's time for market-oriented folks to recognize these facts and figure out the best way to handle them. If we don't offer solutions to the public, the only ones on the table will be those proposed by people who misunderstand economic principles or are unfriendly to market capitalism.

In an October Yale Climate Connections podcast, the Case Western Reserve University law professor (and Volokh Conspiracy blogger) Jonathan Adler explained it well. ""A lot of the expected and predictable consequences of climate change are things that we recognize to be violations of property rights and have recognized as violations of property rights for centuries,"" he said. ""If we accept that climate change is a problem, [and] if we accept that it's causing the sorts of rights violations that libertarians normally think justify government intervention, that should shift our discussion from whether there's a case for government intervention to what type of intervention and how do we maximize the likelihood that that intervention produces the sorts of results that we're trying to get.""

There are three ways to handle overexploitation in an open-access commons: privatize it, regulate it, or ignore it. All of those choices are inherently political decisions. ""The science"" does not tell us what must be done.

Most economists generally think of climate change resulting from the emission of greenhouse gases as a ""negative externality."" These occur when production and/or consumption of a good or service imposes uncompensated costs on third parties.

Nobelist Ronald Coase showed years ago that when there are well-defined property rights and minimal transaction costs, the party creating an externality and the party affected by the externality can negotiate with each other to bring about the socially optimal market quantity—in this case, a mutually agreeable level of emissions that takes into consideration the environmental harm being done without stopping economic growth and development. In addition, Coase found, it does not matter who holds the property rights, as long as someone does.

In the case of carbon dioxide emissions, the lack of assigned property rights in the atmosphere forestalls the sort of market transactions that balance costs with benefits. The price an individual pays for electricity for his home or gasoline for his car includes the monetary costs to extract, refine, and transport those fossil fuels—but it does not include the environmental costs of burning them. In a functioning market, users are obliged to internalize (i.e., pay for) the environmental costs they impose on others.

Europe's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) represents a kind of atmospheric privatization effort. Under the ETS, private companies are allocated tradable permits authorizing them to emit a ton of carbon dioxide for each allowance. Companies that can be productive while emitting less carbon sell their extra permits to other firms that find it more costly to make emissions cuts.

The aim of the ETS is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, so the number of permits declines over time. Recent research suggests, however, that the ETS has so far been only modestly effective at encouraging emissions reductions. It seems European political authorities allocated so many permits that prices have remained too low to prompt much cutting by emitters.

Another way to try to put a price on the external costs of carbon dioxide emissions is to impose a carbon tax. In January 2019, nearly 3,600 economists endorsed the ""Economists' Statement on Carbon Dividends,"" which explicitly supported such a plan.

""A carbon tax will send a powerful price signal that harnesses the invisible hand of the marketplace to steer economic actors towards a low-carbon future,"" the group declared. It ""will encourage technological innovation and large-scale infrastructure development"" while accelerating the spread ""of carbon-efficient goods and services.""

A huge plus for a carbon tax is that it would replace the current host of onerous and more costly top-down regulations and subsidies aimed at reducing emissions. Moreover, the revenue from the tax could ""be returned directly to U.S. citizens,"" the economists wrote, ""through equal lump-sum rebates. The majority of American families would benefit by receiving more in 'carbon dividends' than they pay in increased energy prices.""

Under the carbon dividend proposal, the tax would increase predictably over time. But economist Robert Litterman, the former head of risk management at Goldman Sachs, argues that the possibility of very unhappy surprises occurring as climate change proceeds over the course of the century constitutes an ""undiversifiable risk"" that should command a high risk premium. Consequently, Litterman's analysis suggests that an initially high (but revenue-neutral) carbon tax that declines as climate uncertainties are resolved would a better way to mitigate climate risk.

In February 2019, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D–N.Y.) introduced a resolution urging Congress to adopt the Green New Deal (GND), a sweeping plan to totally remake the American economy to address the climate crisis. The GND sets the goal of ""meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources"" by 2030.

Three of the leading Democratic candidates for president—Sens. Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.), and Kamala Harris (D–Calif.)—have endorsed the GND resolution, and each has proposed spending trillions of dollars over the next 10 years to implement comprehensive proposals addressing the problem of climate change. These include such steps as ""dramatically expanding and upgrading renewable power sources,"" building ""'smart' power grids,"" overhauling the U.S. transportation system by subsidizing electric-powered vehicles and public transit systems, and ""upgrading all existing buildings in the United States and building new buildings to achieve maximum energy efficiency.""

One obvious problem with the GND is its assertion, without evidence, that tackling climate change requires, among other things, guaranteeing every American a job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, retirement security, and the right to unionize, plus access to high-quality health care and affordable housing. But the effectiveness of even the climate-related aspects of the GND is dubious. For example, in a 2017 study, Swiss researchers calculated that a carbon tax rebated to taxpayers would cut the same amount of carbon dioxide emissions at about one-fifth the cost of the sort of top-down, command-and-control regulations and subsidies envisaged by the GND.

A more defensible suggestion would involve government support for new technologies that reduce emissions. ""The paramount goal of climate policy should be to make the unsubsidized cost of clean energy cheaper than fossil fuels so that all countries deploy clean energy because it makes economic sense,"" the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation argued in a 2014 report. Instead of rushing to deploy current expensive and inefficient low-carbon energy production methods, the ITIF researchers recommended that governments spend $70 billion annually on research and development seeking technological breakthroughs aimed at achieving dramatic cost reductions for nuclear power, carbon capture, fuel cells, smart grid technologies, electric vehicles, solar photovoltaics, wind power, and other forms of energy efficiency.

A downside of such a tech-push strategy is that energy breakthroughs are often unpredictable and governments don't have a great track record of seeing into the future. They also may not materialize fast enough to ameliorate the problems caused by climate change.

The basic premise of most climate agreements is that to prevent temperatures from increasing to possibly dangerous levels, all the countries of the world would have to agree to—and then abide by—a plan to dramatically cut their emissions. But this is probably both politically and economically unachievable. According to the nonprofit Climate Analytics group, if all countries meet all of their current pledges under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the average global temperature in the year 2100 would still increase by 3 degrees Celsius.

In October 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued Global Warming of 1.5 °C, a document that has come to be known as the Doomsday Report. It found that the world would have to cut its carbon dioxide emissions by 40 to 50 percent by 2030 and entirely eliminate such emissions by 2050 in order to keep the global average temperature from rising above 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100.

What would be gained by making such steep immediate cuts in emissions? Citing the results of integrated assessment models that combine climate and econometric data, the report noted, ""Under the no-policy baseline scenario, temperature rises by 3.66°C by 2100, resulting in a global gross domestic product (GDP) loss of 2.6%."" Meanwhile, under a 1.5 degree scenario, GDP would be reduced by 0.3 percent, and under a 2 degree scenario it would be reduced by 0.5 percent.

Different models come up with different estimates, and the IPCC noted that 3.66 degrees of warming could possibly reduce global GDP by anywhere from 0.5 percent to 8.2 percent. In other words, if humanity does nothing whatsoever to abate greenhouse gas emissions, the worst-case scenario is that global GDP in 2100 would be 8.2 percent lower than it would otherwise be.

Let's make those GDP numbers concrete. Assuming no climate change and a global real growth rate of 3 percent per year for the next 81 years, today's $80 trillion economy would grow to just under $880 trillion by 2100. World population is expected to peak at around 9 billion, so divvying up the total suggests that global average income would come to about $98,000 per person. Today, in comparison, that number is just $11,300.

Under the worst-case scenario, global GDP would be $810 trillion, and average income would be $90,000 per person. Folks two generations from now will be about eight times richer, giving them more wealth and better technologies with which to cope with the problems stemming from a much warmer planet.

Of course, any calculation projecting economic and climate outcomes nearly a century hence needs to be taken with a vat of salt. We can't be sure exactly what will happen—but there is a case for letting global warming run its course and letting markets figure out how to respond.

Continued economic growth and technological progress would surely help future generations to handle many—even most—of the problems caused by climate change. At the same time, the speed and severity at which the earth now appears to be warming make the wait-and-see approach increasingly risky.

Will climate change be apocalyptic? Probably not, but the possibility is not zero. So just how lucky do you feel? Frankly, after reviewing the scientific evidence, I'm not feeling nearly as lucky as I once did.

668338,theduran,"In the 1930s about 2% of young people in the United Kingdom went to university. That figure is now approaching 50%. In which era was it more of a distinction? It is patent that a degree has become declasse in both senses. I hear you say that only 2% of people went on to university in the 1930s because most people were financially obligated to leave school in their mid teens. University was simply not on the radar of most people. There is much truth in this. Further, you might argue that these days people receive more years of education and that is desirable. These people gain from tertiary education. Again there is some merit to this argument.

The Butler Education Act of 1944 provided for a huge expansion of third level education. This was predicated on the Beveridge Report of 1943. The report was prepared by the eponymous Sir William Beveridge. Not co-incidentally Sir William was Master of University College Oxford. He was also a Liberal MP. In those days Oxford and Cambridge provided half of all the university places in the United Kingdom. The Oxbridge dons who envisaged a major increase in the number of university places imagined that they would be founding more universities of a similar quality to Oxford and Cambridge. They were gravely. mistaken.

Until 1828 England had only two universities. Then University College London was founded. It was followed by Durham in quick succession. By the end of the century the major cities in England all had their own university – Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and so forth. Scotland had four universities dating back to the Middle Ages. Wales did not have a university until the late 19th century. Ireland had Trinity College Dublin since 1592.

In the early 1960s only 4% of young people went on to university. The government then contemplated a major expansion of higher education. Auberon Waugh harrumphed ‘more means worse’. It did not have to be so but that was the way it transpired. Universities could have been expanded without sacrificing quality. At first there was little reduction in standards. As we are to see in time standards were thrown out altogether.

The degree classification system was introduced at Oxford at the dawn of the 1800s. It rapidly spread throughout the realm and then the empire. Perhaps a tenth of graduates were awarded a first class degree. In some universities that figure is approaching 50%.

Undergraduates and postgraduates are wont to complain if they do not receive a 2:1 or first. It must have been the don’s fault. The student can only have been poorly taught. It cannot possibly be that he or she lacked the aptitude or application. In fairness, there is the occasional academic who is not good at teaching. But at university a student is expected to be an adult. He or she must taken responsibility for learning. In the good old days such complaints would not have been entertained. To become an academic in the UK a PhD is almost a prerequisite. There are additional qualifications in teaching for academics. These are very demanding so it is hard to imagine that a below part academic would slip through the net. Why do academics need a PhD? As recently as they 1990s there were quite a few who were plain mister or miss. The necessity of obtaining a doctorate is yet another symptom of qualification inflation. Not long ago if someone had a first from Oxford or Cambridge he or she might be offered a fellowship straightaway. The college knew that this person was bright enough. The young fellow would start to tutor immediately and write academic papers too.

In fairness there are some good reasons why grades appear to have been inflated. Yes grade inflation is real. But there is another factor. If someone graduated even 30 years ago he or she was in a small minority. A decently paying white collar job was all but assured. These days everyone worth his salt has a degree. Therefore, things are more competitive. Undergraduates are wont to study harder. A degree in itself is no passport to a job even a poorly paid one.

Academics have told me how they have to massage grades rather roughly. Management has a whip on their backs to do so.

There is no failure. It is called deferred success.

The rot set in decades ago. The rate of decline has sped up. It has been estimated that in 30 years time every single graduate will be awarded a first.

Thatcher said that undergraduates must be perceived as customers. They must get value for money. Universities are afraid of them. The students are the masters. It is a non-violent version of the Cultural Revolution in China.  A student can bang his fist on the table and demand this and that. The university does not want to upset a valued client.

The fundamental mistake has been to consider universities to be part of the economy. In previous centuries their role was regarded as educational. That is now seen as quaint. For Thatcher it was all profit and loss. She did not think education had any inherent value. Universities ought to be about learning not earning. If you want to get rich then go and make money. If you want to be educated go to university. It is possible to do both. But do not mistake the primary purpose of university.

To be fair to Thatcher she had a point when she said that certain universities were self-serving and unproductive. At Oxford and Cambridge some bibulous dons cared only for claret and conversation. They cared little for undergraduates whom they regarded as an annoyance at best. They produced few shoddy monographs. However, there were very few who were this bad. Maggie Thatcher also saw universities as being a nationalized industry. In fact universities were never state owned. She was suspicious of academics as left wingers. She was correct that a great many were and are left wing. More than a few are outright communists.

When John Major became prime minister the United Kingdom has roughly 40 universities. The UK also had about 40 polytechnics. A polytechnic could award a bachelor’s degree as its highest qualification. Polytechnics mostly gave diplomas and certificates. The students there generally studied technical subjects such as art, hairdressing, makeup, dance, metal work, woodwork, plumbing and technical drawing. In 1992 John Major decided on a complete overhaul. He was the least educated prime minister the UK ever had. James Callaghan had no higher education but he still cherished education and was widely read. Major proved himself to be a staggering ignoramus. He upgraded all the polytechnics to university status. At a stroke he hugely diminished the standing of British universities.

Printing more money does not enrich us all. Printing more degrees does not enrich us educationally. You might say I am not comparing like with like. If more people attain a high standard of education then though ought to be given a degree in recognition of that. Here I agree. I do not advocate returning to the 1930s when only 2% of people went to university. There has got to be a happy medium between that and the ludicrous situation we are in now when anyone can be awarded a degree. In the early 1980s we had it about right.

It is preposterous that universities can choose what degree class to award. There is clearly a conflict of interest here. It looks best for the university on the league table to award as many firsts as possible. Why wouldn’t you? Everyone else is doing it.

If you are a student and you see people complain and get higher grades you might be tempted to likewise. You would be a fool not to. FIDDLE the system.

Universities need students. How do they attract them? Providing superb education from distinguished academics ought to be the way. There are less noble strategies. Award high classes of degree to as many as possible. Do not fail any student no matter how idle or incapable. Give them freebies. Some hand out free laptops. But there is no such thing as a free lunch. These students are in debt for university. It will have to be paid back. In fact these people are burdening themselves with tens of thousands of pounds of debt. The government estimates a third of it will never be repaid. It is driving up the deficit. It is also taking money away from the NHS and armed forces.

I am not demeaning people in their teens and early 20s. There are just as many gifted young people as ever. Many of them are diligent. Their achievements should not be belittled. The trouble is that it is hard to tell who is a high achiever from class of degree. There are some who truly deserve a first. There are others who do not. Awarding first class degrees to second class students does a disservice to those who genuinely merit firsts.

Money is squandered on glossy advertising. Brochures have said how many one night stands students have. I am not judgmental about promiscuity. I am simply saying it should not be part of a university’s pitch.

When Thatcher became PM 10% of people went to university. Full funding was feasible. As the number of people in higher education reached 50% of youngsters the same level of funding was unaffordable.

Treating universities as businesses is fundamentally wrong. The approach to degrees has been stack em high sell em cheap. They are cheap in the sense that they are easy. Conversely their price has increased markedly.

It is hard to believe that until the late 1990s undergraduates paid not a penny in fees. Further, they were even given maintenance grants in the early 1990s. Even if your parents were millionaires you were given money to live on by the government. It was not a loan.

The amount of money that the government spends on undergraduates is lower in real terms than ever before. Yet we are told the results are better than ever. Smell a rat? This is utterly impossible.

Full disclosure: I was awarded a 2:1 in my first bachelor’s degree in 1999. Had I done it 10 years earlier I probably would have got a 2:2. Had I done it now I might even have landed a first. In my second bachelor’s I was given a 2:2. Ten years earlier that would have been a third. Nowadays would it be a 2:1? I did a master’s and was awarded a 2:2. I should not even have been admitted to the course. The course director assured me that no one fails. There is not bottom line!

In my linguistics MA I was taught the parts of speech! Admittedly there were some challenging parts of the course too.

There are structured PhDs. Having so much helps defeats the objective of a PhD.

When business imperatives and educational imperatives collide it is the former that wins out every single time. Educational standards will always be sacrificed to market forces. It is all a sham.

Master’s degrees used to be a rarity. Now they are handed out like billy-o.

Armies of substandard graduates are around. Unsurprisingly they cannot find jobs commensurate with their qualifications. Put simply there are only so many graduate jobs. ‘But we paid for our degrees’. You cannot buy a brain.

Academic freedom is under attack. Woe betide any academic with the courage to say that people are all too often grades that their work does not merit.

The ridiculous ‘Rhodes must fall’ campaign took place at Oxford. Some snowflakes demanded the removal of the statue of a 19th century imperialist. These students could have chosen not to apply to Oxford if the statue was so offensive. In a rare example of backbone the university refused to remove the image. All too often universities bow the knee to bully boy tactics. There are safe spaces and trigger warnings. Muslims students often vociferously complain about anything that reflects poorly on Islam.

Academic pay is abysmal and so is there status. In a marked contrast the administrators are paid higher than ever. It is all about bums on seats. The more students the more money.

Much money is wasted on aesthetics. Students have better accommodation than ever. That is not a bad thing.  But it is not a sensible way to spend money. These student halls are empty half the time. This exacerbates the housing crisis.

You can perform abysmally in school and still get a degree. I knew 18 year olds who were semi-literate. Shockingly they were later awarded degrees. People who failed all their A levels are sometimes accepted by universities. Why should they run when they cannot walk? Failing all your A levels really takes some doing.

We ought to accept that most people are not academic. There is no shame in that. We cannot all be scholars just as we cannot all be athletes or musicians. Some lucky souls can be all of these things. Gifts are not distributed equally.

Many people have been sold a pup. They have been conned into thinking that taking on £40 000 of debt for an almost worthless degree will guarantee them a handsomely remunerated job. Notice that educational benefits are hardly mentioned in a university’s pitch.

The big idea is that sending masses of people to ‘uni’ will boost the economy. There is little truth in this. In fact all this unmanageable debt is a drain on the economy. The Republic of Ireland has the highest university attendance rte in the world. That did not stop the crash of 2008. Some very prosperous nations have low graduation rates: Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands have it about 20%. There are countries with much higher university attendance rates like Georgia that are not rich at all.

Some well meaning left wing politicians in the 1960s set the ball rolling. In many cases they grew up working class. Third level education had been all but inaccessible to their parents. The Labour politicians wanted to bring the blessings of higher education to more people. It was a praiseworthy goal. But they were overzealous and went too far.

There has been a Dutch auction on standards. Students achieve less because less is expected of them. Universities ought to have exacting standards. A little failure in your teens is good for you. It inoculates a person against the adversity he or she will encounter in the workplace.

There are superb universities in the UK but very few. Much depends on the subject. Medicine and Veterinary Medicine are truly scholastic subjects. Standards for these subjects remain very high.

Course are dumbed down and stripped of difficult content. With new subjects there is no agreed corpus of knowledge. So they can be dumbed down more easily. What is media studies? No one knows. Therefore it can be made easier without giving the game away. In Chemistry you cannot do without the Periodic Table of Elements. That is why traditional subjects have not been gutted in the same way new fangled ones have. Note how the UK has fewer graduates in STEM subjects precisely because they cannot be made too simple.

We have in some respects experienced the Americanisation of higher education. The US has some of the top universities in the world. But even in the Ivy League there is corruption. Legatees are accepted due to bribes. Sorry I mean donations. Academic freedom is curtailed. There is a marriage of convenience between regressive capitalism and far left cultural theory. Academics dare not transgress certain mores or their careers are over. University is more expensive than ever but less worthwhile. As they say a century ago college taught ancient Greek. Now it teaches remedial English. At least in the US the government is not paying for all this bunkum.

The government gives the university less money than ever but demands more control. The government wants to bring in racist discrimination as policy. There are codes of conduct. Free speech is under assault. Students are to be mollycoddled. They cannot get up to high jinks. They are subjected to sub Marxist and feminist indoctrination. These are loony left fads from the United States.

In schools the same malaise has played out. Grade inflation plagues schools. A new grading system has sought to hide this. Tonnes of bureaucracy have ruined schooling and driven out many excellent teachers.

O levels were hard. In 1988 they became GCSEs which we much easier. Too many people got an A grade. Then an A * was introduced. The same happened to A levels. So many people got an A * that they whole system has been scrapped. The UK is returning to a numerical system it had in the 1970s. This time 9 is the best grade and 1 is the worst. It is permanent revolution. No wonder people are confused.

These problems have been around for decades. Michael Gove as Education Secretary made a small attempt to reverse grade inflation. There were howls of outrage.

As Gove said 50% of children are below average but try telling that to a middle class London parent. I did once and the woman was genuinely perplexed.#

All must have prizes! It is like Garrison Keeler’s satire about Lake Woebegone. The average is high and everyone is above it.

I am not being snooty about my abilities. I am a disaster in several subjects. If I had been around in the time of O levels I would have failed Maths, Latin and perhaps other subjects.

Why are school grades higher when everyone stays in school till 18 now? Grade inflation is the main factor. There are others. There is teaching to test.

It is extremely hard to become a teacher. It is organizationally difficult. It is not scholastically challenging. There are some brilliant and dedicated teachers. Schools vary enormously. But in many of them teachers are verbally abused non stop. Small wonder there is a teacher recruitment crisis. It is very hard to get science graduates to teach.

For 20 years Oxford had to teach Maths students extra classes before the start of term. That is because school Maths is no longer taxing enough. Universities say they cannot identify brilliant applicants because hordes of pupils have all top grades.

An academic at a London university told me a third of his undergraduates should not be there. Sullen and idle they will denounce him to the authorities if he does not give them a 2:1 or better for each essay. It is not all gloom. There are cerebral and hard working students as there always were.

University education ought to be pared back. So much money could have saved. The UK has two of the most renowned universities on the planet. We ought to view Oxford and Cambridge as national treasure. The government should be happy to pay whatever it takes to maintain their status. But the government is chicken shit. They bow to populist prejudice. They fail to fund varsity properly.

As for grades – it is no use awarding a first to 50% of students even if they have attained the requisite standard. A degree class is partly to tell people apart. Therefore there must be a cap on the % who can be awarded each class. Cheap popularity by awarding higher and higher grades much end.

The UK needs rigour in school exams. A law to prevent grade inflation must be introduced – i.e. a cap on the % who can get each grade.",The higher education scam,education,vocational education,3214
543650,sputnik,"To call a snap election, the government needs 434 votes - two-thirds of all legislators elected to the 650-seat lower house of the UK parliament. In a vote in the early hours of Tuesday, only 293 lawmakers backed the government's proposal.

The vote came just before a five-week suspension of parliament, a move announced earlier by Johnson.

""Once again, the opposition think they know better"", Johnson said in the early hours of Tuesday, right after the vote.

Nevertheless, the prime minister immediately announced that he would make another proposal to hold snap elections in the near future. Opposition officials said that they would discuss holding snap parliamentary elections only after Johnson agreed with Brussels on the postponement of Brexit and on the terms of the withdrawal agreement.

Johnson told the UK parliament on Monday, ahead of a vote on whether a snap election should be held, that an election is the only way to break the deadlock over Brexit.

""Mr. Speaker, I am re-tabling a motion for an early date general election, I don't want it, I hoped this step would be unnecessary [...] Yet I have accepted the reality that an election is the only way to break the deadlock in the House (of Commons) and to serve the national interest by giving whoever is prime minister the strongest possible mandate to negotiate for our country at next month's European council"", Johnson said, cited by Reuters.

Johnson said that if Parliament did not vote for a snap election, he would go to the EU summit next month seeking to agree on a deal, but would not ask for another delay to Brexit.

""I will not ask for another delay"", Johnson said Monday.

UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn argued on Monday, ""we are not walking into traps laid by this prime minister"", noting that Johnson is trying to take the country ""over a cliff of a no-deal exit"", adding it will damage the poorest and most vulnerable in the country.

""Until [...] no-deal has been taken off the table... we will not vote to support the dissolution of this house and a general election [...] We're eager for an election. But as keen as we are, we are not prepared to risk inflicting the disaster of no-deal on our communities"", Corbyn told Parliament in a debate about holding the snap election.

UK lawmakers also voted earlier on Monday in favor of forcing the government to publish its planning documents for a no-deal Brexit scenario. Members of parliament voted 311 to 302 in favor of the motion earlier in the day.

The UK government now has until Wednesday 11:00 p.m. (22:00 GMT) to publish all correspondence, including informal communications via Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram.

Earlier on Monday, a bill aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit in late October became law after receiving the formal assent of Queen Elizabeth II. The bill aims to avoid leaving the European Union without a deal.

The legislation forces UK Prime Minister Johnson to ask for a delay unless a deal has been agreed with the bloc or the parliament votes for a no-deal Brexit by 19 October.

On Friday, UK opposition parties agreed to protest Johnson's plan for a snap election, seeking to avoid it taking place prior to the 31 October Brexit deadline.

Currently, Brexit is at a standstill. The country’s parliament is opposed to the agreement with the European Union in its current form, but is also unilaterally opposed to a no-deal Brexit. The European Union has refused to resume negotiations and revise the agreement. Johnson insists that the United Kingdom will leave the European Union as scheduled, on 31 October, with or without a deal.",UK Lawmakers Reject Snap Parliamentary Election,politics,government,598
1143,abcnews,"The State Department announced Thursday it was calling back nearly all staff next week and paying them for a two-week period, but a growing number of U.S. diplomats are frustrated by the partial government shutdown and the damage it’s inflicting on their jobs and America’s standing abroad.

While they’ll be paid for this pay period, several diplomats are calling on the administration to fully reopen the government, as they struggle to interact with counterparts abroad and pay their own bills. Employees have been either furloughed and sent home or are working with no pay and limited in what kind of work they can conduct.

“Morale is pretty rock bottom,” said a Foreign Service officer based in Europe, “And this is among a really dedicated, really patriotic bunch of people who are unfortunately getting these messages that what they’re doing is not important or that they’re not valuable enough to have somebody figure out how to get them paid.”

Amid an eight-country tour of the Middle East, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sought to assure his department’s rank and file serving at missions overseas and working to support his trip while not being paid because of the government shutdown.

“We’re doing our best to make sure it doesn’t impact our diplomacy,” Pompeo said of the shutdown while in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.

“Morale is good,” he added, and said, staff “understand that there are squabbles in Washington, but their mission remains, their duties continue, and they’re executing them.”

While the plan to pay staffers has changed for the next two weeks, the uncertainty of what could come after that -- if the shutdown continues for that long -- has unnerved diplomats and their foreign counterparts.

“It is an embarrassment to the country. I have had multiple [foreign counterpart] contacts asking how does this happen in the U.S.,” said another Foreign Service officer.

Approximately 23 percent of U.S. employees overseas and 40 percent in the U.S. have been furloughed, according to a State Department spokesperson. But because of the shutdown, employees have been limited in their ability to meet with foreign counterparts or provide assistance to U.S. companies working in their host country. They’ve been forced to cancel or decline invitations to events or meetings.

“You don’t sort of put diplomacy on hold, and I think that we’re going to look back at this period with a lot of regret for sort of missed opportunities,” said the diplomat based in Europe.

That’s because the department is forced to prioritize “the protection of the United States’ critical national security interests and the safety of U.S. citizens abroad” over other functions, according to the spokesperson, who is among those still working but without pay. Even with the new pot of funding for salaries, department activity will be limited to this scope, with limits on employee travel and engagement.

That pay will also only run for the next two weeks before the department will have to consult with Congress on moving additional funds to cover salaries. In addition, employees will not yet be paid for the first month of the shutdown -- until fiscal year 2019 appropriations are approved and back pay can kick in.

While the department could have taken this step to pay employees as soon as the shutdown started, it didn’t largely because no one anticipated the shutdown to last this long.

""It has become clear as the lapse has continued to historic lengths that we need our full team to address the myriad critical issues requiring U.S. leadership around the globe and to fulfill our commitments to the American people,"" a State Department spokesperson told ABC News. ""We are also deeply concerned about growing financial hardship and uncertainty affecting Department employees whose salaries and well-being are affected by the unprecedented length of the lapse.""

Even amid the shutdown, staff had to support Pompeo’s week-long Middle East tour while not being paid -- a trip that required more staff than usual to work for his wife Susan, who traveled with him and had her own schedule of meetings and activities. The secretary said his wife was on ""an important mission ... trying to help the State Department be better"" by touring embassy facilities and living conditions and making recommendations for improvements.

Consular operations like visa and passport services have remained open because they are supported by the fees folks pay for them, but some could be at risk of closing or scaling back hours if they do not have sufficient fees.

Certain operations within the agency have also remained open because of residual funds, including Diplomatic Security, Overseas Buildings Operations, and International Narcotics and Law Enforcement.

But with fewer employees in the office, staff have had to pick up more work. Conversations have been turned to what tasks should be prioritized, instead of getting that greater amount of work done with less staff, one official in Washington said, adding, “People are starting to snap at each other in meetings.”

Diplomats sometimes spend a year in language training ahead of a new posting, but those classes have also halted -- even though diplomats will ship out to post at the same time. That means they will be less prepared when their position starts later this year.

While some federal employees in the U.S. have turned to side gigs, those based at U.S. missions abroad are not allowed to do so.

The shutdown could also start to pose a security risk, some have warned.

“We have tens, if not thousands of USG [U.S. government] employees with security clearances not getting a paycheck. Can only imagine that the Russians, Chinese and others are licking their lips at the prospect of there being a lot of people in need of cash,” said one U.S. diplomat based in Eastern Europe.

“USG employees are so incredibly dedicated and patriotic, and here our own government is putting them in a precarious situation,” they added.

Department employees are expected to receive back pay after the shutdown ends.

One U.S. diplomat quipped that even quitting would be difficult because the shutdown means that there is no one working to fund moving families home -- something guaranteed to all diplomats.","Shutdown hits US diplomats overseas, even as State Department calls employees back",labour,employment,1004

326471,nationalinterest,"Long-term unemployment is no longer a serious social policy problem, but standard, full time, long-term employment is also much less common.

Ken Loach’s film, Sorry We Missed You, tells the harrowing tale of Ricky, Abby and their family’s attempts to get by in a precarious world of low paid jobs and the so-called “gig economy”.

But how realistic is it? Can Loach’s film be accused of undue pessimism? After all, UK government ministers have applauded the gig economy and the freedom and flexibility of being an “everyday entrepreneur”.

A new study by myself and employment expert Andreas Giazitzoglu investigates what we know about the gig economy, in order to get a clearer picture of what is really going on in the contemporary world of work in the UK.

Narrowly conceived, the gig economy means workers (as independent contractors) doing discrete, short-term tasks – or “gigs” – for companies via digital platforms such as Deliveroo, Amazon or Uber. As one study describes them, these are “labour contracts that are as temporary as is possible for them to be”.

We argue that it is better to see the gig economy as part of a wider shift towards insecure forms of work. Long-term unemployment is no longer a serious social policy problem, but standard, full time, long-term employment is also much less common.

More and more people are churning from “one shit job to another shit job”, as Ricky puts it in Loach’s film, punctuated with periods of unemployment. And as Loach observed (in a Q&A session following a preview), Sorry We Missed You is a sequel to the 2016 film I, Daniel Blake, which explores the degradations of the UK’s benefit system.

These are two sides of the same coin, as research on “the low-pay, no-pay cycle” has shown. Many of these jobs are on zero-hours contracts, which although illegal across much of the EU, have boomed in the UK.

Read more: We showed I, Daniel Blake to people living with the benefits system: here's how they reacted

There were fewer than 200,000 of these contracts in 2007. Ten years later, in 2017, there were over 1.8m.

Employers insist that workers want this “flexibility”. But two-thirds would prefer a fixed-hours contract.

The government celebrates high levels of employment but two-thirds of employment growth since the 2008 financial crash has been in self-employment or other forms of “atypical work”. Much of this self-employment appears to be bogus. Just like in Sorry We Missed You, employers designate workers as “independent contractors” to cut wage costs and employment rights

Investigative journalism has exposed the degraded work conditions of “self-employed” delivery drivers like Ricky: intense pressure to meet delivery schedules, breaking speed limits, snatching meals on the run, urinating into plastic bottles rather than stopping, barely making the national minimum wage.

Even a government inquiry found that “some companies are using self-employed workforces as cheap labour”, damaging workers’ well-being in order to “increase profits”.

If not bogus, then much self-employment is likely to be “forced”, perceived as the only alternative to being unemployed. This was typical of the “young entrepreneurs” I interviewed in the 1980s.

Held up as role models for Margaret Thatcher’s “enterprise culture”, their ambitions were, in fact, much more prosaic. Rather than go on the dole, they used the (recently re-launched) Enterprise Allowance Scheme to set up “micro-businesses” – knitting jumpers, repairing bicycles, freelance photography – keeping going by undercutting other businesses and by gross self-exploitation. Very few succeeded over the long term.

Most plodded along until, exhausted, demoralised and in debt, they closed down their businesses. Low pay is also typical of more recent forced self-employment and has been a key factor in the UK’s shift towards low paid work.

Across the research, we found ten things that were common to workers’ experiences of this new, insecure labour market:
• Modest aspirations (people were not looking to get rich quick but wanted regular work and to be able to pay the bills)
• Disempowerment (employers now have “disciplinary discretion” to withhold offers of work to people on zero-hours contracts)

One of the duties of critical social science is to question fashionable ideas. We should be particularly alert when comfortably placed, middle-aged politicians exhort younger people to “take up opportunities” that they themselves would never dream of going near.

Would government ministers be quite so “excited” about the gig economy if they had to surrender their fixed salaries, paid holidays and pension schemes in favour of working a daily schedule so gruelling that toilet stops are impossible and the minimum wage cannot be earned?

All of us – the public who rely on the services of the gig economy just as much as the politicians who proclaim its virtues – need to wake up to the reality that, in this instance, “flexibility” is just another word for exploitation.

896,abcnews,"Like millions of Americans suffering from bone loss, Lorice Cortez embraced the prescription drug Fosamax with the hope of stopping osteoporosis in its tracks.

But in August 2009 -- a decade after she began regularly taking the medicine produced by pharmaceutical giant Merck -- Cortez said she experienced a painful and debilitating side effect: a spontaneous broken leg.

As the 70-year-old turned to unlock the front door of her house, she heard a “popping sound, then suddenly felt her left leg give out from beneath her,” according to court documents. In an instant, with no trauma or impact, she completely fractured her thighbone, requiring surgery to repair the break.

Monday the Supreme Court hears arguments in a case brought by Cortez and more than 500 Fosamax users from 45 states trying to sue Merck for damages after experiencing atypical femoral fractures, which they allege were caused by the drug.

The plaintiffs contend the company failed to warn them or their doctors of the danger, despite early evidence suggesting the increased potential for spontaneous bone breaks without any previous stress.

Merck does not dispute the heightened risk of femoral fractures in long-term users of Fosamax and has included a warning with prescriptions since 2010. But the company argues it cannot be held liable for damages in state courts because the Food and Drug Administration in 2009 rejected a proposed warning to patients.

“If a manufacturer proposes to warn about a risk, discloses what it knows about that risk, and gets rebuffed by the FDA, failure-to-warn claims against it are preempted as a matter of law,” Merck argues in its brief filed with the high court.

A federal district court and a circuit court of appeals divided on whether the FDA’s decision in 2009 preempts the patients’ claims or whether a jury must consider the facts of the case, weighing the FDA’s intent and whether Merck should have proposed different warning language.

Cortez “would not have used Fosamax for so many years had [Merck] properly disclosed the risks associated with its long-term use,” her lawyers wrote in a suit against the company.

Manufacturers are required by law to inform patients of potential adverse reactions to their drugs as soon as reasonable evidence exists. But the FDA has ultimate authority to approve or reject the wording that appears on drug labels.

In a 2008 application to the FDA, Merck proposed revising the warning language for Fosamax, describing a heightened risk of “stress fractures.”

One year later, the FDA rejected that draft language, saying the warning was “not warranted and is not adequately supported by the available literature” and asked for revised language.

Merck said the FDA’s conclusion, based on available evidence at the time, means the company cannot be held liable for failing to warn consumers as required under state law because the federal government wouldn’t allow it.

“Merck never proposed a warning of ‘atypical femoral fractures’ to the FDA,” the plaintiffs argue in their brief to the Supreme Court. “In an attempt to minimize the risk, Merck proposed to warn of ‘stress fractures,’ which are widely understood as minor fractures far less serious than atypical femoral fractures.”

Currently, Fosamax carries a warning of “atypical femoral fractures” -- the type of injury Cortez and hundreds of others endured -- making no mention of the term “stress fractures.” The FDA mandated the change in 2010 after mounting evidence of a link to the drug.

“The FDA was so concerned -- and had no response back from Merck -- that they convened their own panel to reexamine the evidence,” said Suzanne Robotti, founder and president of MedShadow Foundation, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. “It recommended that a strong warning be put on there specifically describing spontaneous fractures. It was Merck’s responsibility to propose that warning themselves.”

The company maintains that there was insufficient evidence prior to 2010 to support a stronger warning for Fosamax. In an amicus brief filed to the Supreme Court, the Trump administration’s FDA backs up their claim.

Merck has “incontrovertible proof, from the agency’s own mouth, that it would not have authorized respondents’ proposed warning until October 2010,” the company argues to the court.

“If manufacturers must face tort suits, even when the FDA has made clear that no warning is necessary, they will continue to face an onslaught of troubling coercive litigation,” Merck says.

Patient advocates say a jury should be allowed to decide.

“If they are successful with this, other drug companies would obviously follow the exact same path: they would put in language to the FDA that they anticipate and hope would be rejected,"" said MedShadow's Robotti. ""But it’s really not the FDA’s job to write the drug label, it’s the pharmaceutical company’s job to write the drug label.""

Between the 24-hour news cycle, the internet, and the smartphone the world has never been so saturated with information. Yet a new report by CARE International finds that humanitarian crises affecting millions of people around the world snagged relatively few headlines last year.

The report, “Suffering in Silence,” also found that climate change played a direct role in at least five of the 10 most underreported humanitarian crises of 2018, from chronic droughts in Ethiopia to Typhoon Mangkhut in the Philippines. The tally underscores how the developing world, which has less historical responsibility for the emissions that cause climate change, is feeling its effects earliest and hardest.

In Madagascar, which the report describes as being at the front line of climate change, drought and unfavorable weather conditions have withered crops, while food prices hover close to record highs. Malnutrition is already rampant in Madagascar, which will likely be compounded by crop failure. Almost half of Madagascar’s children are stunted, which can hurt their cognitive and mental growth for the rest of their lives. Madagascar was ranked as the third most underreported crisis on the list.

The report looked at man-made or natural disasters affecting more than 1 million people, then analyzed online media reports to weigh the coverage they received. While the earthquake in Haiti made international headlines in 2010, the country’s chronic food shortages were the most underreported crisis of last year, the study found. Haiti was ranked fourth on the 2018 Long-Term Climate Risk Index, and the country is still struggling to recover from droughts in northern areas at the beginning of last year. Frequent natural disasters and extreme poverty have left half of the country facing the continued threat of extreme hunger, with almost a quarter of children in Haiti chronically malnourished.

Wars and revolutions galvanize global attention. Long-term droughts don’t. A lack of news coverage has real-world consequences, said Sven Harmeling, CARE International’s global policy Lead on climate change and resilience.

“If there is not enough media attention, it often means that there is a lack of political attention in terms of confronting the causes of the problem, but also in delivering the support and help that the people affected need,” he said. Cutbacks in news organizations’ foreign bureaus, he noted, have affected the ability of newsrooms to maintain their coverage of these crises.

While refugee and migrant flows to Europe and the United States have dominated headlines in the West in recent years, the report notes that over 80 percent of the world’s refugees currently live in developing countries. Niger, one of the poorest countries in the world, currently hosts over 170,000 refugees from neighboring Nigeria and Mali. In Niger, which CARE International ranks eighth on the list of underreported crises, this has further strained a country already battling chronic food insecurity.

The report, which makes clear how climate change can reshape the security environment, comes at a time with the United States has stepped back from global efforts to combat climate change. President Donald Trump has withdrawn the United States from the Paris agreement on climate change, undone a number of Obama-era climate change policies, and appointed a former coal industry lobbyist to run the Environmental Protection Agency. Most recently, he appointed a climate change skeptic to lead a White House initiative to denigrate the security threat from climate change that his own Pentagon is busy preparing for.

In January, Trump posted a tweet mocking global warming as large parts of the United States braced for winter storms.

“The evidence and scientific facts are so clear that not acting is coming close to a crime against humankind,” said Harmeling of CARE International.

One big problem: The places most likely to suffer as climate change intensifies are the ones with the least ability to gather the kind of detailed data that could help build predictive models.

“In the places where we see the biggest vulnerability, the highest human suffering, we are least able to provide precise numbers,” said Maarten van Aalst, the director of the International Red Cross/Red Crescent Climate Centre.

Van Aalst, along with the U.S. military and intelligence community, stresses that many global disasters are caused by a confluence of factors, of which climate change is just one ingredient. “Climate change is acting as a risk magnifier for many of these disasters, but we shouldn’t blame climate change on its own,” he said.

Still, it’s a devastating magnifier, especially where infrastructure is weak and resilience is weaker.

“The first climate shock erodes vulnerability further, so the second shock hits people even harder and erodes vulnerability even further, so that the third shock is an even bigger killer,” van Aalst said.",There’s More Bad News Than You Think,politics,non-governmental organisation,769

Firouzja, 16, had decided not to play for his country in an apparent reaction to the Islamic republic’s ban on competing against Israeli players.

Iran does not recognize Israel, and Iranian sports teams have employed a policy of not competing against Israelis for the past several decades.

“Congratulations to Alireza Firouzja on a fantastic silver medal. And shame on all those who seek to thwart his career,” FIDE Vice President Nigel Short said on Twitter on December 28.

There was no immediate reaction from Iranian authorities.

Firouzja, widely praised as a chess prodigy, is the second Iranian sports figure in recent months to try to renounce his citizenship over state pressure on Iranian athletes to forego matches with Israeli competitors.

In October, Iran was banned from international judo competitions indefinitely over the country's refusal to face Israeli competitors. The decision by the International Judo Federation (IJF) came after Iranian judoka Saeid Mollaei said he was pressured to drop out of bouts to avoid facing an Israeli opponent.

""Firouzja has made his decision and has told us that he wants to change his nationality,"" the president of Iran's Chess Federation, Mehrdad Pahlavanzadeh, told the semiofficial news agency Tasnim last week.

Firouzja and his father are currently living in France.

In April, Iranian media reported that Firouzja had refused to play against an Israeli player in a tournament in Germany.

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has praised athletes who have refused to face opponents from Israel.

3640,abcnews,"(RNS) — On a Sunday morning in May of 1969, as clergy processed into the sanctuary of New York’s august Riverside Church, civil rights activist James Forman vaulted into the pulpit to demand $500 million in reparations for the mistreatment of African Americans from white churches and synagogues.

At the time, Forman’s interruption represented the high point for the reparations movement. A week before, Forman had debuted a radical proposal for racial justice known as “the Black Manifesto” for 500 black activists gathered in Detroit for the National Black Economic Development Conference.

“(W)e know that the churches and synagogues have a tremendous wealth,” the manifesto stated, “and its membership, white America, has profited and still exploits black people.

”The conference determined, by a 187-63 vote, that it was time for white Christians and Jews to pay reparations and demonstrate a willingness to fight “the white supremacy and racism which has forced us as black people to make these demands.

”Riverside, then a mostly white liberal Protestant congregation whose neo-Gothic landmark building was financed by John D. Rockefeller Jr., would be deeply divided over the next few years over Forman’s challenge. As the activist brought his manifesto to other congregations and denominations, Riverside established a lecture series and a “Fund for Social Justice” that aimed to raise $450,000 over three years to help the poor in the local community. It fell short of the goal by almost $100,000.

The Black Manifesto’s demands never caught fire in the broader U.S. religious community. The Rev. Gayraud Wilmore, a black Presbyterian leader in New York City in 1969, recalled 50 years later how religious institutions responded.

“I saw them withering and unable to step forward and say ‘Let’s be the church,’” said Wilmore, now 98. “I saw no bold action taken on our side to go along with the bold action Forman was taking.

”Five decades later, the reparations debate has reentered the national spotlight, with some religious institutions leading the way.

Earlier in December, Reform Jews, declaring that “racial inequity is present in virtually every aspect of American life,” voted overwhelmingly to support a U.S. commission to develop proposals for reparations and urged conversations in their congregations to redress systemic racism.

In recent months, Virginia Theological Seminary, Princeton Theological Seminary and Georgetown University have all announced plans to fund initiatives that would benefit the descendants of slaves, while Episcopal dioceses in New York and Long Island made million- and half-million-dollar commitments as reparations committees continued their work.

In May, the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland voted to study reparations and urge congregations to “examine how their endowed wealth is tied to the institution of slavery.

”Maryland’s African American bishop, Eugene Taylor Sutton, said tears came to his eyes when the measure passed at the diocese’s general convention with no dissenting votes, and he realized that the assembled delegates, representing a membership that is 90% white, “got it.”

“They get this thing called justice, and when you put it in a frame that there is a basic injustice in this nation of stealing from generations of people and that has a direct effect on today, then people,” Sutton said, “they say, 'OK, we got to get that fixed.’

”Sutton, who testified before Congress in June with writer Ta-Nehisi Coates to advocate for the idea of a U.S. reparations commission, emphasized that reparations can come in many forms. Starting next month, members of his diocese will begin to consider options such as providing better access for people of color to home buying, job training and faculty positions at seminaries.

It has taken some American religious institutions 50 years to get their heads around reparations. When Forman hijacked that Sunday morning service, two-thirds of Riverside worshippers, including the minister, stormed out in protest. After activists occupied offices in the Interchurch Center of New York, a court issued restraining orders to bar Forman from the building. In Missouri, manifesto supporters in St. Louis carried out a series of “Black Sunday” protests, interrupting local services, which led to confrontations with white church members and arrests.

The manifesto was quite specific in its demands. Black activists would control the distribution of reparations. The $500 million (soon increased to $3 billion) would be spent on programs designed to ensure black self-determination. These included establishing a Southern land bank, publishing industries, television networks, job training centers, labor unions and a black university.

The manifesto’s rhetoric was just as controversial. Written by Forman, a former member of the civil rights group known as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the preamble framed reparations in Marxist terms. “Time is short,” Forman wrote. “(N)o oppressed people ever gained their liberation until they were ready to fight, to use whatever means necessary, including the use of force and power of the gun to bring down the colonizer.

”Prominent black and white religious leaders diverged on how to interpret Forman’s call for revolution. The Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy, who succeeded the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, compared Forman to biblical prophets who spoke truth to power. Writing in The Christian Century, he asked, “Was there not even a physical resemblance between Amos, the dusty-road-weary prophet in his desert garb, and Jim Forman in his dashiki?”

The response from some white denominations was outright rejection. The Southern Baptist Convention dismissed the manifesto as “outrageous.” The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York called it un-American and touted its own programs for the “needy and disadvantaged” instead.

The American Jewish Committee, which as part of the Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization had helped organize the National Black Economic Development Conference, withdrew from the IFCO. Rabbi Marc H. Tanenbaum, IFCO’s first president, resigned, stating hecould not “in conscience stand by in silence and appear ... to give assent to the revolutionary ideology and racist rhetoric of the Black Manifesto.

”Other denominations were more ambivalent. The Reformed Church in America invited Forman to address its general synod after he occupied the denomination’s headquarters a month after his action at Riverside. The Rev. Rand Peabody, a 22-year-old white seminarian who had already been slated to give the sermon the next day, revised his sermon after hearing news of Forman’s “liberation” of the RCA’s offices.

“I remember I said it’s not a time for us to feel either blamed or shamed and certainly not a time to feel futile,” Peabody, now 73, said in an interview. “Our denomination, in his eye, did indeed have the power to play a part and we should accept that as almost a commissioning of the denomination to indeed step up to the plate and get involved in more focused and proactive ways.

”Like other denominations, the RCA didn’t accede to Forman’s demand that reparations be handed over freely. Instead the synod voted to create a $100,000 fund “to be disbursed according to the decisions” of a newly formed Black Council. The council then rejected the money.“We just basically wanted to be at the table where decisions are being made and not considered an auxiliary or an offshoot or a secondhand portion of the denomination,” said the Rev. Dwayne Jackson, a Hackensack, New Jersey, pastor, who was a panelist at an RCA event commemorating the manifesto in October titled “Unfinished Business.”

Jackson, who knew some members of the council from his childhood church in the Bronx, said the staffer hired to oversee the council was the church’s first black executive. (Today, people of color comprise a third of the RCA’s executive leadership team.)

Other denominations acknowledged the grievances raised by the manifesto but rejected the solutions it proposed and even the language of “reparations.” Instead they created or continued programs aimed at helping poor blacks and others. The Presbyterian Committee on the Self-Development of People, the Evangelical Covenant Church’s Fund for Disadvantaged Americans of Minority Groups and the Episcopal Church’s General Convention Special Program were all created around the time of Forman’s action.

Dominique DuBois Gilliard, the current director of the ECC’s “racial righteousness and reconciliation” ministry, recently reflected on how this kind of response “enacted a very problematic erasure of the black freedom struggle.”

Met with the manifesto’s demands, “the Covenant found it more palatable to shift the conversation to marginalization in general,” Gilliard writes in the May/August edition of its Covenant Quarterly, which focused on the 50th anniversary of the manifesto. “This response has strong parallels to proclamations that ‘All Lives Matter’ in response to the declaration ‘Black Lives Matter.’""

There has been a shift in recent years, however, which Gilliard has helped encourage. The ECC Resolution on Racism, passed in June, insists that “the time is right for white clergy to attend to the sins of our own community and make a public commitment to prioritize antiracism work within our ministerium.”

Nell Gibson, a member and former chair of the Episcopal Diocese of New York’s Reparations Committee, recalled that in the wake of Forman’s declaration — which resulted in the Episcopal Church’s $200,000 donation to the National Committee of Black Churchmen — members of her Manhattan church created a Black and Brown Caucus. After receiving the $30,000 they demanded from their St. Mark’s Church-in-the-Bowery, they developed a free breakfast program for children, a summer “liberation school” that taught minority children their ancestors’ history and a prison law library.

Fifty years on, reparations are often framed as spiritual tests as much as financial ones. This year was named the “Year of Apology” for the Episcopal Diocese of New York, and each Sunday Gibson’s congregation has said a prayer that includes this sentence: “For the many ways — social, economic and political — that white supremacy has accrued benefits to some of us at the expense of others, we repent.”

Soon, the diocesan reparations committee will consider a number of possible next steps, such as a truth and reconciliation commission or education and health care initiatives.

Likewise, Sutton said his Maryland Episcopal diocese is moving methodically after years of conversation about reparations to figuring out how that will be lived out financially and otherwise.

“We don’t have all the solutions, we don’t know everything that’s going to fix the problem and so we’re going to be humble in even what we think we can accomplish,” he said. “But, by God, we’re going to do something.

That’s why many environmentalists are fighting cell tower installation at national parks (see 1, 2). Unfortunately, businesses still want to install WiFi in national parks anyway. Yellowstone Park is asking for public comments about this. The deadline is November 29.

MAMMOTH HOT SPRINGS, Wyoming — The National Park Service seeks public comment on a proposal to install indoor Wi-Fi networks and associated equipment throughout Yellowstone National Park’s developed areas for the benefit of park visitors and employees.

AccessParks has submitted an application for a right-of-way permit. If approved, the permit would allow for:
• The installation of up to 484 small (10 x 10 inch or 7 inch diameter) antennas on employee housing and visitor lodging facilities at Canyon Village, Grant Village, Lake Village, Mammoth Hot Springs, and Old Faithful.
• To link the antennas to internet providers outside the park, 39 additional antennas would be required and would include:

 – 29 x 9 inch antennas installed at various locations in the developed areas at Canyon Village, Grant Village, Lake Village, Mammoth Hot Springs, and Old Faithful

 – 6-foot-diameter antenna installed at an existing tower at Old Faithful

 – One 2-foot and one 3-foot-diameter antenna installed on the existing tower at Mount Washburn
• Coverage could eventually extend to other developed areas such as Norris, Madison, and Bechler for administrative and employee use.
• Exterior antennas would be located in areas to minimize visibility. Where visible, the installations would be painted to match the buildings on which they are installed.
• In an effort to have no adverse effect to historic properties or districts, many of the antennas on National Register of Historic Places eligible structures would be located in attic spaces or under eaves.
• Examples of typical antenna placements and a list of affected properties are available here: https://parkplanning.nps.gov/ap

The proposed installations would provide internet service to park visitors and employees in hotels and housing in developed areas. Consistent with the Yellowstone National Park Wireless Communication Services Plan, wireless access to recommended wilderness and park road corridors would be excluded.

564992,tass,"It turns out that planetary masses less than 7-10 Earth masses are
characterized by atmospheric gas losses.

An international group of researchers studying a planet revolving around a
young star in the constellation of Scorpius has created a mathematical upper
atmosphere model for various planetary hypothetical masses. Examining this
planet makes it possible to study planetary evolution at early stages,
Siberian Federal University’s (SFU) press service told TASS on Monday.

“In the spectral type M K2-33 star’s planetary system, the transit photometry
method led to discovery of a very large planet, whose radius equals 5 radiuses
of Earth. The system is extremely young (younger than 20 million years) which
provides the researchers with an extraordinary opportunity to study the
earliest phases of planetary evolution at a stage when planets are affected by
the extremely intensive rays of a young star,” the press service stressed.

The scientists managed to calculate the lowest estimated mass of the planet,
which is 10 Earth masses.

“This study featured numerical models of the planetary upper atmosphere for
various hypothetical planetary masses, which varied from 2 to 40 Earth masses
and different planetary temperatures from 850 to 1,300 Kelvins dependent on
the internal heating  created by gravitational contraction,” the press service
quotes Nikolay Yerkayev, an SFU applied mathematics department professor as
saying.

The researchers found out that planetary masses less than 7-10 Earth masses
experience fast losses of atmospheric gas, leaking out into space because the
temperature is too high and the fact that the planet’s mass is insufficient to
retain atmosphere. For larger masses, the intensity of these atmospheric leaks
depends on the absorption of the high-energy rays produced by the star. “By
cross-referencing the time it takes for the atmosphere to fully leak into
space and the age of the system, we came up with the lowest estimation for the
planet’s mass, which is around 10 Earth masses,” Yerkayev said.

Apart from the SFU scientists, experts from the Graz Space Research Institute
(Austria), the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (Germany), Vienna University
(Austria) and Institute of Computational Modeling SB RAS (Russia) also took
part in the research. The results of which were published in the Astronomy and
Astrophysics scientific journal.

Sen. Peter Wirth (D) filed Senate Bill 199 (SB199) on Jan. 8. Titled the “Electronic Communications Privacy Act,” the new law will help block the use of cell site simulators, known as “stingrays.” These devices essentially spoof cell phone towers, tricking any device within range into connecting to the stingray instead of the tower, allowing law enforcement to sweep up communications content, as well as locate and track the person in possession of a specific phone or other electronic device.

The bill requires police to obtain a warrant or wiretap order before deploying a stingray device, unless they have the explicit permission of the owner or authorized possessor of the device, or if the device is lost or stolen. SB199 includes an exception to the warrant requirement for emergency situations. Even then, police must apply for a warrant within 3 days and destroy any information obtained if the court denies the application.

On Jan. 24, the Senate passed SB199 by a 41-0 vote. On Jan. 30, the House concurred with a vote of 68-0. With the governor’s signature, the law will go into effect 90 days after adjournment of the legislature.

SB199 also bars law enforcement agencies from compelling a service provider or any person other than the owner of the device without a warrant or wiretap order. This includes actual communication content such as phone conversations, text messages and email, location information and other metadata such as IP addresses pertaining to a person or device participating in the communication.

A service provider may still share information voluntarily under the law. Law enforcement will have to destroy such information within 90 days unless it gets the consent of the owner or a court order.

Provisions in SB199 will severely limit sharing of any legally obtained data.

The legislation provides a legal remedy for anybody whose data is obtained in violation of the law.

A similar bill unanimously passed in both houses of the New Mexico legislature in 2017, but Gov. Susana Martinez vetoed the bill, saying she didn’t want to “burden law enforcement officials.” Martinez was term-limited out of office and Democrat Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham replaced her in 2019.

The federal government funds the vast majority of state and local stingray programs, attaching one important condition. The feds require agencies acquiring the technology to sign non-disclosure agreements. This throws a giant shroud over the program, even preventing judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys from getting information about the use of stingrays in court. The feds actually instruct prosecutors to withdraw evidence if judges or legislators press for information. As the Baltimore Sun reported in April 2015, a Baltimore detective refused to answer questions on the stand during a trial, citing a federal non-disclosure agreement.

“Does this document instruct you to withhold evidence from the state’s attorney and Circuit Court, even upon court order to produce?” he asked.

As privacysos.org put it, “The FBI would rather police officers and prosecutors let ‘criminals’ go than face a possible scenario where a defendant brings a Fourth Amendment challenge to warrantless stingray spying.”

The experience of a Pinellas County, Florida, man further highlights the shroud of secrecy around the use of stingray devices, along with the potential for abuse of power inherent in America’s law enforcement community.

The feds sell the technology in the name of “anti-terrorism” efforts. With non-disclosure agreements in place, most police departments refuse to release any information on the use of stingrays. But information obtained from the Tacoma Police Department revealed that it uses the technology primarily for routine criminal investigations.

Some privacy advocates argue that stingray use can never happen within the parameters of the Fourth Amendment because the technology necessarily connects to every electronic device within range, not just the one held by the target. And the information collected by these devices undoubtedly ends up in federal databases.

The feds can share and tap into vast amounts of information gathered at the state and local level through fusion centers and a system known as the “information sharing environment” or ISE. In other words, stingrays create the potential for the federal government to track the movement of millions of Americans with no warrant, no probable cause, and without the people even knowing it.

Fusion centers were sold as a tool to combat terrorism, but that is not how they are being used. The ACLU pointed to a bipartisan congressional report to demonstrate the true nature of government fusion centers: “They haven’t contributed anything meaningful to counterterrorism efforts. Instead, they have largely served as police surveillance and information sharing nodes for law enforcement efforts targeting the frequent subjects of police attention: Black and brown people, immigrants, dissidents, and the poor.”

Fusion centers operate within the broader ISE. According to its website, the ISE “provides analysts, operators, and investigators with information needed to enhance national security. These analysts, operators, and investigators…have mission needs to collaborate and share information with each other and with private sector partners and our foreign allies.” In other words, ISE serves as a conduit for the sharing of information gathered without a warrant. Known ISE partners include the Office of Director of National Intelligence which oversees 17 federal agencies and organizations, including the NSA. ISE utilizes these partnerships to collect and share data on the millions of unwitting people they track. The federal government encourages and funds stingrays at the state and local level across the U.S., thereby undoubtedly gaining access to a massive data pool on Americans without having to expend the resources to collect the information itself. By placing restrictions on stingray use, state and local governments limit the data available that the feds can access. In a nutshell, without state and local cooperation, the feds have a much more difficult time gathering information. Passage of SB199 strikes a major blow to the surveillance state and is a win for privacy. By allowing defendants to suppress information obtained in violation of the law, SB199 will hinder one practical effect of NSA spying in New Mexico. Reuters revealed the extent of such NSA data sharing with state and local law enforcement in an August 2013 article. According to documents obtained by the news agency, the NSA passes information to police through a formerly secret DEA unit known Special Operations Divisions and the cases “rarely involve national security issues.” Almost all of the information involves regular criminal investigations, not terror-related investigations. In other words, not only does the NSA collect and store this data, using it to build profiles, the agency encourages state and local law enforcement to violate the Fourth Amendment by making use of this information in their day-to-day investigations. This is “the most threatening situation to our constitutional republic since the Civil War,” Binney said.

112087,cnsnews,"(CNSNews.com) – Sri Lanka police declared an overnight curfew after Easter Sunday’s deadly bombing spree targeting churches and five-star hotels. The country’s prime minister confirmed that authorities had received prior warning about the possibility of a terrorist attack.

Police say at least 290 people were killed in the coordinated blasts, some of which were carried out by suicide bombers. Most victims were Sri Lankans but several dozen foreigners also died.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed that “several U.S. citizens” are among the dead. Other nations whose nationals were killed, according to their governments, include Britain, Portugal, Turkey, the Netherlands, and China.

“These vile attacks are a stark reminder of why the United States remains resolved in our fight to defeat terrorism,” Pompeo said in a statement.

“We stand with the Sri Lankan government and people as they confront violent extremism and have offered our assistance as they work to bring the perpetrators to justice.”

More than 500 people were injured in the eight explosions, most of which occurred in Colombo, the capital and largest city of the Indian Ocean island nation.

A possible ninth blast was averted when a pipe bomb hidden in a bag near the main international airport was found and destroyed by air force personnel.

According to South Asia terrorism monitors, this was the first terrorist attack in Sri Lanka since the country emerged from a long and deadly civil war in 2009 between the majority ethnic Sinhalese Buddhist majority and the predominantly Hindu Tamil ethnic minority.

State minister of defense Ruwan Wijewardene described the perpetrators as religious extremists – without identifying the religion – and said most of the explosions were caused by suicide bombers.

“We shall not give any chance for these extremist groups to operate,” he told reporters. “We will go after them, whatever religious extremism that they are following,” he added, saying the perpetrators had been identified and would be apprehended shortly. By early Monday the number of suspects in custody had reached 24, police confirmed.

Christians and tourists were the intended victims of the terrorists, who struck on the most significant day of the Christian calendar.

The first bombs exploded in three churches, two Roman Catholic and one Protestant, during Easter morning services. They are the St. Anthony’s Shrine in Colombo, St. Sebastian’s Church in Negombo, a prominent Catholic town north of the capital, and Zion Church, an evangelical denomination in Batticaloa on Sri Lanka’s east coast.

The two Catholic churches accounted for the greatest loss of life of all of the buildings hit.

Also targeted were four hotels in Colombo – the Cinnamon Grand, the Shangri-La, the Kingsbury, and the Tropical Inn. Hours after the initial blasts there was another explosion at a housing complex in a Colombo neighborhood, which was reportedly detonated by a suicide bomber as police closed in on suspects. Seven suspects were arrested at that property.

Sri Lanka Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in a later statement confirmed that “three brave police officers … sacrificed their lives in the process of apprehending some of the suspects.”

Wickremesinghe said authorities had received prior information on the possibility of an attack but that neither he nor the cabinet had been “adequately informed.”

“A serious issue is that though information been received earlier not enough attention had been paid,” the national business news service Economy Next quoted him as saying. “We have to look deeper into this.”

Sri Lanka has a population of 22.5 million and is a little larger in size than West Virginia.

According to U.S. government data, only around seven percent of the population is Christian, mostly Catholic. Buddhists account for the majority of Sri Lankans (about 70 percent), while 12 percent are Hindus, and just under ten percent are Muslims, mostly Sunnis.

Until the conflict ended in 2009, well over 60,000 people were killed in a 26-year civil war between the majority government and the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization fighting for a separate state in the north and east of the island.

The LTTE became infamous for suicide bombings – including the use of suicide belts and ramming attacks using explosive-laden small boats – well before the tactic became more widely known as a result of the actions of al-Qaeda and other radical Sunni Islamic groups.

Last January, Sri Lankan police investigating the vandalizing of Buddhist statues arrested four men attached to a “newly-formed radical Muslim group,” Economy Next reported at the time. The arrests led to the discovery of 220 pounds of high explosive and a large number of detonators hidden in the country’s north-west.

Whoever the perpetrators turn out to be, ISIS sympathizers on social media celebrated news of the carnage, characterizing the bombings as vengeance for attacks on Muslims.

In his televised statement, Wickremesinghe pledged to “ensure that terrorism does not lift its head in Sri Lanka. We cannot allow that and we are prepared to take all measures necessary to ensure that terrorism is contained and wiped out in this country.”

He described the suspects as Sri Lankan, but also said the authorities would need the help of other governments in the region to examine the possible “overseas links of this terrorist group.”

Wickremesinghe also urged people to support the security services and “ensure there is no miscommunication which leads to other incidents” and diverts the security forces’ attention away from the investigation.

Sri Lanka has a poor record of religious tolerance. The State Department’s most recent report on international religious freedom, covering 2017, cites 97 documented attacks or incidents of intimidation targeting Christians in 2017, and reports of dozens of attacks on mosques and Muslim prayer rooms.",Sri Lanka Easter Bombings Aimed at Christians: Terrorists Described as Religious Extremists,"conflict, war and peace",act of terror,918
700193,theguardianuk,"The Vatican has launched its first women’s football team, with a debut challenge against AS Roma’s Serie A women’s squad on 26 May.

More than half of the team is made up of staff working within the Vatican, as well as employees’ wives and daughters.

“Pope Francis has given considerable impulse to women within the Vatican, therefore this initiative is an extension of that,” Danilo Zennaro, a representative of Sport in Vaticano, an association that organises the Vatican’s football activities, told the Guardian.

“We’ve had a men’s team for 48 years so it was only right to offer the possibility to women who work within the Vatican to practise the sport.”

Most of the players are at amateur level, although three have played football at a high level in the past, including the captain and striker Eugene Tcheugoue, from Cameroon. The team is being managed by Susan Volpini, the secretary of the Women in the Vatican Association.

The players are training for their friendly against AS Roma, which will be followed by an international match in Vienna in June, by taking part in a tournament organised by the Vatican’s children’s hospital, Bambino Gesù.

“This will allow them to reach their best fitness and practise tactical solutions,” Volpini said.

The game against AS Roma, who came fourth in its first season in the Serie A women’s league, will be tough, but Zennaro said it was not just about winning.

“Even if they lose 30-0, this doesn’t matter,” he said. “What matters is that these women get the opportunity to know professional players. Win or lose, it’s also about creating connections and friendships.”

The Vatican launched an athletics team in January, with the aim of competing in international competitions, including the Olympics.

“The fundamental patterning that is found throughout the cosmos is the master key to creating living systems that are healthy, sustainable & thriving” says Lefferts.  The wisdom of this…. “higher-order wholeness & design integrity of nature is vastly greater in its importance & relevance to human evolution……essential to establishing coherence & balance during this period of rapid & radical transition on Earth.”

Here the photo of the Vector Equilibrium, compliments of http://www.cosmometry.net, “the geometry of absolute equilibrium; all fluctuation ceases; we call zero-point or Unified Field… where lies pure infinite & creative potential!  “In order for anything to manifest in the universe, physically (energy) & metaphysically (consciousness), it requires a fluctuation in the Unified Field …resulting in… the Quantum & Spacetime Fields.”  In other words, mass & geometries form that we can observe & measure.  That’s the bare minimum beginning for you.

The TORUS photo featured at the top of this blog may be familiar.  It is “the ultimate, most balanced flow process found in sustainable systems at all scales”: atomic to galactic.  It “enables a seamless fractal embedding of energy flow wherein each entity has its unique identity while being connected to all else.”

How fascinating that the universal TORUS applies to humans, plants, trees, hurricanes, each of us surrounded by this field flowing in the top, out the bottom, & back up around to the top again.  These toroidal fields connect with each other:  our “Earth’s magnetic field is embedded inside the Sun’s field; & both are embedded inside our Galaxy Torus.  And it goes inward into the ecosystems & organs of our bodies, the cells they’re made of & the molecules, atoms & sub-atomic particles they’re made of……”

Now is it making some sense that we are all inter-connected unique entities, but part of a Whole Universe?!  This is why it is critical to understand the inter-connections on our Planet in order to rebuild every system, economic, social, financial, & reconnect with Nature to correct our imbalanced TORUS to return to a sustainable, thriving ecosystem.  “We can see that there is a seamlessly dynamic exchange of energy & information (consciousness) occurring throughout the entire cosmic experience.   And yet there is only one whole energy flow occurring throughout the entirety of it!” (what physicist David Bohm calls the Holomovement).

Lefferts, an accomplished Musician, is well aware of the physics, science & spirituality fields.  He is President, Bd. of Dir. @ Physicist Nassim Haramein’s The Resonance Project Foundation;  Assoc. Producer of Foster & Kimberly Gamble’s new THRIVE film, What on Earth will it Take? (due 2020); co-Founder of Gene Keys, & Superluminal Systems; Co-Director of Barbara Marx Hubbard’s Foundation for Conscious Evolution, & Consulting Producer of The Buckminster Fuller Institute.

There you have the bare minimum understanding of the Universe & our Planet reality.  It is crucial wisdom to apply this vibrant & sustainable system to repair Earth now; and, to build the Paradise we want for our near future.  “Cosmometry” is a fascinating read that will prepare & empower all of us to be a part of the balanced toroidal system of the Universe.

23191,bbc,"The New York City Commission on Human Rights has released guidelines against targeting people on the basis of their hairstyle, classing this as racist discrimination.

The guidelines aim to protect the rights of New Yorkers in schools, work places and public places, where black people are disproportionately affected by policies banning hairstyles such as afros, cornrows and locs.

A report from the commission said black hairstyles are often deemed ""unprofessional"" and by limiting how workers and students wear their hair, organisations ""perpetuate racist stereotypes"".

NYC Human Rights Commissioner Chair Carmelyn P Malalis said hairstyle policies were not about professionalism but rather a way of ""limiting the way black people move through workplaces, public spaces and other settings"".

She said the guidelines will help organisations ""understand that black New Yorkers have the right to wear their hair however they choose without fear of stigma or retaliation"".

Brittny Saunders and Demoya Gordon were both part of the team at the commission writing the guidelines and could offer personal experiences of hair discrimination.

""When I started work, I chemically straightened my hair because I understood that the expectation would be that I would present myself with straight hair,"" said Ms Saunders. ""It would be against expectations to have natural hair.""

""You police yourself accordingly,"" agreed Ms Gordon.

""When I started going to interviews at law firms I knew that there would already be a lot of scepticism about my place as a black woman in that space and that wearing my locs down would not be considered 'professional'.

""It was almost 6 years into my career that I stopped pinning my locs up and started wearing them down most of the time.

""It was only when I moved from working in a law firm to a non-profit organisation that I felt able to do this and even then I would still wear it up when I had to go to court or take a deposition.""

Businesses found to have flouted the guidelines could face fines of up to $250,000 (£191,000).

But this is not a problem specific to New York.

One woman from London, who preferred not to be named, said she was once sent home from working in a clothes shop because she wore her hair in braids. She was 18 at the time.

""They said: 'Go home, take those braids out of your hair- this is not our look.' But the hairstyle they did want was a straight hair weave, which is not natural. They wanted me to adhere to European standards of beauty,"" she said.

Now aged 26, she said that at the time she did not question her managers because she did not feel she could. ""I wish someone would,"" she added.

Now working in a more relaxed workplace, she wears her hair in an afro, but has black female friends who wear a ""work wig"" in an attempt to ""fit in, to cause less tension for themselves"".

A 23-year-old from the UK said her school which was majority white, banned ""extreme"" hairstyles.

""I wasn't sure what that meant, but it meant cornrows. They said they were gang affiliated,"" she said. Afros were also banned, described as ""distracting"".

""I relaxed my hair when I was 13 because when it was straight they didn't mind,"" she added.

Commissioner Malalis emphasised the importance of the guidelines in schools. ""It's so important for young people to themselves and to be valued for who they are,"" she said.",New York City bans hair discrimination to fight racism,society,discrimination,555

25190,bbc,"A technology that removes carbon dioxide from the air has received significant backing from major fossil fuel companies.

British Columbia-based Carbon Engineering has shown that it can extract CO2 in a cost-effective way.

It has now been boosted by $68m in new investment from Chevron, Occidental and coal giant BHP.

But climate campaigners are worried that the technology will be used to extract even more oil.

The quest for technology for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the air received significant scientific endorsement last year with the publication of the IPCC report on keeping the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C this century.

In their ""summary for policymakers"", the scientists stated that: ""All pathways that limit global warming to 1.5C with limited or no overshoot project the use of CDR ...over the 21st century.""

Around the world, a number of companies are racing to develop the technology that can draw down carbon. Swiss company Climeworks is already capturing CO2 and using it to boost vegetable production.

Carbon Engineering says that its direct air capture (DAC) process is now able to capture the gas for under $100 a tonne.

With its new funding, the company plans to build its first commercial facilities. These industrial-scale DAC plants could capture up to one million tonnes of CO2 from the air each year.

CO2 is a powerful warming gas but there's not a lot of it in the atmosphere - for every million molecules of air, there are 410 of CO2.

While the CO2 is helping to drive temperatures up around the world, the comparatively low concentrations make it difficult to design efficient machines to remove the gas.

Carbon Engineering's process is all about sucking in air and exposing it to a chemical solution that concentrates the CO2. Further refinements mean the gas can be purified into a form that can be stored or utilised as a liquid fuel.

Carbon Engineering's barn-sized installation has a large fan in the middle of the roof which draws in air from the atmosphere.

It then comes into contact with a hydroxide-based chemical solution. Certain hydroxides react with carbon dioxide, reversibly binding to the CO2 molecule. When the CO2 in the air reacts with the liquid, it forms a carbonate mixture. That is then treated with a slurry of calcium hydroxide to change it into solid form; the slurry helps form tiny pellets of calcium carbonate.

The chalky calcium carbonate pellets are then treated at a high temperature of about 900C, with the pellets decomposing into a CO2 stream and calcium oxide.

That stream of pure CO2 is cleaned up to remove water impurities.

""The key to this process is about concentrating the CO2,"" said Carbon Engineering's Dr Jenny McCahill.

""We can then put it underground as in sequestration, or we can combine it with hydrogen to form hydrocarbons or methanol. There's a number of things you can do.""

Yes. It's complicated but it can be done.

The captured CO2 is mixed with hydrogen that's made from water and green electricity. It's then passed over a catalyst at 900C to form carbon monoxide. Adding in more hydrogen to the carbon monoxide turns it into what's called synthesis gas.

Finally a Fischer-Tropsch process turns this gas into a synthetic crude oil. Carbon Engineering says the liquid can be used in a variety of engines without modification.

""The fuel that we make has no sulphur in it, it has these nice linear chains which means it burns cleaner than traditional fuel,"" said Dr McCahill.

""It's nice and clear and ready to be used in a truck, car or jet.""

CO2 can also be used to flush out the last remaining deposits of oil in wells that are past their prime. The oil industry in the US has been using the gas in this way for decades.

It's estimated that using CO2 can deliver an extra 30% of crude from oilfields with the added benefit that the gas is then sequestered permanently in the ground.

""Carbon Engineering's direct air capture technology has the unique capability to capture and provide large volumes of atmospheric CO2,"" said Occidental Petroleum's Senior Vice President, Richard Jackson, in a statement.

""This capability complements Occidental's enhanced oil recovery business and provides further synergies by enabling large-scale CO2 utilisation and sequestration.""

One of the other investors in Carbon Engineering is BHP, best known for its coal mining interests.

""The reality is that fossil fuels will be around for several decades whether in industrial processes or in transportation,"" said Dr Fiona Wild, BHP's head of sustainability and climate change.

""What we need to do is invest in those low-emission technologies that can significantly reduce the emissions from these processes, and that's why we are focusing on carbon capture and storage.""

Some climate campaigners are positive about the development of direct air capture technology, but others are worried that it will be used to prolong the fossil fuel era.

""We need to be working together to figure out how we move away completely from fossil fuel - that's our moral and economic challenge but these technologies provide a false hope that we can continue to depend on fossil fuels and produce and burn them, and technology will fix it - we are way past that point!""

Others are concerned that the development of direct air capture devices may just encourage some people to think that they don't have to personally reduce their carbon footprint.

""I think there's a real danger that people will see this technology as a magic bullet and not cut back their carbon,"" said Shakti Ramkumar, a student at the University of British Columbia (UBC), who is active in climate change protests.

""We have a moral responsibility to reduce our consumption on a large scale. We need to reflect deeply on how we live our lives and whether everyone can have access to the things we have, and fairness, so we can all live a good life.""

It's impossible to say if Carbon Engineering's idea will emerge as the type of device that makes a major difference in the battle against climate change.

Certainly, the company believes that its machines could become as common as water treatment plants - providing a valuable service, yet hardly noticed by the general public.

Right now, it has secured enough money to build a commercial facility and can draw down carbon for less than $100 a tonne. But there is a big worry that with large investments from the fossil fuel industry, the focus of its efforts could be turned to producing more oil, not just tackling climate change.

Carbon Engineering says that if governments want to invest in its process they are very welcome to do so. If they're not ready to stump up the cash, the company is happy to take funding from the energy industry as time is so short, and the need for the technology is so great.

""Is it the silver bullet?"" asked CEO Steve Oldham.

""I would never say to anybody that you want to put all your eggs in one basket - the future of the planet is very important for us all.

""But having the technology built, available, ready to go, with no harmful chemical side-effects, less land-usage, having those available - that's a good thing.

""If or when we need them, and if you read the science that's today - it's available, it's ready.""

753958,theindependent,"A procedure which helps obese people to lose weight by reducing blood flow to the stomach could become a cheaper and less risky alternative to other surgeries, a clinical trial suggests.

Researchers leading tests of the recently developed technique, known as bariatric embolisation, showed that over a year severely obese patients shed around 10 per cent of their body weight.

They also reported having a reduced appetite, feeling full more quickly, and showed promising early signs that their cholesterol was going down.

“This is a great step forward for this procedure establishing early feasibility, safety and early efficacy,” said Dr Clifford Weiss, lead author of the study from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

The pioneering procedure works by using a tubular catheter to access the blood vessels and place microscopic beads which block off some of the arteries leading to the stomach.

This reduces the blood flow enough to prevent the stomach releasing hunger-triggering hormones, but not enough to cause damage.

Obesity is a growing public health crisis in developed countries like the US and UK. Britain is already the fattest nation in western Europe and this is driving rates of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancers.

This places a significant burden on health systems, and while weight-loss surgeries are shown to be effective in reducing obesity, financial constraints mean the NHS has been reduced to rationing these as well.

Embolisation is already used to shut off blood flow to a weak or damaged blood vessel – aneurysm repair – and a way to starve cancerous tumours of oxygen.

While it is still in early stages in weight loss, bariatric embolisation instead of gastric bypass, where the small intestine is attached to a pouch at the top of the stomach, or gastric bands which pinch the stomach to make a person feel full quicker, with less risk of infection and complications.

The 20 patients in the trial, which is published in the journal Radiology on Tuesday, lost 8.2 per cent of their excess weight in the first three months and had lost 11.5 per cent of their weight by the end of the trial.

Crucially the participants all reported that their quality of life had improved as well.

Larger trials with more patients will be needed to rule out the possibility that the weight loss is just a temporary placebo effect, but it looks at present like a future option to help combat obesity.

“It is fulfilling to all of us to see something that started as an idea develop through about a decade of research and then go all the way to an initial clinical trial,” Dr Weiss said.

“The reality is that obesity itself is an individualised disease that requires individualised treatments.”

55743,birminghammail,"An 11-year-old boy has become the first NHS patient to receive a pioneering new cancer therapy that uses the body's own immune system to fight the disease.

Yuvan Thakkar, from Watford, received the drug Kymriah, a type of immunotherapy called CAR-T cell therapy, at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) in London last week.

Yuvan has acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), which can be cured in around 90% of children who undergo conventional chemotherapy.

However, Yuvan's cancer has failed to respond to two rounds of chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant, meaning he has few options left.

Now, experts at GOSH have given him Kymriah (also known as (tisagenlecleucel), which was approved for use on the NHS after a deal was struck between NHS England and the drugs firm Novartis to offer it at a reduced price.

Previously, CAR-T cell therapy was only available to patients as part of research trials.

The treatment involves taking the patient's own T cells (a type of immune cell) from their blood and genetically engineering them in the laboratory so they recognise and fight cancer cells.

Millions of these genetically engineered CAR-T cells are grown in the laboratory and then given back to the patient via an infusion into their bloodstream.

Each dose of Kymriah is a customised treatment created using these own T-cells.

In Yuvan's case, his T cells were first extracted in November last year, and shipped to laboratories in Rotterdam and Texas, where they underwent the complex editing procedure.

Research has shown that CAR-T can lead to a cure or extended survival for a high number of patients, although not everyone benefits.

In clinical trials in the US, around 50% to 62% of patients survive without leukaemia for 12 months or more.

Yuvan, a keen cricket fan, was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2014.

Despite treatment and a bone marrow transplant last year, he was still found to still have leukaemia.

Yuvan's parents, his mother Sapna, and father Vinay, said in a statement: ""When Yuvan was diagnosed it was the most heartbreaking news we had ever received.

""We tried to stay hopeful as they say leukaemia in children has 90% cure rate, but sadly, his illness relapsed.

""This new therapy is our last hope. It means a rebirth to us if this treatment works and we hope it really does.

""We are so glad that we at least have this new option now.

""If he had relapsed a year ago it would have been a different story.""

Yuvan said, ""I really hope I get better soon so I can visit Lego House in Denmark. I love Lego and am building a big model Bugatti while I'm in hospital.""

Professor Charles Swanton, Cancer Research UK's chief clinician, said: ""It's fantastic news that children and young people like Yuvan can receive CAR-T cell therapy on the NHS, giving another option when their cancer returns.

""This is an incredibly complex treatment to give, Yuvan's cells were processed in both Europe and the US, and needed collaboration across borders to get the T-cell infusion back to London so he could be treated.

""The UK was one of the first countries in the world to approve CAR-T cell therapy, showing that the NHS remains at the forefront of innovation when it comes to new cancer treatments.

""More research is underway so that we can identify who's most likely to benefit from CAR-T cell therapy, as well as how to further refine the technique, so as many as possible can benefit.""

Side-effects from CAR-T can occur and patients need to be kept in isolation following treatment.

CAR-T can cost around £280,000 per patient, although NHS England has brought down this price during negotiations.

As well as GOSH, the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital and Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust will offer the treatment to young people with leukaemia.

Another type of CAR-T cell therapy, called Yescarta, has been approved on the NHS for adults with aggressive types of lymphoma.

Dr Sara Ghorashian, consultant in paediatric haematology at GOSH and Yuvan's doctor, said: ""We are so pleased to be able to offer patients like Yuvan another chance to be cured.

""While it will be a while before the outcome of this powerful new therapy is known, the treatment has shown very promising results in clinical trials and we are hopeful that it will help.""",Boy becomes first NHS patient to receive revolutionary new cancer drug,health,diseases and conditions,693
22186,bbc,"A peace deal between the government of the Central African Republic (CAR) and 14 rebel groups has been struck after talks in Sudan, officials say.

The deal was announced by the UN mission in CAR, known as Minusca, and the African Union (AU), which both sponsored the talks in Khartoum.

""This is a great day for Central African Republic and all its people,"" said AU commissioner Smail Chergui.

The government said the peace deal would be signed in Bangui soon.

Details of the agreement have not been released and analysts caution that previous peace deals have all collapsed.

CAR, which has been unstable since gaining independence from France in 1960, was plunged into turmoil in 2013 when Muslim rebels from the Seleka umbrella group seized power in the majority-Christian country.

A band of mostly Christian militias, called the anti-Balaka, rose up to counter the Seleka.

Thousands have been killed in the violence and more than one million internally displaced. An estimated 570,000 people have fled abroad.

""We have finalised a peace agreement in Khartoum, enabling the people of Central African Republic to embark on a path of reconciliation, agreement and development,"" Mr Chergui tweeted on Saturday.

The government of President Faustin-Archange Touadera also confirmed the agreement on Twitter.

""This agreement should be initialled tomorrow (Sunday) and its signing will take place in Bangui in a few days,"" the tweet added.

A spokesman for the FPRC armed faction said consensus had been reached on sticking points which included an amnesty for militia fighters and an inclusive government.

""We were able to agree on what is essential for the Central African Republic - peace. We hope this agreement will bring back social cohesion to the country,"" Abakar Sabom said.",Central African Republic agrees peace deal with rebel groups,"conflict, war and peace",peace process,275
201093,fortune,"Filings for U.S. unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell to a five-week low, even amid a partial federal government shutdown.

Jobless claims declined by 3,000 to 213,000 in the week ended Jan. 12, below economist forecasts, Labor Department figures showed Thursday. The four-week average, a less-volatile measure, declined to 220,750.

The latest decline in claims, which remain near a historically low level, is in line with a tight labor market as indicated in the monthly jobs report for December. At the same time, the partial federal-government shutdown—which affects one-quarter of agencies and is now the longest in U.S. history—is likely to cause some filings to increase in coming weeks.

Initial filings by federal employees jumped to 10,454 on an unadjusted basis in the week ended Jan.5, reflecting the second week of the shutdown that’s caused the furlough of thousands of workers. That’s up from 4,760 in the week ended Dec. 29 and a previously reported 929 in the week ended Dec. 22.

Details on claims by federal employees are reported with a lag, and analysts caution that it may take more time for the closures to be fully reflected in the report.

Continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag, increased to 1.737 million in the week ended Jan. 5. The unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits held at 1.2% for a sixth week.

112617,cnsnews,"(CNSNews.com) – The Appropriations Committee in the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives on Thursday will consider a draft bill on foreign affairs and aid funding – including contributions to the United Nations – that provides $13.7 billion more than President Trump’s fiscal year 2020 budget request.

The $56.4 billion bill, which was approved last week by the Appropriations subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations, represents a 32-percent increase over the president’s FY2020 request of $42.7 billion. That includes an 87.3 percent increase in the amount he requested for contributions for peacekeeping missions – $2.128 billion compared to the requested $1.136 billion.

Beyond the numbers, the funding bill also contains several specific measures opposed by Republicans, relating to issues such as abortion around the world and U.N. global warming initiatives.

Earlier, a Republican committee member warned that unless partisan measures targeting “the president’s policy of protecting life” were removed, the bill stood no chance of passing.

Significantly, the bill includes legislation called the Global Health Empowerment and Rights (HER) Act, which seeks to permanently repeal the Mexico City Policy.

The Reagan-era measure, recently strengthened by the Trump administration, targets funding for non-governmental organizations that promote or perform abortions abroad, as well as funding for NGOs that give money to other NGOs that promote or perform abortions.

The Global HER Act, introduced by Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) last February, has 171 co-sponsors, all Democrats. The Senate version, introduced by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), has 46 co-sponsors, including Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Susan Collins (Me.)

Lowey chairs both the Appropriations State and Foreign Operations subcommittee and the full committee, and will be presiding over Thursday’s mark-up.

The draft funding bill also provides for $55.5 million for the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA), which Trump defunded in 2017 over reported links to China’s coercive birth-limitation policies.

Another provision expected to draw GOP opposition is the removal of a prohibition of U.S. funding for the Green Climate Fund, a major U.N. global warming initiative which Trump also defunded in 2017.

The bill furthermore prohibits the use of funds to withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate agreement. (The administration last August lodged formal notification that the U.S. was pulling out of the accord, although the actual withdrawal process takes at least three years.)

When the subcommittee considered the bill last week, Lowey said the legislation “rejects the administration’s unacceptable, irresponsible fiscal year 2020 requests and reaffirms strong support for reproductive health, climate change, and multilateral assistance.”

Committee member Rep. Lois Frankel (D-Fla.) praised provisions which, she said, reverse the administration’s “brutal attack on women’s reproductive health and rights.”

Ranking member Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) praised some elements – such as support for U.S. allies in the Middle East, and for embassy security – but said it was “a shame that these types of programs are undermined by partisan policy riders that will end any hope of support for this bill from both sides of the aisle.”

“The sweeping measures included in the bill to overturn the president’s policy of protecting life and global health go well beyond what was done previously,” he said. “Unless these provisions are taken out of the bill, Madame Chair, it has no hope of becoming law.”

Rogers also questioned the wisdom or putting forward a bill with topline numbers that would not win the support of the House and Senate, or the administration.

Among other things, the bill adds funding to USAID ($1.690 billion), the Peace Corps ($425 million), and the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief or PEPFAR ($5.93 billion).

The PEPFAR funding includes $1.56 billion for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and reiterates a longstanding U.S. commitment to continue to provide 33 percent of the fund’s budget. The administration’s proposed budget sought to reduce that commitment to 25 percent.

When the administration presented its State and Foreign Operations budget request in March, Democratic leaders were quick to label it “dead on arrival” in Congress.

Doug Pitkin, director of the State Department’s Bureau of Budget and Planning, told reporters at the time that the proposed budget includes reductions in programs which the administration “believes are either a lower priority or perhaps are not the best use of taxpayer dollars.”

He said the administration was continuing to ask for smaller amounts for contributions to international organizations than Congress has approved, “as an effort to try to drive greater burden-sharing among those organizations.”

The Better World Campaign (BWC), a group that “works to foster a strong relationship between the U.S. and the U.N.,” was critical of the budget proposal, and is praising the draft bill.

“This legislation embraces the principle that the United States cannot go it alone in stamping out extremism or eradicating disease – we need the UN as our partner,” said BWC president Peter Yeo.

“Elections have consequences,” commented U.N. Dispatch managing editor Mark Leon Goldberg, whose site is sponsored by the United Nations Foundation.

“This was the first budget drafted by the State and Foreign Operations subcommittee in which Democrats held the majority and the result was increased funding for the United Nations.”",Foreign Ops Funding Bill Includes Measures Targeting Trump’s ‘Policy of Protecting Life’,"disaster, accident and emergency incident",emergency planning,825
50533,bipartisanreport,"On Monday, in a move that’s sure to make Trump and all of his MAGA-hat-wearing followers even crazier, a Federal judge in San Francisco blocked “an experimental Trump administration policy that requires asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases make their way through the U.S. immigration court system.”

‘U.S. District Judge Richard ­Seeborg in San Francisco enjoined the Migrant Protection Protocols(MPP) policy days after outgoing Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen pledged to expand the program. The policy began in January at the San Ysidro port of entry in California but has been extended to the Calexico, Calif., entry and to the entry in El Paso, and Seeborg wrote that the approach would have been further extended if the court had not stepped in. ‘Several hundred migrants have been returned to Mexico under the program after seeking asylum at the border.’

‘The ruling — a preliminary injunction at least temporarily stopping the program — paralyzes one of the Trump administration’s last remaining tools to stem the flow of Central American families trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border, an influx that has hit decade-long highs and has infuriated the president. Trump took out some of that frustration on the Department of Homeland Security in recent days: Nielsen resigned days after the White House rescinded the nomination of one of her top deputies, Ronald Vitiello, to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement.’

Seeborg said in his 27-page ruling that “the legal question before him was not whether the MPP is a wise, intelligent, or humane policy, or whether it is the best approach for addressing the circumstances the executive branch contends constitute a crisis,” but that the program may violate  the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Administrative Procedures Act. These laws are in place to ensure that immigrants, as the judge puts it, “are not returned to unduly dangerous circumstances.”

70183,bonginoreport,"The Chinese Communist Party instructed the Bible and other religious texts to be rewritten in an expressly pro-communist perspective that conforms with the party’s goals.

In November, a group of 16 different experts and religious representatives were called on to attend a meeting of the Chinese Committee for Ethnic and Religious Affairs of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference. Those religious leaders were then instructed to review their religious texts and reinterpret them to conform with the values of the country’s communist party doctrine, according to the Daily Mail.

Wang Yang, Chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, reportedly told the gathered religious leaders they must interpret their religious views in their texts to meet the instructions of Communist Party Chairman Xi Jinping and fulfill “the requirements of the era.”

Those selected religious officials reportedly agreed with instructions of the Chinese ruling Communist Party and agreed to undertake the effort to review and amend or re-translate their various religious texts.

The religious leaders reportedly said their efforts would help prevent “extreme thoughts” and “heretical ideas” from undermining China.

News of the new religious requirements follows reports of other Chinese efforts to crackdown on various faith groups in recent years; including the detainment of nearly 2 million minority Uyghur’s, held in concentration camps in the Xinjiang region. China has denied the existence of the camps and reportedly described facilities as “boarding schools” to provide job training and discourage radicalization.

China has also arrested various religious leaders like Pastor Wang Yi, and have instated bans preventing other religious leaders from attending religious conferences abroad.

In a recent move, Chinese officials in the eastern province of Jiangxi ordered a Catholic church to remove a painting of the Virgin Mary and her baby, Jesus Christ, and replaced it with an image of Chairman Xi. They were also told to hang Chinese flags and pro-communist party slogans throughout the church.

In addition, the church was instructed to remove its name from public display and instead to hang a banner that reads: “Follow the party, thank the party, obey the party.”

Authorities also reportedly threatened older members of that Catholic church and warned that they could lose their pensions if they continued worshipping at the church.

Chinese authorities have reportedly told Catholic churches that have not joined the government-backed Patriotic Catholic Association that they would be labeled as a cult. Such a designation would reportedly subject them to further persecution.",China Wants to Insert Communist Propaganda into the Bible and Other Religious Texts,religion and belief,religious text,399
104616,cnn,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump bestowed Tiger Woods with the nation's highest civilian honor , the Presidential Medal of Freedom, on Monday evening in the White House Rose Garden, hailing Woods as a ""global symbol of American excellence.""

The duo shares a love of the game of golf, but both have also risen to unpredictable and spectacular comebacks: Trump from bankruptcy to the presidency; Woods from public shaming following multiple affairs, injuries and a resulting painkiller addiction, to winning this year's Masters.

Trump recalled Woods' historic career from 1997 to his 2019 Masters win, including his injuries and miraculous comeback.

When the President discussed the 2019 Masters win, he also noted that Woods' run broke television records that day as well.

""Congratulations again on your amazing comeback and your amazing life and for giving sports fans everywhere a lifetime of memories,"" Trump said.

Woods received a standing ovation upon the beginning of his remarks.

""This has been an unbelievable experience,"" Woods said, thanking his family, including his late father.

The Medal of Freedom recognizes individuals who have made ""an especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavors,"" according to the executive order designating the award. Since taking office, Trump has presented the award to numerous athletes, including Alan Page, Roger Staubach, and a posthumous award to Babe Ruth

Trump, who has a long history with Woods, said in a tweet after the Masters that he had congratulated the golfer on the win and his comeback, announcing that he would be giving him the award.

""Spoke to @TigerWoods to congratulate him on the great victory he had in yesterday's @TheMasters, & to inform him that because of his incredible Success & Comeback in Sports (Golf) and, more importantly, LIFE, I will be presenting him with the PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM!"" the tweet said.

Woods' career slumped following his divorce and surrounding scandal in late 2009 and early 2010. He lost about $20 million from estimated endorsements after sponsors including Gatorade, AT&T, and Accenture cut ties. After a string of losses in 2011, Woods failed to make the World Golf Ranking's top 50 players list. But one fan who stuck with him: Donald Trump, who supported the embattled golfer in March 2013 via Twitter.

While it's entirely up to the President's discretion as to who receives the Medal of Freedom, the choice of Woods, who at 43 is still relatively young compared to other recipients, has raised eyebrows for Trump's business ties to the pro golfer.

Trump, an avid golfer, owns courses across the world and frequently hits the links, playing most recently this Saturday at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia. His Trump National Doral in Miami has a villa named for Woods. According to The New York Times , Woods celebrated his first Masters win in 1997 at Trump's Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

And, per the Times, Woods is designing a course in Dubai that would be managed by the Trump Organization. Though it was expected to be completed by the end of 2017, it has yet to open, and a spokesman for Woods declined to comment to the Times.

The President has played multiple rounds with Woods, including alongside Jack Nicklaus in February at Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida.

""He picks whoever's playing the best and puts himself on their team, and it may -- he may change teams two or three times in a round. It's just fun,"" he told Fox News, adding, ""It's a faux competition but it's just fun. If somebody hits a bad shot, he just tells them, 'Drop another ball, we're out here having fun.' There's no stress in it.""

130938,dailyheraldchicago,"Workers have begun installing solar panels on Huntley Community School District 158's campuses -- expected to be three of the largest installations at Illinois public schools.

The arrays are expected to be operational by spring, district spokesman Dan Armstrong said Thursday.

The district is partnering with California-based Forefront Power to install solar panels with 5.6 megawatts of photovoltaic capacity on roughly 20 acres across its campuses in Algonquin, Huntley and Lake in the Hills. The ground-mounted installations are expected to save the district $4.2 million over 20 years while offsetting 12.3 million pounds of carbon emissions, officials said.

District 158 currently pays roughly 11 cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity, and its yearly energy cost is more than $1 million.

Forefront will design, permit, finance, install and maintain the solar installations for the 20-year term. The project is estimated to cost about $8 million. District 158 would then pay for the electricity generated by the system at a lower price than its existing utility rate.

Officials anticipate between 10% and 30% in savings on energy costs drawing power from the solar installations.

Nationally, K-12 schools spend more than $6 billion yearly on energy, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. And at least a quarter of that could be saved through smarter energy management, improvements to existing buildings and building smarter new schools, the agency reports.

Installations are underway at District 158's Square Barn Road and Reed Road campuses. Work hasn't yet begun at the Harmony Road campus housing Huntley High School.

Armstrong said ground-mounted arrays are preferable to rooftop installations, which are more complicated and require a lot of preparation work and more maintenance. The installations will be visible at all three campuses, but will not be obtrusive, he added.

""We worked with the villages and other entities on siting these in terms of maximum efficiency and also being good neighbors,"" Armstrong said. ""We have land at each of our campuses that is suitable for this use, so we are putting it to good use. It was not really a concern of ours to try to hide these away from passersby or visitors to our campuses. We want people to know we are leading this effort in environmental sustainability as well as fiscal responsibility.""

Forefront offers free solar energy curriculum to partner school districts. Students can observe and analyze system production using a monitoring platform and lesson plans are based on Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards. The company provides guest speakers for classroom visits, assemblies, guided walk-throughs of installations and technical presentations.

District 158 also will be working with two other providers -- Schools Power and Legends of Learning -- to develop its solar energy curriculum.

Schools Power provides school districts and community colleges with a renewable energy curriculum package, while Legends of Learning offers a game-based learning platform, Armstrong said.",District 158 solar panels will be operational by spring,environment,natural resources,461
165071,eveningstandard,"These days, you can find a fitness tracker to monitor pretty much everything.

From how much you slept, your running splits and calories burned to what you ate and how your ticker’s doing — it's all possible with a fitness tracker.

The most globally famous company to bring us these nifty little devices is, of course, FitBit, which has earned its reputation as one of the most reliable wearable tech companies out there.

The brand now has several fitness devices available, each one offering slightly different benefits. The great thing about this is that there’s almost certainly a device to suit your needs — but where to start?

A good place to start is by figuring out what you actually want it for - and it’s worth being totally honest with yourself here.

Prone as we are to put all our hopes and dreams on a tracker to transform us into fitness gods and goddesses, the reality is that these devices can’t actually do the work for us.  They can, however, monitor our own efforts and, in doing so, encourage us to sleep more, move more and eat a healthier diet.

They’re basically the tech equivalent of an overbearing mother.

So whether you’re looking to get your 10,000 steps in each day, monitor your running and cycling PBs or just want to work out why you feel so tired every morning, we’ve got the inside plug on the best Fitbits to buy in 2019.

With all its bells and whistles, the Charge 3 is the tracker equivalent of Jarvis the robot in Iron Man. It’s got a seriously impressive list of features, such as a 24/7 heart rate monitor, a calorie tracker, sleep monitor and can be linked up to your phone so you can see incoming calls and texts.

Water resistant up to 50 meters, it’s the best option for serious swimmers and it’ll deliver helpful, personalised insights after each workout session. The screen (which is slightly bigger than the Charge 2’s)  is spacious enough to not feel cramped but is still streamline enough to not feel bulky on the wrist. We’re fans of the blue grey/ rose gold option as it looks a little less severe than the black.

The only downside we can see is that it doesn’t have a built in GPS system, so can’t be taken out for a run without your phone. Available in other colours.

Hurrah! Finally a Fitbit that can track GPS. The Ionic was Fitbit’s first smartwatch (and quickly followed by the Versa) and is one of the only models to offer navigation, so can actually be taken out without a phone - excellent if you’re a runner looking to cut own on all the bulky accessories.

The build quality of this one feels a little more sophisticated than that of the Versa, though its design is slightly retro — great for some but not as upmarket-looking as some of the other smartwatches out there. It does, however, feel more likely to withstand a tough workout or swimming session thanks to its robust design.

It can hold up to 2.5GB of storage, so you can easily load several playlists or keep a log of previous workouts. Thanks to the incorporation of its own operating system, Fitbit OS, it can run independent as well as third party apps - something that most other contenders can’t do. The display measures almost 1.5 inches and is surprisingly clear and detailed for its size.

It does claim to hold its charge for up to five days but realistically you’ll need to plug it in after three. Available in other colours.

OK - you might take one look at the Flex 2 and think it looks more like a locker wristband than a piece of tech, but hear us out. Sure, it doesn’t have a screen but if you think about it, this could actually be a plus - especially for the technophobes amongst us.

Despite its diminutive size, it still does all the usual tracker stuff, from exercise and sleep to calorie and step counting. So how exactly does it work? All the tracking is logged on the device but all the info you’ll receive comes through the app on your phone, which connects via bluetooth.

Another good swimming option, the Flex 2 is waterproof up to 50 metres, so if you happen to be heading out for a scuba diving session, take it along for the ride. You may have noticed the little flashing lights, which convey by a sort of morse code, various nuggets of information. It’s worth taking 10 minutes to figure out what the sequences mean, or you’re likely to spend its lifespan staring bewilderedly at your wrist every time it flashes.

It’s big plus points are its weight (or lack thereof) and five day battery life. The only things really holding it back are the time it takes to charge - you’ll need to leave it to replenish its battery overnight - and the popper fastening, which is a little less secure than a proper buckle. Available in other colours.

With its streamlined desigh, the Charge 2 is a little more compact than the 3, offering users a fuss-free fitness tracker experience.

It comes with a slim screen, which shows off all the different control features in a simple, easy-to-read interface. There’s a side button that allows you to move through the different features or, alternatively, you can tap on the screen to do so.

Don’t confuse this with a proper touchscreen, though - it’s not particularly sensitive and has to be tapped in exactly the right spot in order to respond. For those who like to take on multiple workouts, it recognises several different forms of exercise such as running, cycling and weightlifting and if you go into the app you can access different training programs, allowing you to use it as a sort of pseudo personal trainer.

The best thing about this one is that, because of the screen, you can check various bits of data without having to check your phone - ideal if you are easily distracted or are trying to reduce your screen time. Available in other colours.

Fitbit put out the HR as a step up from the Alta with - you’ve guessed it - heart rate tracking. It doesn’t look particularly different from the original model but thanks to the monitoring feature, offers much more accurate fitness data. It also has a buckle strap, making it more secure to wear day-to-day. So who should choose this one?

Well, it doesn’t offer as sophisticated real time monitoring as the smartwatch options, which will display your workout stats on the screen rather than in a phone app, but it’s pretty comprehensive when it comes to the usual calorie, sleep and step tracking stuff and actually offers more in-depth analysis than the original design.

Those fascinated by their sleeping patterns will love the insights they receive, such as quality of sleep during the week versus the weekend. It’s also got a nifty new move reminder feature, so if you’ve been sat in front of the TV for too long it’ll give you a nudge to go out for a walk. The screen itself is slimline and touch sensitive and pretty intuitive to navigate - simply swipe to see the different pieces of data.

This one does automatically recognise different forms of exercise, so if you start running for the bus it’ll track it, but it doesn’t actually allow you to manually start or stop workouts. Don’t really know how this affects you? Basically put, if you’re a serious exerciser, you might want to choose something a little more comprehensive. Available in other colours.

Fitbit’s smartwatch sequel, the Versa is compatible with Android, iOS and Windows. The screen is slim, streamline and touch sensitive, so you can swipe through the apps with speed and ease. It’s great in low light, too, so if you choose to look at it in the middle of the night, it won’t momentarily blind you the way that smartphones tend to do.

It also manages to be large enough to show you multiple pieces of information at once without looking like you’ve strapped a TV to your wrist and offers more extensive monitoring than several of the other models as well as music storage and Fitbit Pay. As with most Fitbit trackers, you can change up the straps to suit your taste if you wish, though you’ll need a bit of patience to do it - it’s quite fiddly and time-consuming. Available in other colours.

The Blaze is one of the most versatile on the list, offering users three different screen sizes and several strap options, including a metal one, which is particularly heartening for all those who don’t particularly like the toy-like look of fitness trackers.

This can be done by removing the screen from the device - something that, annoyingly, you’ll also have to do every time you need to charge it. On the plus side, it’ll keep going for about five days.

The display itself is extremely clear and colourful, making it simple to use and navigate. It also features an in-built gyroscope, so whenever you twist your wrist to see the time, it’ll automatically flash up on the screen - like magic.

This one comes with a heart rate monitor, which has become sophisticated enough to deal with most cardio and HIIT workouts, although it might struggle to accurately record weight training data because of the type of movement. Via the app, you can also set up alarms - so it’ll wake you with a gentle vibration each morning - as well as daily goals, so you can work towards increasing your step count or calories burned. Available in other colours.

1027824,thetorontostar,"SANTIAGO, Chile - Chile’s navy on Sunday confirmed the spillage of 40,000 litres of diesel oil into the sea in a remote and pristine area of the South American country’s Patagonia and said it is working to mitigate the effects. A navy statement said it received a call from the mining company CAP on Saturday reporting the spill at the terminal of Guarello island, about 1,740 miles (2,800 kilometres) south from Santiago, Chile’s capital. The area is one of the planet’s most untouched with important biodiversity.

The navy said it had deployed ships to the area to control damage from the spill and an investigation had been launched. “The marine pollution control centre was activated,” Ronald Baasch, commander of the navy’s Third Naval Zone, told local media. CAP released a statement saying the incident had already been contained. The spill affected a bay and the company said it installed a container sleeve in the area on Saturday and began removing oil from the environment immediately.

Oil prices tumbled up to 5% on Wednesday to a fresh seven-month low, extending recent heavy losses following an unexpected build in U.S. crude stockpiles and fears of lower crude demand due to deepening U.S.-China trade tensions.

Brent crude futures LCOc1 were down $2.38, or 4%, at $56.56 a barrel by 10:36 a.m. CDT (1536 GMT), setting a fresh seven-month low. Prices have lost more than 20% since hitting their 2019 peak in April, Reuters said.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were down $2.66, or 5%, at $50.97.

Oil extended losses after government data showed U.S. crude stockpiles rose last week by 2.4 million barrels. Analysts had expected a decrease of 2.8 million barrels. At 438.9 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories are about 2% above the five-year average for this time of year.

Gasoline inventories rose by 4.4 million barrels, with U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline stocks hitting the highest on record for this time of year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data showed.

98797,cnbc,"The House Judiciary Committee on Monday laid out plans to issue subpoenas for special counsel Robert Mueller's ""full and complete"" report on Russian meddling in the 2016 election, as well as the raw evidence that supports it.

The committee, led by Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., set a Wednesday morning date to mark up a resolution to authorize the subpoenas. Members will be able to vote on the resolution at the hearing.

""As I have made clear, Congress requires the full and complete Special Counsel report, without redactions, as well as access to the underlying evidence,"" Nadler said in a statement.

Nadler's resolution would also issue subpoenas to five former associates of President Donald Trump, including former White House counsel Don McGahn, former top strategist Steve Bannon and former communications director Hope Hicks.

Democrats' preparations to try to force the release of Mueller's report follow their growing complaints about Attorney General William Barr's handling of the findings, which was delivered to him by the special counsel on March 22. Two days later, Barr sent a four-page summary of the ""principal conclusions"" to House and Senate Judiciary committee leaders, claiming, ""The special counsel's investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.""

Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein also concluded, based on the report, that there wasn't enough evidence to establish that Trump obstructed justice. Barr quotes Mueller as saying that ""while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.""

Trump and his supporters claimed ""total and complete exoneration"" from the summary, while Democrats demanded that Barr immediately release the entire report without redactions.

Barr, in a letter sent to Congress on Friday, said he expects to deliver a version of the nearly 400-page report to lawmakers by mid-April, ""if not sooner."" He said the material being redacted includes grand jury-related information, as well as information that could reveal U.S. sources and methods or confidential details about ongoing investigations.

Nadler other Democratic leaders had set a Tuesday deadline for Barr to hand over the long-awaited report. The Judiciary Committee's top Republican, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, called that deadline ""arbitrary.""

Much of the contention about the report concerns what, if anything, is required by law to be redacted.

Barr's most recent letter states that any material in the report subject to the federal rules on grand juries ""by law cannot be made public."" But Democrats have pointed to past examples, such as the Watergate scandal, when federal Judge John Sirica in March 1974 granted special prosecutor Leon Jaworski's request to give grand jury materials to the House Judiciary Committee.

""This is political theater,"" a senior administration official told NBC News on Monday. ""Chairman Nadler is demanding the release of secret grand jury information and classified material – which is against the law. He should allow the Attorney General to complete his work and stop playing politics.""

Collins, responding to Nadler's announcement Monday morning, took Barr's stance. ""Judiciary Democrats have escalated from setting arbitrary deadlines to demanding unredacted material that Congress does not, in truth, require and that the law does not allow to be shared outside the Justice Department,"" Collins said.

""It's unfortunate that a body meant to uphold the law has grown so desperate that it's patently misrepresenting the law, even as the attorney general has already demonstrated transparency above and beyond what is required.""

In addition to McGahn, Hicks and Bannon, the Judiciary Committee will also vote on whether to issue subpoenas for Trump's former chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and ex-White House counsel Ann Donaldson, who had also served as McGahn's chief of staff.

""These individuals may have received documents from the White House relevant to the special counsel investigation and the Committee's investigation, or their outside counsel may have,"" Nadler's press release said.

In early March, Nadler's committee launched a sweeping corruption probe into Trump and dozens of his associates and his family members.

That probe is intended to look into alleged obstruction of justice by Trump and others and the ""alleged cover-up of violations of the law""; alleged corruption in areas including violations of the Constitution's emoluments clause ""and other criminal misuses of official positions for personal gain""; and alleged abuses of power, such as attacking the press and misusing the presidential pardon power.

Some of the 81 people and entities asked to provide documents have yet to respond, or have publicly refused to comply with the probe, Nadler said.

""I am particularly concerned about reports that documents relevant to the Special Counsel investigation were sent outside the White House, waving applicable privileges,"" he added. ""To this end, I have asked the Committee to authorize me to issue subpoenas, if necessary, to compel the production of documents and testimony.""",House Judiciary Committee plans to vote to subpoena the 'complete' Mueller report,"crime, law and justice",judiciary,792

911372,therussophileorg,"This post was originally published on this site

The New York Times recently published an opinion piece by its gun-grabbing, open borders in-house “conservative” columnist Bret Stephens asserting that Ashkenazi Jews are an elite race by nature of their superior hereditary, culture and soul.

For sure, there are Jews of exceptional intellect and ability, but this is true for most races. Stephen’s dictation is an evacuation straight from the bowels of Zionist ideology into the minds of the liberal status quo beneath his feet. His inference is the contention that Jewish domination of Western cultural, economic and political choke points is a product of natural selection rather than nepotism and propaganda.

A cursory glance of history puts the Jews to shame.

When it comes to innovation, no nation has punched outside of its weight class like Scotland. With a modern population of 4.5 million and less than a million in England, Scots have gifted mankind with radar technology, Penicillin, the telephone, the vacuum flask and much more. Unlike abstractions like Marxism, Freudianism and Relativity, these inventions have have drastically improved the lives of all human beings and taken civilization to new heights.

In the sciences, Stephens points to Jews winning Nobel prizes at a disproportionate rate as evidence of their genius. Yet it is Swedes, with a population smaller than Jewry, who have discovered 20 elements on the Periodic Table, only slightly trailing the United Kingdom (24) and America (21) in the race to understand the hidden nuances of the world around us.

As a complement to Nordic scientific prowess, the smallest branch of the Latin-Mediterranean race, Portugal – a nation which during the 1500s had a population of less than 2 million – rose to prominence in the Age of Discovery, helping man fill an otherwise blank map of the globe.

Despite being a tiny sliver of land off the Iberian peninsula surrounded by hostile powers, Portugal had by the 16th century developed ships that shattered European limitations in sea travel (the equivalent of going to space at the time) to circumnavigated Earth and split claims to much of the newly discovered world with Spain at the Treaty of Tordesillas. The plucky Portuguese had a presence seemingly everywhere, with holdings and ports as far as Japan and India, not to mention permanent cultural and racial imprints in Africa and Latin America.

What, in comparison, are the major achievements of the booming Ashkenazi Jewish population during this time period? They may have a presence on every continent today, but only thanks to infrastructure and discoveries by nations like Portugal.

The biggest hole in the contemporary race theories Stephens quotes, by delineating Ashkenazis from Sephardics, is that the rise and fall in prominence of the two groups coincides with the arc of their hosts. When Latins ruled the world, it was Sephardics (including those expelled from Spain) who composed the elite of world Jewry in Britain, Holland, and so on. With Anglo-Saxon powers, Germany and the ethnic go-between of France taking Spain and Portugal’s place as superpowers, suddenly Ashkenazis woke up to find themselves in the driver’s seat. This suggests civilizational parasitism, not independent genius.

We can see other examples of Jewish underachievement in the Classical world. New studies show that the Roman Empire at its peak had a population of 5 million, while estimates of the Jewish population in times before Christ range from 3 to 8 million (Josephus claimed 1.1 million Jews died during the First Roman-Jewish War alone). Jews are purported to have had large armies and empires, but they were largely pastoralists who shared more in common with the Mongols in their violent disdain for high culture and intolerance, leaving behind few literary or technological achievements. Even the Western Wall, which Jews claim is their ancient Temple, is nothing more than the remnant of a Roman army fort.

The Myth of Einstein and “Relativity Hype”

Stephens emphasizes the cultural meme of Albert Einstein as the core evidence demonstrating the intellectual prowess of the Jews.

Jews are indeed highly overrepresented as Nobel Prize winners in the world of physics, where many of the theories are abstract and difficult (if not impossible) to prove or disprove, but are not very well represented in the most significant developments in the field in the last three decades: Quantum Teleportation (one Jew out of six authors), the Bose-Einstein Condensate (independently discovered by the Indian Satyendra Nath Bose yet credited to Einstein who merely reiterated the work afterwards), the “God Particle” (Peter Higgs and Francois Englert), etc.

The Einstein question thus personifies the problem with claims of Jewish superiority.

The theory of relativity was controversial inside the European scientific community when it was released in 1905 without peer review. Nobel Prize winning German physicists Johannes Stark and Philipp Lenard were open opponents of it due to what they saw as hijacking physics away from illustrative and intuitive norms towards unfalsifiable abstractions and overemphasis on math.

The German physics community’s main issue with the Einstein phenomenon was not just the theory, but how normal scientific standards were suspended to declare Einstein the new Copernicus.

This declaration was made by Einstein’s (a Zionist activist deeply integrated with pan-Jewry) fellow Jews in the press, which critics dubbed “relativity hype.” This both surprised and infuriated his colleagues. A book released in 1924 by renown physicist Ernst Gehrcke, “The Mass Suggestion of Relativity Theory,” recorded 5,000 newspaper articles affirming with no proof that Einstein had shattered all previous notions in classical physics despite the jury still being out among many of his most respected peers.

Einstein’s genius is the work of publicists and mass suggestion, in other words. Additionally, Einstein did not discover relativity, but merely reconstituted discoveries by Joseph Larmor (released in 1897 and work by Henri Poincare (published in 1898), both who abided by classical scientific norms. Whatever the merits or demerits of E=mc2, it was the Italian Galileo Galilei who first theorized about relativity in 1632. When confronted with these facts or dissenting opinions throughout his career, Einstein’s go-to tactic was to take to the newspapers that loved him and accuse his detractors of “anti-Semitism.”

With modern technology, the theory of relativity has been challenged time and time again. Every year a new scientist outside of the oxygen-deprived and politicized Western academy, like in India or Russia, provides mathematical or even common sense (like mass and energy being interchangeable) wrenches in the relativity machine, at least as Einstein proposed it. In 2011, the highly respected CERN caused waves in the media by seemingly disproving the core arguments attributed to Einstein when neutrinos sped faster than light during a high-tech experiment.

After outcry and dismay from certain gatekeepers in academia and the media, CERN claimed that a cable in their machine was loose and the previous results were not recreated after adjustment. While this incident alone does not prove an attempt to protect Einstein’s legacy, fear within the scientific community of losing grants in resource-starved physics research by making discoveries financial and political kingmakers do not like should not dismissed either.

Today, Albert Einstein’s reputation as the smartest man who ever lived is bolstered by a seemingly infinite number of books, TV shows, and movies celebrating his life and supposed achievements – far more than any other scientist in history. Jews excel in physics on paper but it was Einstein’s “common sense” oriented scientific opponents in the Third Reich that first developed the rocket technology that allowed us to reach space.

While this author is out of his element when it comes to the nuts and bolts of relativity, one looks at the Jewish spirit’s replacement of reason and intuition with abstraction and relativism in other fields like the arts, anthropology, culture of critique or music, and questions should arise regarding whether Einstein’s similar approach towards Physics has been more of a retarding arbitrary rule scientists are pressured to work within the confines of rather than the groundbreaking accomplishment we are expected to take for granted. Would this supposed “consensus” still be so if Germany had won the Second World War and science was freed of top-down Jewish pressure from people like Bret Stephens?

It is generally assumed that the hard sciences are free from political ideology, but challenging the Einstein myth provokes the same institutional reaction as James Watson affirming the biology of race (outside of the Jewish superiority context Bret Stephens and the New York Times has deemed appropriate). We are convinced that Jews are our masters only because celebrating the group-achievements of far more accomplished Europeans is forbidden by the establishment.

The brilliance of the plagiarist Einstein embodies the nature of Stephens’ broader patronizing claims of born-to-rule Jewish excellence: it may look like a diamond, but it’s synthetic like a zirconia.","Jewish Brilliance: Synthetic Like Zirconia, by Eric Striker",science and technology,scientific standards,1434
780541,theindependent,"A 26-year-old woman has been killed and three others injured after a head-on crash between a National Express coach and a small car in southwest London.

The vehicles were engulfed in flames after they collided in the early hours of Sunday morning on Queenstown Road, in Battersea.

The rear-seat passenger of the grey Volkswagen Polo car died at the scene and the female driver is in a critical condition, said the Metropolitan Police, which is investigating the incident.

In footage circulating on social media, police and ambulance crews can be seen trying to dampen the flames and rescue people from inside.

Witnesses can be heard saying the vehicles “exploded” after crashing into each other.

Images show the car to have been a Zipcar rental vehicle, which can be hired by the hour.

One passenger on the A3 service from Gatwick to London Victoria was taken to hospital, while all other passengers were safely transferred to a replacement vehicle, a National Express spokesman said.

“Emergency services attended the scene and we will continue to provide every assistance with the ongoing investigation,” they said. “Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the occupant of the car, who sadly passed away.”

A London Ambulance Service spokesman said that despite the “best efforts of our medics, one patient sadly died at the scene”.

“We took a second patient to a major trauma centre as a priority. We treated two further patients for minor injuries: we took one of them to hospital and the other was discharged at the scene.”

29620,bbc,"Fossils are in fashion, with private buyers snapping up prehistoric remains online and at auction but the trend is raising concerns within the scientific community.

In the saleroom at Christie's auction house in London, buyers are crowding round to view - not works of fine art, antique furniture or jewellery - but fossils from an era so far in the past it is hard to fathom.

There are Triceratops horns, the teeth of a Tyrannosaurus rex, and the tail of a duck-billed dinosaur from 66 million years ago.

Bidders from as far apart as California and Hungary join the auction online and the murmurs of excitement rise as the room is shown slides of such palaeontological treasures as oil-black teeth from a Megalodon - a giant prehistoric shark - or Sauropod eggs and fossilised dragonflies.

Private buyers have been showing a growing interest in ancient remains over the past few years. Bidders from more than 50 countries regularly participate in sales like these, says James Hyslop, head of science and natural history at Christie's.

Celebrity interest - Leonardo DiCaprio, Russell Crowe and Nicolas Cage are all known to have bought prehistoric treasures - has helped make them fashionable.

Such fossils may not yet compete with fine art in terms of the most expensive sale tags, but the boom in interest means that prices are rising.

Elephant bird eggs sold for £20,000-30,000 a decade ago, for example - now they're selling for £100,000.

Mr Hyslop points out one of the sale's rarest specimens: a female ichthyosaur fossil. At 3.5m (11ft) this is the largest ever sold at auction. This prehistoric fish-lizard swam the oceans of the early Jurassic, 184 million years ago.

On close inspection there are also the rare remains of two embryos in its rib cage: it was pregnant. It finally sells for £240,000 to an anonymous buyer.

Mr Hyslop puts the growing interest in prehistoric remains down to a generation that grew up on the first batch of Jurassic Park films (1993-2001).

""We love this subject,"" he says. ""People just love what it stands for"". What it stands for is a combination of popular science and popular history, but also the excitement of breaking new ground. According to National Geographic, 50 new species of dinosaur are being discovered every year.

On the online trading site eBay, Mosasaur fossils are popular. The remains of these striking marine reptiles are now changing hands at a rate of around 100 every month in the UK - a 42% increase on the year before.

But you can also find Triceratops skulls and baby Allosaurus skeletons, ranging in price from a few thousand pounds to hundreds of thousands - eBay reported a 22% increase in fossil sales last year.

However this rising popularity is concerning scientists: for one thing it is fuelling the illicit trade in fossils.

While some countries like the US, will allow private fossil hunters to sell-on their finds on a ""finders keepers"" basis, many others including China, Mongolia and Brazil ban the export of all specimens. They're also working to reclaim illegally excavated specimens.

The 70 million-year-old skull of a Tyrannosaurus bataar, an Asian relative to Tyrannosaurus rex, that actor Nicolas Cage bought at auction in the US in 2012, was later reclaimed by the Mongolian government, for example.

Yet the palaeontologist who won that legal battle, Bolortsetseg Minjin, says despite the Mongolian government's determination to stem the flow there are still plenty of new cases of poaching, which she says risk causing irrevocable damage to the specimens.

""Poachers don't have skills and only go for the parts that'll make them money, like destroying whole skeletons just for teeth,"" she says. ""It's treating them like a commodity but these fossils are priceless.""

Private buyers might not realise it, she says, but unless they are sure of a fossil's provenance, buying it could indirectly be causing harm by fuelling that black market trade.

The booming private market can have a knock-on negative effect even when legal, says Dr Susannah Maidment from the Earth Sciences department of London's Natural History Museum.

""The problem is these specimens go on sale for huge amounts of money, far more than museums can afford.

""Our acquisition budget for specimens across the entire museum, not just palaeontology, amounts to tens of thousands of pounds annually. But many of these big dinosaur specimens will sell for well over a million dollars,"" she explains.

When specimens are privately owned that can act as a barrier to scientific research, she argues.

One of the London Natural History Museum's prize exhibits is Sophie, a 151 million-year-old complete Stegosaurus skeleton. Before the museum acquired it, no-one actually knew how many bones there were in the backbone of a Stegosaurus or how many plates it had along its spine, says Dr Maidment.

The museum, like many other scientific institutions, won't research or publish work on privately-owned specimens as a matter of principle, because scientific rigour relies on replicating research. A private owner may allow one researcher to examine their fossil but then might refuse access to others.

More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:

On the other hand, the process of exploration and excavation is labour intensive and expensive.

""It's a conflict because we don't have the resources to collect these ourselves, and we wouldn't know about them if commercial dealers weren't digging them up,"" Dr Maidment says.

Yet when the purpose of the excavation is private profit there's the risk that gathering essential contextual data will be neglected, she adds.

Mr Hyslop argues we shouldn't demonise private buyers as if they were ""a Bond villain who's sitting on his dinosaur bones and never letting anyone else look at them"". Many private buyers are happy for their items to be displayed and studied, he points out.

But often the problem is on a much simpler level, says Dr Matthew Carrano, curator of Dinosauria at The Smithsonian in Washington - that new discoveries may just be missed altogether.

With the rate of dinosaur discoveries showing no sign of slowing, he says a private find may slip under the radar as ""there's no catalogue or account of them aside from the occasional high-profile example that might make the news.

""The rest are sold and bought without any publicity and just disappear into private hands, often without science knowing they exist.""",What's wrong with buying a dinosaur?,science and technology,scientific institution,1027

The damage could even extend to humans, experts say, having a ‘serious impact’ on mankind by changing our environment.

Chemicals in plastic from carrier bags, microbeads in cosmetics and synthetic fibres from clothing can irritate the creatures’ digestive systems.

They may cause damage to their gut and make it more difficult to absorb nutrients or eat properly, which can stunt their growth or make them lose weight.

Or plastics can physically clog up their bodies to make it harder for them to eat at all, researchers from Anglia Ruskin University said.

1980,abcnews,"Authorities are trying to determine if anyone helped two inmates who escaped from a California jail, traveled hundreds of miles and crossed into Mexico before being captured trying to walk back into the United States.

Jonathan Salazar, 20, and Santos Fonseca, 21, were arrested by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials at a port of entry in San Ysidro — the nation's largest border crossing — early Wednesday, Monterey County Sheriff's Office Capt. John Thornburg said.

Thornburg said the two are in the custody of Monterey County officials and have been returned to a jail in Salinas, a farming city of about 160,000 people roughly 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of San Francisco.

Salazar and Fonseca escaped Sunday from the lockup in Salinas after climbing through a hole they made in the ceiling of a bathroom, squeezing through a hollow wall and kicking open a hatch. Officials found their jail-issued jumpsuits outside the building. Inmates often wear their own clothes under the jumpsuits, Thornburg said.

Investigators have not yet determined how long they worked on making the hole or if anyone else helped them escape or helped them after they were out. They were reported missing at 8:15 a.m. Sunday.

Thornburg said authorities received a tip that the pair, both born and raised in Salinas, had been spotted in the Mexican border city of Tijuana, around 400 miles (644 kilometers) south of Monterey County, and alerted federal officials.

CBP spokeswoman Jackie Wasiluk said the men didn't present any documents. They said they were U.S. citizens, and a check of law enforcement databases told border inspectors that they were wanted by authorities.

How the pair made it to Mexico, why they decided to travel together since they allegedly belong to rival gangs and why they returned to the United States is under investigation, Thornburg said.

""The good news here is they are in custody again,"" Thornburg said.

Salazar and Fonseca will be housed separately in a different housing unit from the one they escaped, Thornburg said, adding that officials had already made security improvements to the jail. He said he couldn't provide details.

Before being spotted in Tijuana, investigators received a credible tip from an employee at a motel in Marina about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the jail who told authorities Salazar had checked in there Tuesday morning, but authorities found no one in the room after a nearly eight-hour standoff, Thornburg said.

""It all looked like we had Mr. Salazar in a motel,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, last night he wasn't there.""

Both had been in custody since 2018 and were awaiting trial on murder counts and ""numerous other felony charges"" in separate cases.

Salazar was arrested in the shooting death of 20-year-old Jaime Martinez as the victim drove in Salinas with his girlfriend and 18-month-old son. The woman was shot and treated at a hospital, while the child wasn't hurt.

Police investigated the Oct. 12, 2017, shooting as gang-related. Officers said his tattoos, including the letter P on his cheek, refer to his Sureño offshoot gang, La Posada Trece, the Californian reported. His trial was scheduled to begin in January.

Fonseca told police after his arrest on homicide charges that his gang leader told him to kill someone to prove he was still loyal to the Boronda Boys, a subset of the Norteño gang, Detective Gabriela Contreras testified.

Fonseca is charged with shooting Lorenzo Gomez Acosta, 37, to death on June 2, 2018, while the victim sat in his car on a video call with his wife in Mexico, the Californian reported.

She saw a scuffle, heard her husband screaming ""no"" and then gunshots rang out, Salinas police Officer Froylan Aranda said. Acosta was reportedly chosen at random.

Three days later, Fonseca shot and killed Ernesto Garcia Cruz, 27, in a Salinas park, authorities said. He told police that the gang leader also ordered the slaying and that he picked his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend ""to send him a message,"" Contreras said.

On March 6, 2019, Jerry Pasternak, Vice Chair of AMLA, submitted an application to the City for the High Level Bridge to be lit up on May 9, 2019 in the colours of pink, blue, and white to recognize the March for Life. For over 10 years, thousands of supporters have participated in the annual peaceful outdoor march, organized by AMLA to recognize the dignity of the elderly and disabled people, as well as the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death.

AMLA's application was approved by the City on March 7, 2019. However, on April 5, the City reneged and cancelled the scheduled lighting of the Bridge. In an email, City staff stated: ""Upon further review of your application, it came to our attention that lighting the bridge for this event cannot be approved due to the polarizing nature of the subject matter.""

In response, Jerry Pasternak emailed City staff, stating: ""I am deeply disappointed in your decision. Can you please provide evidence of this polarization?""

The City of Edmonton has not responded.

A nearly identical incident occurred May 7, 2017, when, on the day the Bridge was approved to be lit in the pink, blue and white colours associated with the March for Life, the City cancelled the lighting. No rationale or justification was provided by the City for the cancellation.

The Bridge is regularly lit in association with various religious and political causes, awareness days, religious celebrations, political holidays and commemorations that promote the ideologies, political causes and religious beliefs of their proponents. For example, within the last three years, the Bridge has repeatedly been lit to promote sexual and gender diversity, Pride, various Islamic holidays and commemorations, Jewish religious holidays, Buddhist religious holidays, days recognizing political events in foreign countries such as Chilean Independence Day and the anniversary of the founding of Azerbaijan, and awareness days such as National Day of Remembrance for Victims of Terrorism, and Wrongful Conviction Day. Ironically recognizing beliefs and causes that are similar to the Alberta March for Life Association, the Bridge has recently been lit in association with International Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Day, and various disability awareness campaigns.

As outlined in the Justice Centre's court application, the City is constitutionally prohibited from discriminating against the content of expression in spaces it has opened up to the public for expressive purposes. In twice deciding to cancel a scheduled lighting of the Bridge, exclusively because of the pro-life expression involved, the City has twice failed to explain how such expression is ""polarizing"", or whether it is more ""polarizing"" than other causes, or how the City determines which organizations or issues are sufficiently ""polarizing"" to warrant being denied the right to use a public space that is available to a long list of other causes.

""The City of Edmonton is home to a diverse population with a wide variety of views, values and beliefs including, unsurprisingly, persons who express pro-life views. As a government that is constitutionally obligated to be neutral regarding the expression of its citizens, it is not the proper role of the City to elevate and promote the favoured ideological causes of some citizens to the exclusion of the lawful views of others,"" stated Justice Centre staff lawyer James Kitchen.

""The City ought to cease permitting citizens to use the High Level Bridge lighting system to promote their pet causes, as the City of Prince Albert did with its community flagpole"" continued Kitchen. ""However, if the City chooses to continue with this practice, it must cease arbitrarily playing favourites with who can have the bridge lit up in colours representing a particular political cause, ideology, or religion.""

384119,npr,"It is not easy to be married to a person in the military. Their spouses in 2017 experienced high levels of stress, anxiety, depression and unemployment, according to a survey sponsored by the Department of Defense and released Thursday.

The survey reveals a huge swath of nearly a million partners of active duty and reserve troops faced a variety of challenges due to their spouses' service while deployed on active duty or following a move triggered by a new deployment.

Of 367,706 people married to reservists, 92 percent reported feeling an increase in stress levels during their spouse's deployment, while 85 percent said they felt anxious or depressed. It also triggered feelings of isolation — 88 percent said they experienced loneliness.

Overall rates of marriage for military members generally match national rate — about 50 percent — although, active duty members seem to legally pair off in greater numbers than reserve members.

Still, the report finds female military members, who made up 16 percent of the active-duty force and 20 percent of the Selected Reserve, were less likely to be married than their male counterparts. They were about twice as likely to get divorced.

Dual-military marriages — service members married to other service members — accounted for 6.6 percent of all married couples.

The survey found the unemployment rate for active-duty spouses was exponentially higher in 2017 than the national average at the time. Nearly a quarter of the 612,127 active-duty spouses said they were unemployed, a far greater percentage than Americans outside the military. The unemployment rate for civilian men and women 20 years old and older dropped from 4.4 to 3.7 percent.

Additionally, those who had been forced to move due to a spouse's new deployment, were twice as likely to be unemployed. Finding a job often took seven months or more after a relocation, the survey found.

Unemployment rates among reservists' spouses appear to be much lower, comparatively, though at 8 percent it is still twice as high as nationwide statistics.

It's also unusually high considering more than half of reservists' spouses have a bachelor's degree or higher. The national unemployment rate for the same group hovered between 2 to 2.5 percent throughout 2017.","Military Families Experience High Stress, Anxiety And Unemployment, Report Says",labour,unemployment,358
289868,lifesitenews,"October 8, 2019 (The Catholic Thing) — The Church, in her long history, has never been confronted with the situation like the one in which she now finds herself. Pope Francis recently spoke of a possible schism within the Church, a schism that does not frighten him. We have had many schisms in the past, he says, and there will be schisms in the future. So, there is nothing to fear in the present. However, it is the nature of the present possible schism that is new, and this unprecedented new schism is frightening.

One cannot help but think that Francis is referring to members of the Church in the United States. Francis receives, from America, his most theologically challenging and pastorally concerned criticism, which centers on a questionable remaking of the faith and of the Church. Such censure, it is believed by Francis's cohort, originates from within a conservative intellectual elite who are politically motivated, and many of whom are wealthy.

Francis thinks that they are unwilling to change, and so refuse to accept the new work of the Spirit in our day. Ultimately, one discerns that he believes his critics are psychologically and emotionally impaired, and so must be dealt with gently (though that gentleness is yet to be experienced by those who fall under his vindictive abuse). He himself has called those who oppose him many insulting names.

What Francis does not realize (and his close associates fail to grasp) is that the overwhelming majority of his American critics would never initiate a schism. They recognize that he is the pope and thus the successor of Peter, and that to remain within the Catholic Church is to remain faithful to the pope, even if it entails being critical of the pope in one's faithfulness to him.

Some may wish that an actual schism will take place in America in order to get rid of the obdurate conservative element and so demonstrate that they were not really Catholic all along. But that is not going to happen, because those critical bishops, priests, theologians, commentators, and laity (more laity than Francis will admit) know that what they believe and uphold is in accord with Scripture, the Church councils, the ever-living magisterium, and the saints.

As has been often noted, Pope Francis and his cohort never engage in theological dialogue, despite their constant claim that such dialogue is necessary. The reason is that they know they cannot win on that front. Thus, they are forced to resort to name-calling, psychological intimidation, and sheer will-to-power.

Now, as many commentators have already pointed out, the German church is more likely to go into schism. The German bishops are proposing a two-year ""binding"" synod that, if what is proposed is enacted, would introduce beliefs and practices contrary to the universal tradition of the Church.

I believe, however, that such a German schism will not formally happen either, for two reasons. First, many within the German hierarchy know that by becoming schismatic they would lose their Catholic voice and identity. This they cannot afford. They need to be in fellowship with Pope Francis, for he is the very one who has fostered a notion of synodality that they are now attempting to implement. He, therefore, is their ultimate protector.

Second, while Pope Francis may stop them from doing something egregiously contrary to the Church's teaching, he will allow them to do things that are ambiguously contrary, for such ambiguous teaching and pastoral practice would be in accord with Francis' own. It is in this that the Church finds herself in a situation that she never expected.

It's important to bear in mind that the German situation must be viewed within a broader context: the theological ambiguity within Amoris Laetitia; the not so subtle advancing of the homosexual agenda; the ""re-foundation"" of the (Roman) John Paul II Institute on Marriage and Family, i.e., the undermining of the Church's consistent teaching on moral and sacramental absolutes, especially with regard to the indissolubility of marriage, homosexuality, contraception, and abortion.

Similarly, there is the Abu Dhabi statement, which directly contradicts the will of the Father and so undermines the primacy of Jesus Christ his Son as the definitive Lord and universal Savior.

Moreover, the present Amazon Synod is teeming with participants sympathetic to and supportive of all of the above. One must likewise take into account the many theologically dubious cardinals, bishops, priests, and theologians whom Francis supports and promotes to high ecclesial positions.

With all of this in mind, we perceive a situation, ever-growing in intensity, in which on the one hand, a majority of the world's faithful — clergy and laity alike — are loyal and faithful to the pope, for he is their pontiff, while critical of his pontificate, and, on the other hand, a large contingent of the world's faithful — clergy and laity alike — enthusiastically support Francis precisely because he allows and fosters their ambiguous teaching and ecclesial practice.

What the Church will end up with, then, is a pope who is the pope of the Catholic Church and, simultaneously, the de facto leader, for all practical purposes, of a schismatic church. Because he is the head of both, the appearance of one church remains, while in fact there are two.

The only phrase that I can find to describe this situation is ""internal papal schism,"" for the pope, even as pope, will effectively be the leader of a segment of the Church that through its doctrine, moral teaching, and ecclesial structure, is for all practical purposes schismatic. This is the real schism that is in our midst and must be faced, but I do not believe Pope Francis is in any way afraid of this schism. As long as he is in control, he will, I fear, welcome it, for he sees the schismatic element as the new ""paradigm"" for the future Church.

Thus, in fear and trembling, we need to pray that Jesus, as the head of His body, the Church, will deliver us from this trial. Then again, he may want us to endure it, for it may be that only by enduring it can the Church be freed from all the sin and corruption that now lies within her, and be made holy and pure.

On a more hopeful note, I believe it will be the laity who bring about the needed purification. Pope Francis has himself stated that this is the age of the laity. Lay people see themselves as helpless, having no ecclesial power. Yet if the laity raise their voices, they will be heard.

More specifically, I believe it will depend mostly on faithful and courageous Catholic women. They are the living icons of the Church, the bride of Christ, and they, in union with Mary, the Mother of God and the Mother of the Church, will birth anew, in the Holy Spirit, a holy Body of Christ.

171299,eveningstandard,"When you think about artificial intelligence (AI) you probably first think about self-driving cars and robots. However AI already plays a central part in our lives.

From film choices on Netflix to spam filters on Gmail, we already interact with AI on a daily basis. Over the coming years, the role of AI in our lives – particularly in healthcare, education and security – is likely to dramatically change.

""Many of these will save us time or allow us to do what we currently do more effectively,"" said Harry Rhys Davies, AI Programme Lead at entrepreneur network Tech Nation.

Last month at the State of AI 2019 conference at the Royal Institute in London it was revealed that the UK is leading the AI health and well-being sector. One in three European health start-ups are currently founded in the UK.

""We anticipate that the adoption of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare will help ordinary people by reducing the cost of diagnosing illness and increasing preventative healthcare,"" said Vasile Foca, Managing Partner and Co-Founder at investment firm Talis Capital which backs emerging technologies.

Doctors are likely to have access to tools that mean they can deliver highly accurate diagnostics.

""AI makes it possible to crunch data from huge sample sizes and that should help scientists to identify the causes of various diseases, including cancer, and from there find appropriate treatments.""

There are some things AI is getting better at than humans, says Lydia Nicholas, a programme manager from think tank Doteveryone. ""It can tell when we are lying, can tell a real smile from a fake one; can even tell more accurately than a human can which fake smile masks clinical depression and which ones are just because you aren’t in the mood,"" she said.

However, Ms Nicholas believes we need to be careful not to rely on systems that are not yet reliable. ""When we do use automated systems for critical decisions the failure rate can be shocking,"" she said.

""Algorithms shape almost everything we see online; the next video to watch, the products and jobs we’re advertised, the order of news articles or social media posts we read. In doing so, they change how we understand the world,"" said Ms Nicholas. This means they also cater to the prejudices of their creators.

Last year Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of Buckingham University and ex-head of Wellington College said that AI could teach pupils ""better than ever"". He said it could end ""inefficient"" group learning and mean teachers have more time for active one-to-one lessons.

He described the advent of AI in the classroom as “the biggest move in education for 300 years”. Sir Anthony said personalised learning means things can happen much more quickly, leaving teachers to lead group and project work.

Mr Foca also believes education will be a big benefactor of AI.

""Lots of startups are focusing on low-income populations who may not be able to afford to go to university, but can pay to learn online,"" he said.

Fraud detection is likely to get more sophisticated in the coming years. ""In the security and cyber security worlds, AI is being used to process millions of videos and photo images to help spot bad actors/ criminals,"" said Mr Foca.

""While law firms and prosecutors are using AI to process data points in evidence statements, which helps take a lot of data processing and potential errors out of building a prosecution case.""

However, these advances won't come with their own problems. For example, according to a report by Big Brother Watch last year the Metropolitan Police's facial recognition technology is still 98% inaccurate.

""We still have fundamental questions to ask ourselves and these will only become more pervasive,"" warned Mr Rhys Davies.

""Already we see that algorithms can perpetuate bias and social injustice where the datasets that AI learn from can often exclude minority groups. Issues of privacy are particularly potent as facial recognition gains ground.""

Ms Nicholas said: ""What will shape our lives is not specifics of what AI can do but how it is used, and what protections we can get, both as individuals and as a society.""","How AI could change healthcare, education and security",education,social learning,657

This year, Birmingham and the Black Country has experienced blood-shed brutality of the highest order.

BirminghamLive has collated a list of homicides throughout 2018, from cold-hearted murders and manslaughters to self-defence killings and road incidents.

We have reported on 58 killings and, of those, the highest number of homicides were recorded just last month (December, 10).

Overall, that's almost five EVERY month or at least one person killed PER WEEK.

Chief Inspector Edward Foster, from the force’s Homicide Unit, said: “We saw an unprecedented number of murders in 2018, many involving young people as both perpetrators and victims, and each one received a full and thorough investigation.

“We also saw an increase in the complexity of the cases and to manage this increased demand on our Homicide team, extra officers have been seconded to the department to support them.

“The team endeavour to provide the best evidence possible to the court so that a jury can reach their decision.

“We have made no secret of the fact that our resources are stretched, but we are continuing our prevention and intervention activity as well as looking at measures to streamline and improve our services to the public.""

West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, David Jamieson, said: ""Violent crime is an issue that naturally worries us all.

""West Midlands Police has been on the front foot and has ensured hundreds of very dangerous people are locked up.""

He added: ""It's well documented that violent crime is committed more frequently than it was a few years ago.

""This year it has jumped by a fifth. Knife crime rose by 17 per cent and we have had a total of 20 fatal stabbings this year.

""Gun crime has risen by seven per cent with seven people being shot and killed since January.

""As crime rises we feel the stretch on resources more acutely.

""We currently face these pressures as our spending power continues to shrink. Since 2010, we've lost £175 million and more than 2,000 officers.""

On Tuesday morning, Hastings saw 13mm (0.5in) of rain fall in one hour, while 10mm (0.4in) was recorded at Sandhurst, the Met Office said.

A yellow thunderstorm warning covering central and eastern England and a yellow rain warning covering North Wales and north-west England are in place until midday.

In Birmingham, heavy, thundery rain at first is expected from the Met Office, with forecasters issuing its daily forecast for Tuesday.

This is set to be slowly easing but remaining cloudy and murky with further outbreaks of light rain in places.

A few bright spells may develop in the southwest and far north of the region later.

""Feeling warm and humid,"" the Met Office say.

Tonight, any residual rain and drizzle will ease, to leave a dry night although most will stay cloudy and murky.

Forecasters warned of ""challenging"" conditions for the morning commute, with a risk of localised flooding and surface water on roads posing a hazard to motorists.

Met Office meteorologist Simon Partridge said: ""The storms have arrived along the south coast of England from the Isle of Wight to the Dove Strait with increasing amounts of thundery activity.

""Those storms are expected to clear by the time we get to 7am, leaving some light rain for an hour or so before it gets drier through the morning.

""The storms will continue north-eastwards over parts of East Anglia and the Humber before edging out over the North Sea.

""There could be some localised flooding, but certainly some surface water flooding which can cause problems to drive through as well as spray.

""So the early morning commute could be challenging, especially in areas north of London as that's where the heaviest rain will be at that point.""

As well as problems on the roads, passengers using some southern routes have been advised to check for potential disruption to journeys.

National Rail Enquiries said passengers on Gatwick Express, Great Northern, Southern and Thameslink services could be affected.

The storms are being fed by an area of warm air that brought a muggy night for many - with temperatures only falling to 20C (68F) in some parts of the South East.

The mercury is expected to climb quickly after the lively weather moves through, with up to 27C (80F) expected in parts of the south on Tuesday afternoon.

1672,abcnews,"On the picket lines at a General Motors transmission plant in Toledo, Ohio, passing cars honked and striking workers celebrated a tentative contract deal by munching on 10 pizzas dropped off by a supporter.

They had carried signs for 31 days and demonstrated the muscle the United Auto Workers union still has over Detroit's three manufacturers.

Details of the four-year pact weren't released, but GM's latest offer to end the monthlong strike included wage increases and lump-sum payments, top-notch health insurance at little cost to workers, promises of new products for many U.S. factories and a path to full-time work for temporary workers.

That's a big difference from what GM wanted going into the talks: to slash total labor costs at its factories, which are about $13 per hour higher than at foreign automakers in the U.S.

Terry Dittes, the UAW's chief bargainer with GM, said the deal offers ""major gains"" for 49,000 union workers who have been walking picket lines since Sept. 16. They'll stay off work for at least a couple more days while union committees decide if they will bless the deal. Then workers will have to vote on it.

The deal shows that the union, with less than one-third of the 1.5 million members it had at its peak in 1979, still has a lot of clout with GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler.

""I think economically the UAW will do just fine in this agreement,"" said Art Schwartz, a former GM negotiator who now is a labor consultant in Michigan. ""The union certainly still has power in this industry.""

President Donald Trump called UAW President Gary Jones on Wednesday night, but union spokesman Brian Rothenberg said he did not know what the men discussed.

The strike immediately brought GM's U.S. factories to a halt, and within a week, started to hamper production in Mexico and Canada. Analysts at KeyBanc investment services estimated the stoppage cut GM vehicle production by 250,000 to 300,000 vehicles. That's too much for the company to make up with overtime or increased assembly line speeds. Analysts say the costs to GM will hit around $2 billion.

Workers, on the other hand, lost north of $3,000 each on average, the difference between their base wages and $250 per week in strike pay from the union.

""It's nice to see there's a deal, but without knowing the details I'm a little skeptical because we don't know the highlights or the lowlights,"" said worker Nick Kuhlman, who was among the strikers huddled around a burn barrel on a blustery, gray Toledo afternoon.

""I just hope it gets done,"" said Toledo worker Mark Nichols, who thought the strike would last only a week or two and was ready to get back to work because his savings are running low.

GM apparently was able to close three of four factories that it wanted to shutter to get rid of excess capacity in slow-selling cars and components. The Detroit-Hamtramck plant will get a new electric pickup truck and stay open, but factories in Lordstown, Ohio; Warren, Michigan; and near Baltimore are to be closed. The Lordstown area will get an electric vehicle battery factory, but it won't have nearly as many workers as the assembly plant that for years made compact GM cars.

The deal now will be used as a template for talks with GM's crosstown rivals, Ford and Fiat Chrysler. Normally the major provisions carry over to the other two companies and cover about 140,000 auto workers nationwide. It wasn't clear which company the union would bargain with next, or whether there would be another strike.

Schwartz said depending on the contents, the GM contract could influence wages and benefits in other industries. But he said foreign automakers with U.S. factories, mainly in the South, will give modest pay raises regardless of the GM contract, and shouldn't be affected much.

Clarence Trinity, a worker at GM's engine and transmission plant in the Detroit suburb of Romulus, Michigan, said the deal sounds good, ""but I have to see it in writing or hear from the leaders.""

Trinity said he can't figure out why it took 31 days for the strike to end. ""I don't understand what General Motors was expecting to get out of us. Maybe they didn't expect us to strike. Maybe they didn't expect us to strike this long.""

If all of the committees bless the deal, it's likely to take several days for GM to get its factories restarted.

Matt Himes, a worker at the GM plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, heard news of the deal in Ohio, where he's trying to help his wife sell their house after the Lordstown GM plant where he used to work was shuttered.

He hopes good news keeps coming. If they can sell their house, his wife can finally move south with him.

""I'm proud that we stuck our ground and everybody stuck together,"" Himes said of the union workers during a phone interview. ""And I'm relieved that hopefully it worked out, got us a good contract and we can move on and get back to work making cars like we should be.""

Wall Street investors liked news that the strike could end. GM shares jumped 2.6% just after the news broke, but eased back to close up 1% at $36.65.

GM and the union have been negotiating at a time of troubling uncertainty for the U.S. auto industry. Driven up by the longest economic expansion in American history, auto sales appear to have peaked and are now heading in the other direction. GM and other carmakers are also struggling to make the transition to electric and autonomous vehicles.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump's trade war with China and his tariffs on imported steel and aluminum have raised costs for auto companies. A revamped North American free trade deal is stalled in Congress, raising doubts about the future of America's trade in autos and auto parts with Canada and Mexico, which last year came to $257 billion.

Amid that uncertainty, GM workers have wanted to lock in as much as they can before things get ugly. They argue that they had given up pay raises and made other concessions to keep GM afloat during its 2009 trip through bankruptcy protection. Now that GM has been nursed back to health — earning $2.42 billion in its latest quarter — they wanted a bigger share.

The union's bargainers have voted to recommend the deal to the UAW International Executive Board, which will vote on the agreement. Union leaders from factories nationwide will travel to Detroit for a vote on Thursday. The earliest workers could return would be after that.

In past years, it's taken a minimum of three or four days and as long as several weeks for the national ratification vote.

This time around — with a federal corruption investigation that has implicated the past two UAW presidents and brought convictions of five union officials — many union members don't trust the leadership. But they're also tired of striking and may return before they vote on the deal themselves.

The strike had shut down 33 GM manufacturing plants in nine states across the U.S., and also took down factories in Canada and Mexico. It was the first national strike by the union since a two-day walkout in 2007, and the longest since a 54-day strike in Flint, Michigan, in 1998 that also halted most of GM's production.

Netanyahu, speaking at a security cabinet meeting on Sunday, directed military leaders to reinforce tanks, artillery and infantry forces around the Gaza Strip.

“​​Hamas bears responsibility not only for its own attacks and actions but also those by Islamic Jihad, for which it pays a very high price,” ​said Netanyahu, who also serves as defense minister.

Militant groups in Gaza have launched at least 600 rockets and mortars at towns and villages in southern Israel since Friday, Israel’s military said, noting that its Iron Dome anti-missile system has intercepted more than 150 of them.

In retaliation, Israel has pounded more than 260 targets belonging to Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants in the Gaza Strip.

Officials in Gaza said 16 people, including five civilians, have been killed in the bombardment since Friday.

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the introduction of the programme “will reduce the number of people who contract HIV in future”.

The full PrEP treatment (pre-exposure prophylaxis) will involve the pre-emptive use of antiretroviral medication and regular monitoring and testing, as well as advice and counselling on safer sex practices.

A health technology assessment of the drug by the Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) found PrEP is safe and highly effective at preventing HIV in people at substantial risk, and also found the introduction of a PrEP programme would be cost-saving.

Several LGBTQ+ organisations had campaigned for the medication to be available through the public health service in recent years.

“PrEP is just one element of our response to reducing HIV rates; we’ve also prioritised increasing awareness and HIV testing,” Mr Varadkar said.

Minister for Health Simon Harris said the introduction of the programme was a “really important milestone”, and that PrEP would “save lives”.

“For decades we have confined conversations about HIV to the shadows. Those living with HIV have felt stigmatised and shamed; today, all that changes,” he said on Thursday.

The programme will initially be available in a number of hospitals, including the STI Guide Clinic in St James’s Hospital, St Vincent’s University Hospital, Cork University Hospital, University Hospital Galway, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, and Midlands Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.

Dr Fiona Lyons, consultant in HIV medicine at the St James’s Hospital STI clinic, welcomed access to the medication “without charge to those who are at substantial risk of acquiring HIV through sexual contact”.

Dr Lyons said PrEP was an “important part of the HIV prevention jigsaw puzzle” which should reduce the number of new infections.

In recent years the rate of new HIV diagnoses has increased in Ireland. In 2018 there was 531 new cases recorded, an 8 per cent increase on the previous year, according to figures from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.

Male-to-male sexual transmission accounts for more than half of cases, and an estimated 7,000 people are living with HIV in Ireland.

336004,naturalnews,"(Natural News) If you have gout, you know how painful it can be. The condition is characterized by painful inflammation in the joints, resulting in swelling and redness. Gout it caused by a build-up of uric acid, which leads to the depositing of hard crystals in the joints and ultimately, pain. Fortunately, there are many natural approaches to treating and managing gout. Cherries are one of the most popular natural gout remedies, but there are plenty of other options to consider. Apple cider vinegar (ACV) has an array of medicinal uses — including treating and preventing gout.

Among natural health enthusiasts, apple cider vinegar is easily the most popular vinegar. Many of ACV’s purported health benefits are backed by science, including its ability to promote weight loss, reduce inflammation and lower blood sugar levels.

Apple cider vinegar is a great choice for fighting gout for two reasons: It can help treat gout symptoms after they’ve started, and help prevent a gout flare-up from starting in the first place.

As Foods For Better Health reports, the acetic acid found in ACV helps to alkalize the body and “cleanse” the blood. Acetic acid also works with malic acid and pectin to eliminate acidic toxins from the body. Essentially, these compounds found in ACV work to fight the accumulation of uric acid in the blood, and help remove it from the body entirely.

While there is not much scientific research on the benefits of ACV in the treatment of gout, it has remained a staple in traditional medicine for years. More, research exploring other areas of ACV benefits can be very telling.

As Healthline reports, scientific studies have shown that ACV helps reduce inflammation and promote weight loss — two things that can help reduce your risk of a gout flare-up.

More importantly, however, it appears that ACV can help your body eliminate uric acid effectively. Japanese researchers also recently found that acidity in the body can interfere with the elimination of uric acid. The team found that urine that is less acidic (more alkaline) carries more uric acid out of the body.

For people with gout, this is big news because ACV is proven to help alkalize bodily fluids.

To conduct their research, the team asked participants to follow an acidic or alkaline diet. The alkaline diet group had more alkaline urine, which carried out more uric acid than the acidic group. Vinegar was a key component of the alkaline diet, though not the only food prescribed.

Foods For Better Health suggests that ACV can be used topically and internally for gout. To use topically, just soak a cotton ball in ACV, apply to the affected joint and gently massage. Sources suggest that one to two tablespoons of ACV can be mixed with one cup of water and consumed up to three times a day for gout relief. Honey or another sweetener of choice can be used to help make the concoction more palatable. It is recommended that ACV supplements be taken either at night before bed or before meals.

You can also combine ACV and your favorite oil to make your own healing salad dressing.

While ACV has many health benefits, it is very acidic and should be diluted before consuming. It is also important to only take ACV in moderation. Too much or too strong a concoction can damage tooth enamel or even burn the esophagus.

500156,sottnet,"When you approach the world scientifically, you seek to gain knowledge about how it works by asking it questions about itself. You observe its behavior; you perform experiments on it; you measure specific quantities that you're interested in. If you ask the right questions in the right ways, you can begin to gain information about what physical phenomena govern the behavior that was revealed in each and every one of your investigations.Most of the time, your results will teach you something specific about the Universe. But every once in a while, you'll find something that seems too good to be true. You'll measure something that will confuse you in one of two ways:. This is known as fine-tuning, and it really is a problem in physics.You don't even need to look at physics to understand why this would be the case. Imagine, instead, you were looking at the net worths of some of the richest people in the world, as based on the Forbes Billionaires list . If you were to pick two of them at random, what would you expect to find? Sure, you'd expect that each one would be worth at least one billion dollars, but you'd also expect there would be a large difference between these two values.If the first billionaire is worth an amount A, and the second is worth an amount B, then the difference between them is C, where A - B = C. Without any further knowledge, you should be able to assume something about C: it shouldn't be much smaller than either A or B. In other words, if A and B are both in the billions of dollars, then it's likely that C will be in (or close to) a value of billions as well.For example, A might be Pat Stryker (#703 on the list), worth, let's say, $3,592,327,960. And B might be David Geffen (#190), worth $8,467,103,235. The difference between them, or A - B, is then -$4,874,775,275. C has a 50/50 shot of being positive or negative, but in most cases, it's going to be of the same order of magnitude (within a factor of 10 or so) of both A and B.But it won't always be. For example, most of the over 2,200 billionaires in the world are worth less than $2 billion, and there are hundreds worth between $1 billion and $1.2 billion. If you happened to pick two of them at random, it wouldn't surprise you terribly if the difference in their net worth was only a few tens of millions of dollars.It might, however, surprise you if the difference between them was only a few thousand dollars, or was zero. ""How unlikely,"" you'd think. But it might not be all that unlikely after all.After all, you don't know which billionaires were on your list. Would you be shocked to learn the Winklevoss twins - Cameron and Tyler, the first Bitcoin billionaires - had identical net worths? Or that the Collison brothers, Patrick and John (co-founders of Stripe), had net worths that differed by only a few hundred dollars?No, it wouldn't be particularly surprising. In general if A is large and B is large, then A - B will also be large,. The distribution of billionaires isn't completely random, as there might be underlying reasons for two seemingly unrelated values to actually be related. (In the case of the net worths of the Winklevosses or the Collisons, there's literally a blood relationship!)In the Universe, there are many things that are finely-tuned. The expanding Universe itself is a fantastic example. At the earliest moment of the hot Big Bang, the fabric of space itself was expanding at a particular rate (the Hubble expansion rate) that happened to be enormous. At the same time, the Universe was filled with a tremendous amount of energy in the form of particles, antiparticles, and radiation.The expanding Universe is basically a race between these two competing forces:with the Big Bang serving as the starting gun. Interestingly enough, in order to wind up with the Universe we have today,This puzzle is known as the flatness problem, as a Universe where energy and the expansion rate balance so perfectly will also be perfectly spatially flat. We can also, today, measure the curvature of the Universe by a number of different methods, such as by examining the patterns of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background.By comparing the observations we make with our theoretical predictions for what those fluctuations should look like in a Universe with varying amounts of curvature, we can determine that, even today. If we extrapolate back to the earliest stages of the hot Big Bang based on our modern observations, we learn that the initial expansion rate and the initial energy densityWhen we're faced with a puzzle like this, we have two options for how we proceed.After all, there are many coincidences that we observe today where two things appear closely related because they were set up, long ago, with the right conditions that would lead them to appear related today.Venus, for example, orbits the Sun in an elliptical shape, similar to how all the planets orbit. But Venus has the smallest percent difference between its closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) and when it reaches its farthest distance from the sun (aphelion) of any of the planets.Why is Venus more circular, and less elliptical, than any of the other planets? It's simply due to the initial conditions of the material that gave rise to the Solar System. Neptune is the second most circular, followed by Earth. The least circular planet? Mercury, followed by Mars and then Saturn. There wasn't a mechanism that caused these eccentricities; it had the outcome we observe today because of the (seemingly random) initial conditions our Solar System was born with.But this is, because it assumes that there isn't an underlying cause that gave rise to the effect we observe. The alternative option is to assume that there was somethat gave rise to the apparent fine-tuning we see today.For example, if you take a look at an enormous rock balanced precariously on a perch, you would assume that something caused it to be that way.Fine-tuning doesn'tto imply a fine-tuner, but rather that there was a physical mechanism underlying why something appears finely-tuned today. The effect may look like an unlikely coincidence, but thisbe the case if there's a cause responsible for the effect we see.Going back to the case of the flatness problem, it's easy to theorize some potential explanations for what would cause the Universe to appear flat today. It's possible that the initial expansion rate and the initial energy density of the Universe arose from the same pre-existing state, causing these two value to be related and balanced.It's also possible that a phase of the Universe existed before the Big Bang, expanding rapidly and stretching the Universe so that it's indistinguishable from perfectly flat. It's possible that the Universe really is curved, but that it's curved on a much larger scale than our observable Universe permits us to access, in the same way that you couldn't measure the curvature of Earth solely by examining your own backyard.The whole point of a fine-tuning argument isn't to declare that we have a weird coincidence, and therefore anything that explains this coincidence is likely to be right. Rather, it points us to the various ways we might think about an otherwise unexplained puzzle, to try and provide a physical explanation for a phenomenon that has no obvious cause.In science, our goal is to describe everything we observe or measure in the Universe through natural, physical explanations alone.When we see what appears to be a cosmic coincidence, we owe it to ourselves to examine every possible physical cause of that coincidence, as one of them might lead to the next great breakthrough.That doesn't mean you should credit (or blame) a particular theory or idea without further evidence, but the possible solutions we can theorize do tell us where it might be smart to look.As always, we have strict requirements for any such theory to be accepted, which includes reproducing all the successes of the previous leading theory, explaining these new puzzles, and also making new predictions about observable, measurable quantities that we can test. Until a new idea succeeds on all three fronts, it's only speculation. But that speculation is still incredibly valuable. If we don't engage in it, we've already given up on discovering new fundamental truths about our reality.",Fine-tuning in physics really is a problem,science and technology,natural science,1412
116395,collectiveevolution,"The basic idea of rehabilitation through imprisonment is that a person who has been incarcerated will never want to be sent back to prison after they have been set free. It is hoped that an inmate’s experiences while locked up will leave such a lasting impression that a former prisoner will do whatever it takes to avoid a second term. Unfortunately, research has consistently shown that time spent in prison does not successfully rehabilitate most inmates, and the majority of criminals return to a life of crime almost immediately. Many argue that most prisoners will actually learn new and better ways to commit crimes while they are locked up with their fellow convicts. They can also make connections and become more deeply involved in the criminal world. (source)

Ignorance is so convenient. But time’s up. We all have a choice to make, and hopefully, it will be an informed one.

Chances are we all probably fall into one of two populations. One: thoughtful, compassionate, aware and self-aware, or two: thoughtless, selfish, unaware, and self-righteous.

So, where do criminals come from? When we believed slavery was proper, we believed some people were given to us to righteously use and abuse. Today, in its place we have what I call The Tulip Theory. When I was newly married about 35 years ago, my husband and I were into gardening and we sent away for 100 tulip bulbs from Holland, never mind that we lived in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles County or that climate change was yet to be considered.

The endeavor to garden was life-changing for me. The bulbs arrived. I opened the box and there, on top of 100 tulip bulbs, was a note: “The wonderful thing about these bulbs is you can’t go wrong. They don’t need any care. You don’t have to water them, feed them or put them into the ground. Whatever you do or don’t do, they will still blossom into beautiful blooms even if you leave them on a shelf in the dark.” I put down the piece of paper and said to my husband, “Oh, my God. I was raised on The Tulip Theory.”

Prisoners were raised on The Tulip Theory, and some of us look at them as though they were given to us to righteously despise or to give us the illusion of superiority, when we’re not doing so well, ourselves. Today, lots of us share the philosophy of the tulip farmers, even professors, attorneys, and doctors, who may end up raising unhappy children by setting expectations without nurturing and coaching their children into achievement with regular prompts such as, “I know you can do this.”

Some parents raise ‘timebombs’ and shooters, in part because we leave our babies in the hands of daycare providers or rotating neighbors and relatives – this can be very psychologically damaging for some children.  The economy requires a two-income household now, so it is easy to see why both parents do end up working.  Working during the formative first five years of our children’s lives used to be a choice. Now, not so much.

The very wealthy want even more money. What they have is never enough. The pharmaceutical industry, the insurance industry and the educational industry all want you to believe in The Tulip Theory aka take the side of Nature in the Nature vs. Nurture debate. You have been told that the jury is in and the scientific evidence supports genetic programming of personality.

When I was a young, new therapist, I didn’t believe it, but my clients did. They brought me articles about evidence that their personalities were inborn. They brought articles about the Scandinavian Studies, the Schizophrenic Studies, the Babies Separated at Birth Studies, and the Adoption Studies.

I was never a science major. That wasn’t my thing. However, it appeared to me I had no choice. So, for twenty-five years, more or less, I researched the research. I had to teach myself how to read a study because they were written so that few would ever understand them. I finally got it down, and I uncovered and listed about 20 techniques that scientists use repeatedly to get the results they are paid to get (Snyder, The Search for the Unholy Grail, 2016).

I listed these techniques so that anyone could read, assess and see through a behavioral study. The best-designed studies and research questions can be replicated. The worst cannot. The best studies represent childhood causes. The worst represent genetic alleged causality. Some scientists from the Human Genome Project admitted that finding such genetic instruction isn’t supported by research or the design of the human brain to include inborn behavioral programs, after all.

All this is to say the jury is in, whether you want to know it or not. Criminals are made, not born. Sometimes, even with good parenting, a community can be so saturated with survival behavior, a parent can’t win. Still, there are consequences to parenting choices. Most of us don’t know them. So, we depend upon The Tulip Theory. How we raise a child will determine how successful and praiseworthy they become or how damned they will be. There but for the grace of God go I, right?

Not convinced? In another book I wrote about how anyone—parent, judge, school counselor, therapist, forensic evaluator—could assess a childhood on a single sheet of paper, and within a 10% margin of error, predict forward a person’s aptitude for a successful life or not (Snyder, Predicting and Understanding Behavior According to Critical Childhood Experiences, 2016). The same measures can help us understand backward how a person became the way they are.

Criminals are made, not born. In this book I evaluate the childhoods of 25 famous people known for extreme behaviors, so the reader can see how their childhoods created who they became.

Columbine, Sandy Hook, El Paso, ad infinitum, all had killers who were predictable and understandable, yet we continue to wonder how a person could do such a horrible thing. In 1988, I spent about twenty hours interviewing The Night Stalker, Richard Ramirez, and realized that no one honors thy father and mother like a serial killer. I studied the childhood of Jeffrey Dahmer in depth only to discover he killed in order to keep from being left. As an infant, his mother wouldn’t touch him. Even after he was old enough to climb out of his crib, she pushed him away from her. I watched the Menendez Brothers trial from beginning to end and heard jurors say afterwards, “I was abused, and I didn’t grow up to kill my parents.”

We don’t understand cause and effect yet.

Over the years, I developed a formula of not only what critical childhood experiences it takes to turn out to be dangerous or amazing people but in what combinations and orders these events need to take place.

A violent person has to have had an insecure attachment, to have been physically abused, and probably emotionally shamed as well. They too have to have been raised in a family with a repression ethic, as the underground child, but they also have to have been raised within a family blame ethic versus a family self-reflection ethic. If all three of these factors are present, there will be violence. If one factor is missing, there will not be violence without provocation. Repeat: If a child has had a secure attachment, she will never have the drive to exploit or harm another person, even after a high dose of abuse.

Put another way, a secure attachment in the first five years of life makes a child not only immune to long-term effects of abuse, but just about guarantees resilience as well. I could go on, but that’s not what I came to tell you today. I came to talk about why people become criminals and what we can do about it, if we care to invest in the quality of human development.

Criminal behavior involves a legacy of abuse, like slavery, racism, devaluations, and survival, but it can also be linked to families who simply fail to form an attachment with their child, employ abusive discipline, judge and blame others, and then insist their child not complain.

To create a poverty-based criminal, start with an insecure attachment because most of these moms and dads have to work. Add issues of deprivation and chronic concerns of survival. Add emotional abuse, a blame ethic (versus a self-reflection ethic), and a repression ethic (versus an expression ethic). Depending upon the seriousness of the crime, some or all of these features will be formative in childhood.

Then, there are the adult ‘modifiers’. The adult child could run into a wonderful group of friends or a religious environment of ethics and character, or the adult child could hang with drug addicts or gang members that influence them in another direction.

Note that the way to create the majority of criminals comes from broken attachments, deprivation and a lack of parental investment, but the way to create some of the most brutal criminals in the world is to give them broken attachments, to not give the child a stable and constant parental figure, as well as to over-indulge them with an entitlement to exploit and abuse others. The most terrible people on the planet murder, torture, exploit and abuse others. They are our dictators. Supporting them are business people without scruples, who invest in the entitled exploitation of others.

How do you feel about punishment and retribution? Have you thought you would like to rub someone into the ground for their harmful choices? Have you ever asked, “How could someone do this?” That question reveals that one doesn’t yet consider that meanness comes from a different way of thinking born of a different set of experiences and history.

This has to be Awareness 101.

The language we use, the values we have, the understandings we reference are not inborn. We don’t know what we don’t know. And even if we had some peripheral exposure to ethics, we disregard them, because those ethics never protected us. As a matter of fact, it may enrage us that others get to have such pretty lives, and we didn’t. We believe what we experience.

We take as true what we are taught unless we are given permission to question. If you want a person to think differently or better, you have to ensure they have the wherewithal or freedom to think differently.

Would we be willing to rehabilitate them in a controlled environment rather than punish them? Of course, we need a multi-tiered program where people earn their ways into more privileged populations. The hardcore prisoners don’t get to go up to the next tier unless they soften.

Can we then grant them trauma therapy and classes on adulting and relationship skills? Can we grant them an education? Can we grant them an opportunity to have relationships?

Can we find pleasure in the satisfaction they discover from praise for a job well done? Would we grant them a permanent companion, a dog, who loves them and only them (given the dog is safe)? Would we allow them to enjoy playing tennis?

Would we grant them a television to watch the news or educational programming? Would we want them to have good books to read, especially literature and sociological studies? Would we grant them the right to vote if it makes them feel a part of the system to which they never thought they could belong?

What do you think about redemption?

Can we grant them another round to try to live a better life? If a person learns to think differently and comes to regret their bad and harmful choices, are we capable of forgiving them? Can we take our boot off their neck? Can we grant them some guarded faith that they can turn their lives around? Or, would we insist that they couldn’t possibly change and should therefore never be forgiven?

Can we give them the opportunities we had that they never had? Can we believe in them, or would we be the people who refuse to believe in redemption? Would we, then, be hypocrites?

How would we assess whether a person has changed or could change? Do we have criteria by which we evaluate whether or not a person has genuinely changed? Can we recognize true remorse? Can we credit humility? Can we look for different choices? Do we recognize the dangers of negative mirrors, wherein a person can never outgrow their reputation? Can we identify a healthy dialogue supported by virtuous values? Can we praise new choices and show appreciation?

Rather than holding them as people we self-righteously despise, we might find our own reward in helping them take the high road and consider that a person never chose their own fate but lived out only what they knew. If we give them new experiences, we might find that we are richer ourselves, and capable of investing in a world of better people. Our planet is down to the final challenges between the enlightened and the greedy.

476750,rt,"American billionaires have never had it so good – they’re actually paying a lower tax rate than the working class, according to two economists exposing the real beneficiaries of a system that has redistributed wealth to the top.

The 400 wealthiest families in the US paid a lower effective tax rate than working class families for the first time last year, economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California at Berkeley have claimed in their forthcoming book ‘The Triumph of Injustice’.

Billionaires, they say, were taxed at 23 percent, while working class families were taxed at 24.2 percent. Their calculations take into account state, local, and federal taxes, corporate taxes, and what the pair call “indirect taxes,” encompassing licenses and other fees paid to government.

While American income inequality was already considered to be at peak levels, Saez and Zucman cite the 2017 tax cuts that primarily benefited the rich and Big Business as the “tipping point” that has made the degree of inequality impossible to ignore – or allow to continue.

Decades of “trickle-down” economic policies, driven by economists who believed easing the tax burden on wealthy “job creators” would improve the fortunes of even the poorest citizens, have reduced the tax rate on the wealthiest Americans from 70 percent in 1950 to just over one-third of that.

The rich have seen not only their income tax rate lowered, but capital gains and estate taxes slashed by politicians looking to please their wealthy donors. Those who oppose a wealth tax on the principle that wealth redistribution smacks of socialism or excessive government interference must ignore the massive redistribution of wealth that has occurred over the last 70 years, as income for the middle and working class has plummeted and the rich have gotten significantly richer.

Saez and Zucman have called for a progressive tax, dramatically hiking the rate the wealthiest one percent pay and imposing a “minimum global corporate tax” to curtail the time-honored corporate practice of hiding wealth abroad.

Similar ideas are on the lips of Democratic presidential candidates, including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both of whom have proposed some form of “wealth tax.” And Americans under 30 are much more supportive of the idea of wealth redistribution than previous generations, having been brought up in the aftermath of Reaganomics.

After over half a century of widening inequality, the richest 85 people on the planet have as much as the poorest 3.5 billion, and the trickle-down supply-side economic model is widely considered a failure. Americans under 30, having had such a negative experience with neoliberal capitalism, view socialism much more favorably than their parents and previous generations.

During the Great Depression, faced with widespread poverty and a robust communist/socialist movement, then-President Franklin Delano Roosevelt passed the New Deal in order to “save” capitalism, reasoning that if the government did not provide some benefits to Americans, they would embrace socialism. One wonders if a 21st-century president would have the foresight to do the same.

Franciscan friar Father Daniel Horan, a pro-LGBT priest and professor who will be speaking at the upcoming Los Angeles Religious Education Congress, took to Twitter this weekend to bash the March for Life and condemn without trial a group of white Catholic high school boys as “racists” for supposedly “taunting” a Native American man beating a drum.

Father Horan was one of the many voices from the Catholic Left who joined the mainstream media lynching of students from Covington Catholic High School this weekend, rashly judging them as racists without bothering to ascertain what actually happened, simply because some of the boys were wearing MAGA hats.

While the Jesuit-run America magazine claimed that a small group of Native American demonstrators had been “surrounded by a much larger band of teenagers” and that the boys had “heckled” and “mocked” elder Nathan Phillips, video footage told a different story. – READ MORE",Catholic Priest Slams March for Life as ‘Repulsive and Futile’,education,religious education,167
705494,theguardianuk,"As Donald Trump reiterated his determination that Americans should walk on Mars, Mike Pence marked the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing at the Apollo 11 launch site in Florida on Saturday.

Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon, accompanied Pence to Kennedy Space Center and showed him the pad where he began that momentous journey 50 years ago. Aldrin later got a standing ovation during a speech by Pence.

Mission commander Neil Armstrong, the first man to step onto the moon on 20 July 1969, died seven years ago. Command module pilot Michael Collins, who did not land on the moon, did not attend the Florida celebration.

Pence said Apollo 11 was the only event of the 20th century that “stands a chance of being widely remembered in the 30th century”. The vice-president reiterated the Trump administration’s push to put Americans back on the moon by 2024.

In a presidential message to mark “Space Exploration Day”, Trump said: “Sustained exploration that extends from our Earth to the moon and on to the Martian surface will usher in a new era of American ingenuity, drawing untold individuals into the fields of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and defense.”

Elsewhere around the US, even as parts of the country sweltered under dangerous heat, anniversary events attracted sizeable crowds.

At the Museum of Flight in Seattle, the spacecraft that carried the three-man crew to the moon and back to Earth was on display as part of a traveling exhibit from the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC.

The Seattle museum added its own artefacts and some from private collections, including engine parts from Apollo missions that were salvaged from deep in the Atlantic ocean by Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos.

Visitor Gilda Warden sat on a bench and gazed in awe at the Apollo 11 command module, Columbia.

“It’s like entering the Sistine Chapel and seeing the ceiling. You want to just sit there and take it in,” said Warden, 63, a psychiatric nurse from Tacoma.

A celebration planned for Times Square in New York City was moved to a hotel due to the heat wave affecting the east coast and midwest. But the game went ahead at Yankee Stadium, where former space shuttle astronaut Mike Massimino threw out the ceremonial first pitch to former pitcher Jack Aker, who was on the mound when the 20 July 1969 game was interrupted to announce that the Eagle had landed.

Armstrong and Aldrin were “A1, No1, higher than major league,” Aker said.

In the aptly named Apollo, Pennsylvania, located in Armstrong county not far from the town of Mars and Moon Township, the local historical society revived an annual moon-landing celebration. All of the Apollo astronauts have long been honorary citizens of Apollo, the society’s Alan Morgan said.

In Armstrong’s hometown, Wapakoneta, Ohio, a smaller-scale event went ahead as local athletes competed in “Run to the Moon” races.

Wapakoneta 10K runner Robert Rocco, 54, a retired air force officer from Centerville, Ohio, called the moon landing by Armstrong and Aldrin “perhaps the most historic event in my lifetime, maybe in anybody’s lifetime”.

At events around the US, clocks counted down to the exact moment of the Eagle’s landing on the moon, 4.17pm ET, and Armstrong’s momentous step onto the lunar surface, at 10.56pm ET. The powdered orange drink Tang was back in vogue for toasts, along with MoonPies, including a 55lbs, 45,000-calorie MoonPie at Kennedy’s One Giant Leap bash in Florida.

About 100 visitors and staff at the American Space Museum in Titusville, across the Indian river from Kennedy, cheered and lifted plastic champagne cups of Tang at precisely 4.17pm.

“This is what we’re here for, to share the American space experience,” explained executive director Karan Conklin, who led the toast.

714228,theguardianuk,"Boris Johnson has been accused of displaying an “utterly outrageous” lack of concern about the severe floods that have devastated hundreds of homes and caused more than 1,200 properties to be evacuated in northern England.

Under increasing pressure over the issue, the prime minister chaired a meeting of the government’s emergency committee Cobra on Tuesday after he was criticised by Jeremy Corbyn for not declaring a national emergency.

Afterwards, the government announced it would “provide funding to support the recovery efforts of local councils where households and businesses have been affected”.

It said a community recovery grant would be made available to local councils, equivalent to £500 per eligible household, and businesses would be eligible for up to £2,500 each. An additional 100 armed forces personnel will also be deployed.

Speaking afterwards, Johnson said the country had to “prepare for more floods” this winter because the ground is so waterlogged.

Criticism of Johnson by opposition leaders was echoed in the towns badly affected by the downpours, where 30 flood warnings remain in place including five “danger to life” alerts along the River Don in South Yorkshire.

In the Nottinghamshire town of Worksop, scores of residents were evacuated and more than 200 homes and businesses were flooded on Friday after a month’s worth of rain fell in 24 hours.

Simon Greaves, the Labour leader of Bassetlaw district council, said Johnson had been “preoccupied with electioneering” when he should have been coordinating a national response to the disaster, which encompasses Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and South Yorkshire.

He said: “The government had a fantastic opportunity to step up to the plate and take emergency action. For me, they were concentrating more on the general election campaign than they were on people’s lives. They had an opportunity to take action [and] they consciously chose not to. I think it’s utterly outrageous.”

Johnson was filmed mopping up in a branch of Specsavers when he visited flood-hit Matlock on Friday night after campaigning in nearby Mansfield. Earlier that day the body of Annie Hall, the former high sheriff of Derbyshire, had been found, after she had been swept away by the River Derwent at Darley Dale, not far from Matlock.

On his visit to Derbyshire, the prime minister said the government needed to invest in flood defences but that the floods were not “looking like something we need to escalate to the level of a national emergency”.

The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, visited Fishlake near Doncaster on Tuesday, where she announced her party’s plans for a £5bn flood prevention fund that local authorities would be able to access to improve their area’s defences.

Sue Marshall, who has been unable to return to her house since she was evacuated on Saturday, said she hoped the political visits would lead to real help for those affected – and that she feared being flooded on Thursday, when more rain is forecast.

“I’ve just said to Jo Swinson that it’s all very well her doing this but in a month’s time we’re going to be old news,” she said. “What we need to know is that in two months’ time, the MPs will revisit this and look at what has been done to stop it happening again. And my immediate concern is what are they doing now to stop it happening on Thursday.”

Corbyn made his second trip to the affected area in a week on Tuesday afternoon visiting a site of serious flooding in Doncaster, eight miles from where the Lib Dem leader made an appearance earlier in the day. He used the visit to announce Labour’s plans for a new £5.6bn fund to level up flood defences over 10 years, funded through the party’s £250bn Green Transformation Fund.



The Labour leader was shown around Custom Windows and Doors in Bentley, which has become the site of a community effort to help people affected by the floods back on their feet, housing piles of donated clothes and food.



Asked whether politicians were guilty of taking advantage of the disaster in South Yorkshire for their own electoral advantage, Corbyn said it was important that people understood that the party was serious about “providing the resources necessary to deal with what are the personal and human disasters of floods”.



Corbyn said that the Conservatives always ignored the needs of the north of England. His party’s proposed fund would prioritise areas of need in the north-west, Yorkshire and the East Midlands.



Emma King, 36, showed Corbyn around the home she lives in with her three children and partner. Her house was flooded on Friday and she said it now smelled like “stale, rotten fish”. King’s house was last flooded in 2007. “It shouldn’t have happened again,” she said.



Gwen Kincel’s home was flooded on Saturday, 12 years after it was last flooded in 2007. “They promised us this would never happen again and it has,” said Kincel, 69. “It was the same in 2007. I spent a year living upstairs last time until the downstairs of my house was back to normal and now i’m going to have to do it again.”

David Hughes, the mayor of Matlock, said it was right that the government had called an emergency meeting but he was surprised that Johnson had not yet visited the worst-affected areas. “Obviously if people are flooded for days and days on end then it is an emergency for them and it seems to be over a large area,” he said. “Given the persistency [of the floods], yes I think he probably should make a visit.”

In the Doncaster suburb of Bentley, which remained under a severe flood warning on Tuesday, Tony Nicholson said there was anger at the hierarchy of the town’s Labour council and the Conservative government over their response to the disaster.

“If this was in another area this would be deemed a national emergency. This is devastating for people’s lives,” said Nicholson, a Green party parish councillor. Nicholson said he was not making a party political point but was angry at the official response at a national and local level.

“It’s the official response that’s the issue, whoever is in charge,” he said. “It seems it has not been fast enough and because these people are not wealthy people and it has happened before, they have a sense that they’re not that important.”

Jane Cox, the leader of the Conservative group on Doncaster council, said it was inappropriate to score political points out of a human tragedy. “It does matter that [the government] should acknowledge it but I firmly believe it should not be politicised,” she said. “I would be horrified if anyone started slating anyone from the Labour party for what has happened.”",Boris Johnson accused of 'outrageous' lack of concern about floods,politics,political process,1093
162655,eveningstandard,"Commuters faced a second night of travel misery this evening as ""flash blizzards"" wreaked havoc on roads and rail in the south of Britain.

A weather warning for snow was extended for four hours until midnight as forecasters warned wintry showers affecting southern England will continue to move slowly southwards throughout Friday night.

Travellers were hit by long delays and schools closed their doors today as February began with the coldest night for seven years.

By the evening RAF Odiham in Hampshire had recorded 19cm of snow, while London City Airport was forced to close its runway due to ""heavy snowfall"" at 10pm.

The whiteout caused long delays on the M3 westbound between junctions six and seven, with stranded vehicles sparking tailbacks stretching to Farnborough.

Drivers reported being trapped on the motorway for more than five hours amid the heavy snowfall.

And there were challenging driving conditions and delays reported throughout Hampshire and Surrey, with the A31, A3 and A30 among major roads affected.

Hampshire Police urged motorists to ""please stay in your cars"" amid the adverse weather conditions.

While South Western Railway reported delays on lines between Basingstoke and Windchester as ""multiple"" trees were blocking the railway.

There were flurries of snow throughout the capital on Friday evening but heavy showers appeared to affect the south east of London by 10pm.

Highways England said that one lane of the M3 westbound is now open between junctions six and seven after closures due to snow and stranded vehicles including three jacknifed lorries.

The closure caused severe delays and Highways England urged drivers to consider alternative routes.

Frustrated motorists complained of tailbacks on the M3 as far as London.

Lee Evans tweeted: ""The M3 Westbound (eg out of London) is now largely a car park and is not moving from junction three.

""Do not join the queue as it will be a very long delay.""

James Hemming said he was driving on the A30 from Newbury down to Basingstoke and Salisbury when a “flash blizzard” suddenly struck.

He told the Standard: “Lorries, and me, are struggling with even the slightest incline.

“Pretty much came from nowhere.”

It comes after a coating of up to 14cm of snow caused havoc in the south west on Thursday, forcing motorists to abandon their cars and seek shelter as traffic stood still.

Following the snowy conditions rail commuters living in south east London and Kent were told to ""travel earlier or later to avoid the busiest trains"" as Southeastern's winter weather timetable came into effect today.

Most flights were cancelled from a snow-covered Bristol Airport on Friday, but normal service is expected on Saturday.

Flight disruption at airports in Cardiff and Bristol left queues of rugby fans facing a race to get to Paris ahead of Friday evening's France vs Wales Six Nations opener.

Ex-Wales captain and BBC pundit Sam Warburton was one of the passengers due to fly on the cancelled 9.30am flight from Cardiff Airport to Charles de Gaulle, while fan Leon Brown's axed flight forced him to put his two game tickets up for sale.

Salt-spreaders covered 80,000 miles of England's motorways and major A roads through the night to keep traffic moving, Highways England said.

More snow is forecast going into the weekend, and though it is unlikely to be as heavy, there is a danger of untreated, treacherous ice covering paths and roads.

A fresh yellow warning for snow and ice covering large areas of the UK took effect from noon on Friday until the same time on Saturday.

It covers northern Scotland, most of Northern Ireland, the eastern coast of England and the west coast of Wales.

A separate warning for ice is in place for the southern counties between 1pm on Friday and 11am on Saturday.

Conditions will be largely bright and cold through Saturday but a widespread hard frost and freezing fog are forecast for the early hours of Sunday.

And temperatures this weekend could drop even lower than the blisteringly cold -15.4C experienced during the latest Arctic snap across Britain.

On Thursday night the temperature hit the sub-zero figure in the Scottish highlands, the lowest recorded since 2012.

Met Office forecaster Bonnie Diamond said: “Saturday could threaten the coldest night of the year so far.”

This again would be in “very rural Scotland”, she added.

Expanding upon the weekend, Ms Diamond said the temperatures across the board are to stay low while “wintry showers” are also possible.

However, crisp winter sunshine is set to shine down in many areas.

On Saturday, she said: “Another cold day but there will be plenty of winter sunshine for many.”

She added the snow will not be as widespread but there will still be “a few wintry showers of snow”.

The areas most likely to be affected by snow are coastlines in the north and to the east, though as rain comes in from the west this could see elsewhere impacted.

New weather warnings are in place for parts of Scotland and the north west of England, which will continue in to Monday.

Throughout the days, temperatures are expected to sit around 2C to 4C, but overnight across the weekend most places will be sub-zero.

For London, there is a slim chance of wintry showers on Saturday, though the frosty downpours are not likely to spread strongly inland.

Snow beating down across Britain has already led to chaos on roads and at airports across the nation.

Highgate Hill in London saw major disruption with vehicles unable to get up the incline due to the coating across the road.

Buses were seen along the route stuck due to losing grip on the carriageway and unable to move.

Transport for London said that certain bus journeys were being cut short due to the large red wagons becoming stuck.

Elsewhere on Friday, a landslip at a village in Cornwall blocked off vehicle access to around 30 homes and kept other cars trapped inside a cul-de-sac.

Around 1,000 tonnes of hillside collapsed on to the narrow Scrations Lane, in the village of Lostwithiel, but no-one was injured and no property damaged, Cornwall Council said.

More than 100 people who left their cars on the A30 to seek shelter at a pub in Cornwall were told to pick up their vehicles ""as soon as possible"" by Highways England.

Councillor Geoff Brown, who handles transport at Cornwall Council, said ""the actions of a few impacted on many"" after abandoned cars blocked emergency services, delaying the clear-up.

Authorities asked motorists to completely clear their vehicles of snow and Wiltshire and Thames Valley police forces advised drivers to travel only if absolutely necessary.

One driver claimed he ""could see perfectly well"" after his car, with its side windows completely encased in snow, was stopped in High Wycombe, police added.

Meanwhile, images posted online showed firefighters working with shovels to clear a route out of their stations.

Thousands of schoolchildren were enjoying an extended weekend as hundreds of schools closed their doors on Thursday and Friday.

Friday's closures included more than half of Bristol's schools, more than 300 in Buckinghamshire, more than 150 in Cornwall and scores across Oxfordshire.

On the rail network, passengers were urged to check before they travel in case the conditions impact services and some Eurostar services were cancelled on Friday.

Transport for London also advised passengers to check their service status before setting off.

The Met Office said a low of -15.4C (4.3F) was recorded just before midnight on Thursday at Braemar in the Scottish Highlands.

Had it fallen more than 0.2C (0.4F) lower it would have surpassed the low of -15.6C (3.92F) set in 2012.",UK snow and weather forecast: fresh snow chaos as drivers become stranded during &apos;blizzard&apos; in Basingstoke amid big freeze,weather,weather statistic,1215
106355,cnn,"""We need to be there for workers across this country who have always been the engine of our economy,"" the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate said, a day after speaking at the Iowa AFL-CIO Convention. ""We need to keep up the fight for $15 an hour to ensure that one job is enough -- and no one needs to work a second or third job to support themselves and their families. Only then can we build an economy that finally works for everyone in this country.""

Under O'Rourke's ""21st Century Labor Contract,"" workers will be able to join a union if they so wish, get paid a living wage no matter the industry, will not need to work a second or third job to provide for a family, will not be face discrimination in the job search process, will have access to job training and will have access to a fair labor market.

In a Medium post from O'Rourke's campaign , this plan is highlighted as ""a new contract between workers, employers, and the federal government,"" ensuring that any worker who wants can form a union and those who are not members will experience many of the same protections a union provides such as overtime and paid sick days.

O'Rourke has made raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour a staple of his stump speech on the trail throughout the duration of his campaign and he includes this policy proposal in this plan, as well as signing the Paycheck Fairness Act, which passed the House of Representatives this year.

He also issuing his plan to call for free community college so students, including undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children, can receive occupation training to enter the workforce. Additionally, the plan laid out by O'Rourke calls for protecting LGBTQ workers from discrimination, protecting workers lacking immigration status from retaliation and threats by employers, ensuring seven days of sick leave per year, banning non-compete agreements and using federal health care spending as a lever to raise wages for health and long-term care workers. O'Rourke's trip to Iowa this week was his first since rebooting his campaign after the mass shooting on August 3 in his hometown of El Paso, Texas, where a gunman who police say posted a screed online that warned of a ""Hispanic invasion"" killed 22 people at a Walmart. Since the shooting, O'Rourke has rolled out a new plan to combat gun violence and white nationalism in America, and has visited towns in southern states affected by the Trump administration's policies, including two stops in Mississippi to offer support to immigrant families affected by ICE raids at several processing plants in the state.",Beto O'Rourke rolls out new plan to protect workers' rights,labour,employment legislation,444
41376,bbcuk,"England manager Phil Neville says he has been planning for a crucial Women's World Cup meeting with the United States since the day he took the job.

Neville's side face the holders in Lyon in the last four on Tuesday, aiming to reach the final for the first time.

Victory would make the Lionesses the first senior England team to reach a major global final since 1966.

""We've planned for it, we've played against them and we know how we're going to play,"" Neville told BBC Sport.

""When it was France or USA in the semi-final every one of my players said: 'Let's hope it's USA.'

""When I got the job [in January 2018], the first three games I looked at were the USA. I was sitting in my house in Valencia and watched three games in one afternoon because I thought: 'How can we win the World Cup?'

""You have to beat the best, and the USA are the best. They've proven it.

""But we're ready for them. Sometimes, before these games, you can have fear and trepidation - but I can smell nothing but freedom, happiness and excitement.""

The Lionesses have reached the last four for the second World Cup - and a third major tournament - in a row and have a fully fit squad.

They beat Norway 3-0 in the quarter-finals, with a record-breaking UK television audience of 7.6 million cheering them on.

Favourites and three-time champions the USA - who have never failed to make the semi-finals of the World Cup - beat hosts France.

Both sides have been preparing for the game amid a heatwave across France, but temperatures are expected to be slightly fresher by Tuesday's 20:00 BST kick-off. A crowd of close to the Stade de Lyon's tournament capacity of 57,900 is expected.

European champions the Netherlands face Sweden in Wednesday's other semi-final, with the winners from the two matches meeting in the final in Lyon on Sunday. The losers will play in Saturday's third-place play-off in Nice.

The United States, who are top of the world rankings, go into the match as favourites against third-ranked England and have won 10 of the teams' 16 meetings.

But legendary USA keeper Hope Solo told BBC Sport the Lionesses have the tactical edge and that ""they will have a better chance to beat the USA in a World Cup match than ever before"".

Both sides have won every game so far at these finals but England's Lyon defender Lucy Bronze, who will be playing at her home stadium, believes her side have a clear advantage over all the other semi-finalists.

""We have more hunger than the other teams because we have never reached a final,"" said Bronze, who has never lost a game at the Stade de Lyon.

""You look at the four teams left and we're the only team that hasn't reached a final. The Olympics, the World Cup, the Euros, these other three teams have all reached finals in recent years.

""It definitely takes more to reach a final - but who better to know that it takes more than a team that has been knocked out of two consecutive semi-finals?""

After beating Norway to reach the semi-finals, Neville said his team's mantra is that they want to be ""badass women"".

In the United States, they come up against a group of players who are established stars - striker Alex Morgan was the only footballer apart from Liverpool's Mohamed Salah to feature in Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people of 2019 - and they are involved in a fight with US Soccer for pay equality with the men's team.

But England forward Nikita Parris insists the Lionesses, who drew with the USA 2-2 in their last meeting en route to winning the SheBelieves Cup on American soil in March, will not be overawed.

""Why shouldn't we think we can be badder than them when we went to the SheBelieves and we won it?"" said Parris, who will be playing at her new club ground after moving from Manchester City to Lyon this summer.

""We went toe to toe with them. We beat them under [previous manager] Mark Sampson's reign. Why shouldn't we think we can beat them? Why do we have to come to this tournament semi-final and think 'oh, it's America'?

""Nobody fears America. Nobody fears Germany. What's the point in coming to a World Cup if you're not prepared to dream? These are the moments you live for.""

USA winger and co-captain Megan Rapinoe has scored two goals in both of their knockout games to give them back-to-back 2-1 victories.

The 33-year-old's match-winning doubles came either side of her being criticised by president Donald Trump for snubbing a potential post-tournament visit to the White House.

On Tuesday, she is set to go head to head with England right-back Bronze, who Neville has said is the ""best player in the world"" and ""deserves to win the Ballon d'Or"" award.

England's Lyon midfielder Izzy Christiansen - who missed the tournament after being injured in March - told the BBC: ""Her [Megan Rapinoe] up against Lucy [Bronze] is going to be one heck of a battle.

""It is one which could potentially win or lose the game, given both their form.""

Three of the players set to be involved on Tuesday are tied on five goals at the top of the tournament standings, along with Australia's Sam Kerr, although the Matildas were eliminated in the last 16.

Manchester City and England striker Ellen White's tap-in against Norway was her fifth goal of the campaign, putting her alongside Kerr and the USA duo of Rapinoe and Morgan.

""It's a shootout maybe between Ellen and Alex Morgan for the top scorer,"" Neville said. ""There are going to be brilliant players on this football pitch.""

According to Gracenote Sports, which captures and curates sports data, the USA have the highest chance of lifting the trophy on 7 July, with a 41% probability, according to simulations.

England, who have never knocked a higher-ranked side out of the tournament, are said to have a 38% chance of reaching the final.

The USA against the Netherlands is deemed to be the most likely final, with the Lionesses and the Oranje both said to have a 22% chance of becoming champions.

An England v Sweden final is statistically the least likely, with the Swedes said to have only a 16% chance of glory on Sunday.

heritage-site-of-palmyra/)

 **Submitted by Olivia Kroth…**

The destruction of Palmyra at the hands of ISIS stands out as one of the most
barbaric deeds during the eight-year proxy war that western governments
unleashed against Syria. Known as the ‘Venice of the Sands’, the ancient
Syrian city of Palmyra – located at the edge of an oasis of date palms and
gardens – was a wealthy caravan centre from the 1st to the 3rd centuries after
Christ, sometimes independent and at other times under the control of Rome.
During the past few years, members of ISIS managed to damage or even
completely destroy some of the most significant monuments in ancient Palmyra,
a UNESCO World Heritage site. The antique site has not been restored yet, due
to the ongoing proxy war in Syria, which is secretly spurred by western
states’ financial and military aid for ISIS. Russia is taking the lead as a
driving force of restoration in Palmyra.

Before the outbreak of the proxy war, in March 2011, Palmyra’s UNESCO heritage
site was one of the top tourist attractions in the Middle East. Since then,
parts of the heritage site have been damaged constantly and one monument after
the other has disppeared. Syrian government officials say they transferred
about 300,000 artifacts to safe places in recent years.

UNESCO, the UN heritage agency, has called the destruction an “intolerable
crime against civilization”. UNESCO General Director Irina Bokova exclaimed:
“This destruction is a war crime, an immense loss for the Syrian people and
for humanity. This blow against cultural heritage shows that cultural
cleansing led by violent extremists is seeking to destroy both human lives and
historical monuments in order to deprive the Syrian people of its past and its
future. This is why the protection of heritage is inseparable from the
protection of human lives, and we must all unite to put this at the centre of
all efforts to build peace.”

As Syria’s loyal partner and ally, Russia has taken the lead in restoring the
ancient site of Palmyra. In the coming months, Moscow will share its files on
restoring Syria’s Palmyra with UNESCO, including a 3D model, Russia’s Defence
Minister and President of the Russian Geographical Society (RGO) Sergey Shoigu
revealed in an interview with TASS, Rossiyskaya Gazeta and Komsomolskaya
Pravda.

Sergey Shoigy explained: “Combing through our archives we have uncovered
photos of Palmyra, taken in 1872 by the first Russian travellers who arrived
there. Now we are putting together an album, in which we want to show what was
there and what has been damaged or destroyed. This endeavor is needed to
understand what to do next. Therefore we are creating a 3D model of Palmyra.
Soon we will send these files to UNESCO so that they can assess the overall
volume of restoration works” (TASS, 19.03.2019).

Palmyra is an oasis in the Syrian desert, north-east of Damascus. Palmyra
contains the monumental ruins of a great city that was one of the most
important cultural centres of the ancient world. First mentioned in archives
in the 2nd millennium BC (before Christ), Palmyra became an established
caravan oasis during the times of the Roman Empire,  from the first to third
centuries AC (after Christ). It grew steadily in importance as a city on the
trade route linking Persia, India and China with the Roman Empire, marking the
crossroads of several civilisations in the ancient world.

A grand, colonnaded street of 1100 metres’ length forms the monumental axis of
the city, which together with secondary colonnaded cross streets links the
major public monuments including the Temple of Baal, Diocletian’s Camp, the
Agora, Theatre, other temples and urban quarters. Discovery of the ruined city
by travellers in the 17th and 18th centuries resulted in its subsequent
influence on architectural styles.

In 1980, Palmyra became part of the UNESCO World Heritage, due to the
following criteria: “The splendour of the ruins of Palmyra, rising out of the
Syrian desert north-east of Damascus is testament to the unique aesthetic
achievement of a wealthy caravan oasis intermittently under the rule of Rome
from the 1st to the 3rd century after Christ.

The grand colonnade constitutes a characteristic example of a type of
structure which represents a major artistic development. Recognition of the
splendour of the ruins of Palmyra by travellers in the 17th and 18th centuries
contributed greatly to the subsequent revival of classical architectural
styles and urban design in the West.”

The primitive barbarians of ISIS are certainly not able to value the
architectural and cultural achievements of former times, as they are
destroying one part of Palmyra after the other, claiming the “destruction of
idolatry”. Religious tolerance is an alien concept to these savages, just like
the idea that our global human heritage needs to be preserved for future
generations.

The vandals of ISIS are too fanatic, too uneducated, too uncouth to understand
that these structures from the past provide fixed locations for national
narratives, constructed in the present, and are symbols for the future as
well.

In August 2015, the Temple of Baal was severely damaged by ISIS. This temple
of the Mesopotamian deity Baal formed the centre of religious life in Palmyra
and was dedicated in 32 BC. It showed a wonderful synthesis of ancient Near-
Eastern and Greco-Roman architecture. The temple had a rectangular shape and
was oriented north-south.

The northern chamber was known for a bas-relief carving of the seven planets,
surrounded by the twelve signs of the Zodiac. It also showed a procession of
camels and veiled women. In the court there were the remains of an altar and a
basin, a dining hall and a building with niches. In the northwest corner lay a
ramp, along which sacrificial animals were led into the temple area. After the
devastation by ISIS, only the arched main entrance into the temple is still
intact, as well as its exterior walls and the fortified gate.

In the Semitic languages, Baal was a name for “Lord” or “Master”. He was
probably a weather god, with power over lightning, rain and wind. The dry
summers of the area were explained as Baal’s time in the underworld. His
return in autumn was said to cause the storms which revived the land. Thus,
the worship of Baal was connected to the region’s dependence on rainfall for
its agriculture. Anxiety about the availability of water for crops and trees
increased the importance of his cult, which focused attention on his role as a
rain god.

In the same month of that year, August 2015, the hordes of ISIS also destroyed
the Temple of Baalshamin in Palmyra. Have these architectonic jewels been lost
forever? Following the recapture of Palmyra by the Syrian Army in March 2016,
the director of antiquities Maamoun Abdelkarim stated that the Temple of
Baalshamin along with the Temple of Baal would be rebuilt, using the surviving
remains.

The temple of Baalshamin’s earliest phase dates back to the late 2nd century
BC. Its altar was built in 115 BC. It represented a fusion of ancient Syrian
and Roman architectural styles. The temple’s proportions and the capitals of
its columns were Roman in inspiration, while the side windows followed the
Syrian tradition. The side walls were decorated with pilasters.

Baalshamin was another Semitic God venerated in Syria. The name means “Lord of
the Heavens”. His attributes were the eagle and the lightning bolt. He formed
a triad with the lunar god Aglibol and the sun god Malakbel.

In Palmyra archaeologists found the limestone relief “divine triad”, dating
back to the 1st century BC. It shows Baalshamin in the middle, surrounded by
Aglibol on the left and Malakbel on the right. The three deities wear
breastplates with lamellas. All three hold a sword decorated with gems in
their left hand. The right hands are missing. We do not know if they made a
gesture of blessing or if they held a spear. In the background there is an
inscription in the old alphabet of Palmyra.

The necropolis of Palmyra also became a victim of ISIS attacks. In September
2015, the terrorists blew up a total of six funerary towers, including the
three best preserved. They destroyed the tower of Kithot (44 AC), the tower of
Iamblichos (83 AC) and the tower of Elahbel (103 AC). Outside the city limits
lie various burial grounds, which are named after their location as the north,
southeast, southwest and western necropolis in the “Valley of Graves”.

According to the inscriptions these sepulchres were erected between 9 BC and
128 AC. The funerary tower of Elahbel was the largest tower. In these
sepulchres, where numerous dead found their final resting place, four storeys
were connected by narrow spiral staircases. The exterior of the tower tombs
was usually plain. Inside, however, they were richly decorated with
architectural and sculptural ornaments.

Just one month later, in October 2015, ISIS blew up  the Monumental Arch, also
called the Arch of Triumph or Arch of Septimius Severus. It was built in the
third century AC, during the reign of the Roman Emperor Septimius Severus,
which lasted from 193 to 211 AC. This arch linked the main street of the
Colonnade with the Temple of Baal.

The  Monumental Arch consisted of a large gateway in the centre, flanked by a
smaller opening on both sides. It was decorated with ornate stone carvings,
including reliefs depicting plants or geometrical designs. The reliefs on the
Monumental Arch were described by UNESCO as “an outstanding example of
Palmyrene art”. It was one of the most lavishly adorned monuments of the
ancient desert town.

Appalled by so much destruction, the famous Russian maestro Valery Gergiev
gave a concert in the ruins of Palmyra, on the 5th of May 2016. He conducted
the Mariinsky Symphony Orchestra from Saint Petersburg at Palmyra’s Roman
Theatre. The conductor led the orchestra through pieces by the Russian
composers Sergei Prokofiev and Rodion Shchedrin. Russian soldiers, government
ministers, journalists and many interested Syrian spectators were present.

The maestro described the concert as a protest against the barbarism and
violence exhibited by ISIS terrorists, who had used the Roman Theatre to
execute prisoners. On this occasion, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin
addressed the audience by video link from his Black Sea residence in Sochi. He
called terrorism a contagion, of which the world needed to rid itself.

“I regard the concert as a sign of gratitude, remembrance and hope,” he said,
adding that everybody should be grateful to “those who fight terrorism without
sparing one’s own life.” The Russian President called on people to remember
“all victims of terror” and to “hope not just for the revival of Palmyra as
cultural heritage of humanity but also for the rescue of modern civilization
from this terrible menace – international terrorism.”

“The concert in Palmyra is a highly spiritual response to those who wanted to
destroy Syria, to split the country along national and religious lines,”
Konstantin Dolgov, Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs human rights chief,
wrote on Twitter (RUSSIA TODAY, 05.05.2016).

The concert was titled “Pray for Palmyra. Music revives ancient remains”. Its
date coincided with the handover of Aleksander Prokhorenko’s remains for
burial. The Russian special forces officer died in Syria, surrounded by ISIS
terrorists. He was killed in April 2016, when Palmyra was recaptured by the
Syrian Army, while Russian air strikes provided support.

Back in Russia, maestro Valery Gergiev gave an interview, in which he called
the concert in Palmyra a ” humanitarian gesture. An act of sympathy and
support. People there have experienced terrible events. We heard explosions in
Palmyra at a distance of several kilometres, while we prepared for our
rehearsal. The theatre has about two thousand years of history. It is superb,
beautiful, a magnificent architectural ensemble, worthy of humanity.”

This concert, however, did not impress ISIS. The terrorists continued on their
rampant path of destruction. In December 2016, ISIS destroyed the Tetrapylon,
a monument marking a major road intersection along the colonnaded street of
Palmyra. It was a testimony to the grandeur of the era around 270 AC, during
which Queen Zenobia had reached the height of her power.

Tetrapylon were monuments which the Romans placed at the intersections of
major streets. They had four openings and were associated with the worship of
Janus, the Roman god of gates and doorways. The Tetrapylon of Palmyra was a
striking example of this form of Roman monument. Each of the four groups of
pillars supported 150,000 kg of solid cornice. It was one of the rare
structures in Syria, where pink granite columns were employed. The granite
came fron Assuan in Egypt.

Septimia Zenobia (240–274 AC) was a Queen of the Palmyrene Empire. She was a
cultured monarch and fostered an intellectual environment in her court, which
was open to scholars and philosophers. Queen Zenobia was tolerant toward her
subjects and protected religious minorities. She maintained a stable
administration, which governed a multicultural and multiethnic empire. Her
rise and death have inspired historians, artists and novelists. Zenobia has
become a patriotic symbol in Syria.

In the Russian Empire, Empress Catherine the Great was likened to “Queen
Zenobia, the powerful ruler of the Palmyran Empire, who conquered Egypt and a
large swathe of Anatolia. In the time of Pushkin, Russian writers further
developed the allusion, drawing more generally upon the reputed beauty and
cultural richness of Roman Palmyra”, Gilbert Doctorov notes in his interesting
essay, “Civilization returns to Palmyra – while the West scoffs” (GLOBAL
RESEARCH, 08.05.2016).

The Roman Theatre, where maestro Gergiev and the Mariinsky Symphony Orchestra
had played, was severely damaged by ISIS, in January 2017. It dates back to
the 2nd  century AC. The theatre was constructed in the centre of a
semicircular colonnaded piazza, which opened up to the South Gate of Palmyra.
The main entrances were 3,5 metres wide, leading to a stone-paved orchestra
with a diametre of 23,5 metres. The orchestra was bounded by a circular wall
with a diametre of 20,3 metres. The proscenium wall was decorated with ten
curved and nine rectangular niches placed alternately.

When ISIS recaptured Palmyra at the beginnning of 2017, they completely
destroyed the facade of the theatre, according to Mamoun Abdulkarim, Director
of the Syrian government agency of antiquities and museums. Syrian authorities
reported that satellite images showed signs of intentional destruction.

Mikhail Piotrovsky, a scholar of Arabic and director of the Hermitage Museum
in Saint Petersburg, said that it was an act of reprisal in response to the
classical concert staged by Russia. Drone footage shot by the Russian Ministry
of Defence showed that the theatre was partially destroyed. The central part
of the stage suffered severe damage.

Palmyra was retaken by Syrian government forces, in early March 2017. The
Syrian authorities hoped that tourists could return soon but nothing has come
of it yet. Restoration of the damaged sites had to be postponed. The governor
of Homs, Tar al-Barazi, told the press that Syrian Palmyra would be ready to
welcome its first tourists in the summer of 2019 (TASS, 15.08.2018). Due to
the ongoing war, however, his hopes have been crushed. Some western powers and
their proxy ally ISIS seem to have a geopolitical as well as a military
interest in keeping the pot boiling.

The director of Russia’s Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg offered
expertise to help restore the ancient Syrian city. “Restoring Palmyra is the
responsibility of all of us,” Mikhail Piotrovsky told TASS. “Restoring Palmyra
is a long-term task, and it is essential that we take our time,” he said,
estimating that up to 70 percent of the ancient historic site could have been
damaged or destroyed. He noted that Russia has “plenty of experience with
restoring destroyed historic monuments”, notably after World War II (TASS,
02.06.2016).

Rebuilding, reconstructing, recreating and restoring cannot be carried out
when a war is still ongoing and should not be rushed. Yet one thing is clear:
the victorious side will decide how to carry out this post-war work in
Palmyra. Surely the Syrian Government, with Russia’s help, will authorize the
plans and supervise their implementation.

Meanwhile, the world is waiting for the restoration of the UNESCO World
Heritage site in Syria and the Russian saying is still valid: “Pray for
Palmyra”.

1580,abcnews,"The Trump administration is looking to decrease the Education Department’s funding by $7.1 billion compared to what it was given last year, as part of next year’s proposed budget.

The budget proposal suggests eliminating 29 programs, including after-school and summer programs for students in high-poverty areas, among other things.

The budget proposal is unlikely to pass through Congress – especially with Democrats in control of the House, however, it is a glimpse into the Trump administration’s priorities going into the next fiscal year.

In a statement on Monday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said the proposed cuts show “commitment to spending taxpayer dollars wisely and efficiently by consolidating or eliminating duplicative and ineffective federal programs.”

She also said the “budget at its core is about education freedom,” an apparent nod to the issue of school choice – something DeVos has attempted to champion during her time as head of the department.

The proposed budget includes DeVos’ school choice platform by asking for an increase in $60 million for the Charters Schools Program.

The budget also requests $700 million for school safety measures from multiple agencies, including the Education Department, the Justice Department and Health and Human Services.

“After the tragedy in Parkland, Florida, the President established the Federal Commission on School Safety to assess and develop Federal, State, and local policy recommendations to help prevent violence in schools,” the 2020 budget proposal reads.

“The Budget provides approximately $700 million, an increase of $354 million compared to the 2019 Budget, in Departments of Education, Justice, and Health and Human Services grants to give States and school districts resources to implement the Commission’s recommendations, such as expanding access to mental healthcare, developing threat assessments, and improving school climate.”

American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten issued a statement responding to the proposed cuts, criticizing the DeVos’ leadership at the department.

“Rather than increase funding for kids with special needs or for those who live below the poverty line in both rural and urban America, or addressing the issues raised in their own safety report, DeVos once again seeks to divert funding for private purposes in the name of ‘choice,’” Weingarten said.

The statement continued: “However, if they listened to parents, they would hear that, overwhelmingly, parents want well-funded public schools as their choice.”

Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, also criticized the budget’s Education Department proposals, saying it showed “how wildly out of sync” DeVos is.

“Secretary DeVos is proposing gutting investments in students, teachers, public schools, and even school safety—all to make ro for her extreme privatization proposal that no one asked for. This is not a serious budget proposal, and I am going to once again work with Republicans in Congress to ensure every student has access to a quality public education in their neighborhood,” Murray’s statement said.",Trump administration proposes $7.1 billion funding decrease to Education Department,education,school,465
1031969,thevaccinereaction,"One commonly cited reason for claiming a religious vaccine exemption has to do with the fact that some vaccines are made using aborted fetal cell lines. As reported in an April 26, 2019, article in Christianity Today:1

An Ethical Dilemma for Many of Faith

Vaccine manufacturing is not dependent on the ongoing procurement of aborted fetal tissue, and the Catholic Church issued a statement2 in 2005 assuring Catholics that by getting vaccinated they are not “cooperating in evil.”

Yet the idea of injecting themselves or their children with a substance manufactured using aborted fetal cells still makes some Christians, Jews, Muslims and those of other faiths or personal beliefs feel morally uneasy.3 Pro-vaccine advocates and most agnostics have a hard time comprehending why though. As reported by Christianity Today:4

However, the article points out that the consent issue actually presents a second ethical dilemma rather than solving the first.

Since the fetal tissues were obtained in an era before medical informed consent really became the norm, there’s no guarantee either that the two women gave such consent, or understood that their fetuses’ cell lines would be used to create injectable vaccines for decades to come. An article on Patheos also discusses this issue, displaying the typical intolerance:5

Clearly, this issue is far from cut and dry, but I think it’s important to at least try to empathize with another person’s point of view. The author of the Patheos article concludes that, most likely, the religious objection to vaccines made with fetal cells has more to do with the “ick factor,” opposed to the sentiment that it’s tissue obtained from murder and therefore immoral to partake in.

However, that is conjecture as many individuals have deeply held religious beliefs opposing abortion and use of aborted fetal tissue for scientific research or other purposes.

Today, many other types of cells are used as growth mediums during vaccine production, and many of those raise moral issues as well. Vaccine growth mediums include6 animal cell strains from chickens, dogs, monkeys, hamsters7 and insects,8 as well as cells from bacteria or yeast.

As just one example, the flu vaccine Flucelvax, introduced in 2014, is grown in kidney cells from dogs.9 Bovine serum (from cow’s blood) is also used for some vaccine components, and trace amounts may remain in the vaccine.10 The use of animal cells doesn’t entirely solve the moral dilemma for all religious faiths though. As noted by Christianity Today:11

Regardless of whether you believe the use of fetal cells from abortions in vaccine production is morally reprehensible or completely justified, there may be other reasons to object to being coerced or compelled to use vaccines—or give your children vaccines—that were made using human fetal tissue cells.

According to a study published in the September 2014 issue of the Journal of Public Health and Epidemiology,12 rates of autism strongly correlate with the introduction of vaccines using human fetal cell lines.

Three vaccines in particular were found to be significantly correlated with autism: MMR, varicella (chickenpox) and hepatitis A vaccines. According to the study authors, autism rates rose sharply each time one of these vaccines was released. As reported in this paper:13

Part of the problem has to do with what’s called “insertional mutagenesis,” where DNA mutations are created via a viral vector, either naturally or intentionally.14Indeed, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration Powerpoint presentation15 from 2005 discusses the history of cell-substrate DNA in biological products and some of the “perceived safety issues associated with DNA.” As reported by Global Research in September 2014:16

727928,thehuffingtonpost,"The Washington state governor vowed to enact regulations prohibiting the use of cancer-causing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, common ingredients in nonstick fabrics, food packaging and firefighting foam that now pollute the drinking water of an estimated 19 million Americans.

The 36-page memo, released Monday ahead of the next set of Democratic primary debates in Detroit, provides a detailed look at how an Inslee administration would implement his grand vision of pulling ecological systems back from the brink of collapse while restoring health in poor, predominantly minority communities that bear the brunt of the last century’s pollution.

The governor has already sketched out how he’d eliminate planet-heating emissions across major sectors over the next decade and challenged his competitors to oppose the Enbridge Line 5 proposal to build a new oil and gas pipeline under Michigan’s Straits of Mackinac.

The plan calls for reconstituting the Council on Environmental Quality, a sleepy White House department tasked with coordinating public health policy across federal agencies, as the Council on Environmental Justice. The new entity would ensure that people on the front lines have a role in informing federal policy and put justice and equity at the center of a national climate mobilization. It reiterates the Inslee campaign’s earlier proposals to direct the Department of Justice to aggressively investigate and prosecute corporate polluters.

Income and race are strong indicators of how much pollution exposure an average American can expect to face. Air in Black communities is, on average, 48% more polluted than in wealthier, white neighborhoods, an NAACP report found last year, and they are 75% more likely to live in neighborhoods abutting industrial sites. Black, Hispanic and poor students face the highest risk of inhaling toxic pollutants in crumbling schools across the country, a study published last year in the journal Environmental Research.

“I look at these two concepts as linked both in cause and solution,” Inslee told HuffPost by phone Sunday. “Its cause is pollution. Its solution is ending the dominance of fossil fuels.”

Inslee also proposes a new federal “Equity Impact Mapping” program to “track pollution hotspots, economic inequality and climate change impacts” and suggests implementing an “equity screen” to analyze how federal climate, energy and environmental funding is spent in marginalized communities.

Recalling to the climate equity law New York passed earlier this summer, Inslee’s plan pledges to spend $1.2 trillion ― a guaranteed 40% of the $3 trillion in federal spending the candidate outlined in his inaugural economic proposal ― to poor, pollution-ravaged communities. The proposal includes a provision to create a Universal Clean Energy Services Fund to offset working-class families’ monthly energy bills, which could increase in a rapid transition from fossil fuels.

“Anytime you can solve two problems instead of one, you’ve got to do it,” Inslee said. “It doesn’t mean this is going to solve racial disparity and income inequality, but we think these are good steps.”

Inslee remains at roughly 1% in aggregated polling of a crowded field of candidates. His bid to be the lone champion of addressing climate change, always a long-shot, now faces competition from billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer, who reportedly entered the race this month partly out of frustration that Inslee had yet to achieve a breakout moment.

At last month’s first round of televised primary debates, Inslee took heat for failing to seize the stage and to channel the sort of righteousness on the fast-worsening climate crisis that Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) did on racism.

Last week alone, Steyer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) released their own climate proposals that, while far behind what Inslee put forward, earned praise from groups like 350.org, which said the plans respond “to our calls for climate leadership.”

But the Inslee campaign has nevertheless produced ann unrivaled inventory of detailed environmental proposals, setting what Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) dubbed the “gold standard” for what a Green New Deal could ultimately look like.",Jay Inslee Calls For Banning 'Forever Chemicals' In New Environmental Justice Plan,environment,environmental politics,631
26328,bbc,"India's main opposition leader Rahul Gandhi was all but written off after his crushing defeat in the last elections. But he has energised a struggling Congress party and increasingly set the agenda with a combative campaign. The BBC's Geeta Pandey visits his constituency to assess whether he can unseat the prime minister this time.

The main roads in the small town of Amethi were choked with supporters when Rahul Gandhi turned up to file his nomination papers last week.

Mr Gandhi - smiling and waving on an open truck, accompanied by his sister Priyanka - was greeted all along the 3km route to the district collector's office by party workers. Many waved flags, others carried their photographs and town residents showered them with rose petals.

A man in a horse costume danced to drum beats, a brass band played welcoming tunes and groups of supporters ran alongside the convoy shouting slogans in his support.

""Mr Modi's days are numbered,"" says Mustaqim Ahmed, who has travelled 125km (78 miles) from his village with his 12-year-old son to see the Congress chief.

Anokhelal Tiwari, a resident of Amethi, adds: ""Wait and see, once the votes are counted on 23 May, Mr Modi will known as the ex-prime minister of India. The Congress will form the next government and 'Rahul bhaiya [brother]' will become the prime minister.""

It's a dream Mr Gandhi's supporters in Amethi have had for a long time. In fact, ever since he made his political debut 15 years ago.

The 48-year-old is a three-term MP from this town in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. He is now seeking a fourth term. This time though, he's also standing in Wayanad in the southern state of Kerala - leading to the BJP alleging he's scared of losing Amethi to their candidate Smriti Irani, who put up a tough fight in 2014. Congress leaders have defended the move, saying it will help widen their base in the south.

I followed Mr Gandhi's campaigns closely in 2004, 2009 and 2014 - and each time I was told by supporters they were electing the PM, not an MP. That sentiment is now being echoed in Wayanad too, says my BBC Hindi colleague Imran Qureshi, who's covering the election there.

That's because Rahul Gandhi has the right pedigree: he is the scion of India's political royalty.

His great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the first prime minister of independent India, his grandmother and father also served as prime ministers, while his mother, Italian-born Sonia Gandhi, was the Congress chief until poor health forced her to hand over the reins to her son 16 months ago.

Even before that, there never was any doubt that he was being groomed for the top job. In 2013, he was elevated to the second most senior position in the party and campaigned extensively in the 2014 general election.

So when Congress suffered its most humiliating defeat that year, winning just 44 seats in the 545-member parliament, his political career hit rock bottom.

For a while after that, nothing seemed to be going right for him or the Congress.

The party faced electoral setbacks in several state elections; he was seen as ""remote and inaccessible"" and critics and rivals ridiculed him on social media as a bumbling, clueless leader prone to gaffes. Narendra Modi, who comes from a humble background, repeatedly criticised him for rising to the top not on merit, but because of belonging to the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.

But then things began to change: Mr Gandhi started to emerge from the shadows, his social media campaigns became smarter and he began arguing convincingly about the government's controversial currency ban, a lack of employment opportunities, growing intolerance in the country and the slowdown in the economy.

The proverbial cherry on the cake came in December when he led the Congress to victory in important state elections in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.

And now, as he traverses the length and breadth of the country, addressing up to five rallies daily, his campaign is beginning to get some traction.

Senior journalist Aarthi Ramachandran, author of a 2012 book on Mr Gandhi, says he's displayed leadership potential on the campaign trail by consistently taking a stand against Mr Modi, demanding answers from the government on alleged corruption in the Rafale fighter jet deal and arguing forcefully that the currency ban hit people's lives hard.

""The political acumen he's displaying now was largely absent from his politics earlier,"" she says, adding that his ability to speak too is ""vastly improved"".

""He does these meetings in colleges and universities with young people, he tells them, 'ask me whatever you want'. He connects very well with them. In the parliament too, rather than reading out prepared speeches, he speaks extempore, with confidence.

""He's come into his own, worked hard over a period of time on acquiring skills.""

In recent weeks, there's also been a lot of chatter about the party's minimum income guarantee scheme that promises to give cash handouts to 50 million poor families if the Congress is elected to power. One analyst described it as a ""perfect disrupter"" which could help the party improve their election tally.

It was certainly well-timed - the scheme was announced just as pollsters began suggesting that India's air strikes in Pakistan may help the BJP to victory. The announcement brought the conversation back to poverty and lack of jobs and made the BJP fairly uncomfortable.

But it's not going to be a game-changer in 2019, says Prof Sanjay Kumar of research organisation CSDS (Centre for the Study of Developing Societies).

""It's come a bit too late. Also, the party doesn't have the communication skills or the resources to take it to the people.""

""Their leaders don't have the language skills, they are carrying huge baggage because many in the majority community believe that Congress follows the policy of minority appeasement and when they question the government's honesty and accuse it of corruption, not many are ready to buy that because the Congress have had so many corruption allegations against them in the past.""

The biggest disadvantage though, he says, is that it's not just their support base that's eroded - they also lack the party workers required during an election.

""So I won't put my money on the Congress now,"" he says. ""But that doesn't mean that there is no future for the Congress. Losing one or two elections doesn't mean a party has no future. Remember the 1984 elections when the BJP was reduced to two seats? And it bounced back to 282 in the last election.""

Several Congress leaders, too, have hinted that 2019 is really not a ""do-or-die"" battle for the party and that 2024 is perhaps a much more realistic goal.

In 2004, just as Mr Gandhi had embarked on his political career, I caught up with him during his campaign in Amethi and asked him to assess his chances.

""You win some, you lose some. Maybe I'll win this, maybe I won't,"" he'd said.

I then asked him what he would do if he lost.

""Just because you lose one battle doesn't mean you turn around and close shop and say, 'I can't do anything.' If I lose the election, would I say let's pack our bags and go home? No, no, no.""

So in his own words, he's in it for the long haul. Don't write him off yet.",Can India’s political prince unseat the PM?,politics,political process,1203
545495,sputnik,"Early parliamentary elections have been set in Peru for 26 January amidst the raging political crisis in the South American nation.

""To call elections to a new Congress on Sunday, 26 January, 2020 to end the constitutional period of the dissolved Congress,"" reads the decree, signed by President Martin Vizcarra and new Prime Minister Vicente Zeballos, as cited by El Peruano newspaper.

The decree stated that the votes of no confidence in two cabinets formed under the current government's term (2016-2021) as the reason for the Congress' dissolution.

In line with Article 134 of the Peruvian Constitution, the president has the right to dissolve parliament should two cabinets be removed over no-confidence motions.

According to the document, legislative powers will be exercised by a special congressional committee consisting of 27 people, which cannot be dissolved, until the new convocation.

The recent developments follow a decree to dissolve the country's congress by President Martin Vizcarra after lawmakers boycotted his calls for anti-graft reform.

In a televised address, Vizcarra explained his move as a consequence of lawmakers proceeding with a controversial vote to replace almost all the members of the Constitutional Tribunal.

“We are making history that will be remembered by future generations. And when they do, I hope they understand the magnitude of this fight that we are in today against an endemic evil that has caused much harm to our country,” he said.

In turn, the dissolved legislature declared Vizcarra temporarily unfit to govern and appointed Vice President Mercedes Araoz as acting head of state.

The country's military and police have expressed support for the current president of the country, Martin Vizcarra, the administration of the head of state said on Twitter.

​Earlier this month, lawmakers in the country failed to pass a constitutional reform seeking to hold presidential elections in 2020, a year earlier than scheduled.

The reform was proposed as part of Vizcarra’s anti-corruption drive, in a bid to overcome a political stalemate with right-wing lawmakers.

In June, Peru’s government won a confidence vote in the country’s Congress, avoiding special legislative elections.

As opposition leaders denounced Vizcarra’s moves, Peruvians are anticipated to applaud his decision, writes Time, as new congressional elections were hoped for to replace the majority party, led by former presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of former President Alberto Fujimori, who is now behind bars.

Last year Vizcarra, then vice president, rose to the presidency as he championed anti-corruption initiatives after President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigned in the wake of revelations that his private consulting firm had received secret payments from Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction giant that has confessed to making million-dollar payments to politicians in the Latin American region to secure lucrative public works contracts.

Vizcarra struggled to push legislation through congress, instead repeatedly utilising a “vote of confidence” through which he could threaten to dissolve the legislature if lawmakers didn’t approve his proposals.",Early General Elections in Peru Set For 26 January As Nation Grapples With Political Crisis Fallout,politics,political crisis,465

The Friends star, who actively avoids social media, cropped up online in full party mode, thanks to her Instagram-loving pals Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Hudson.

In the first set of snaps, shared on the Almost Famous star's Instagram, Aniston beamed as she cuddled up to Hudson and Paltrow.

She captioned the post: ""Love these ladies. Celebrated this beauty last night. Happy Bday JA! We all love you sooo!”

The second photobooth clip, shared by Paltrow showed the star letting her hair down as she pulled silly faces alongside Derek Blasberg.

Paltrow hailed Aniston an example of “perpetual goodness” adding that she made 50 look hot.

She wrote: “Happy birthday (last night and tomorrow) to #jenniferaniston our ray of sunshine, example of perpetual goodness. We love you so much and you make 50 LOOK [flames].”

Fans joined in on the praise with many claiming she makes ageing look “beautiful”.

One user wrote: “50?? Omg she looks amazing happy birthday Jennifer Aniston.”

Another commented: “How is she 50???”

A third added: “You make ageing look beautiful and easy.”

Fellow partygoer Katy Perry couldn’t help but mock Aniston’s social media-free rule as she commented on Hudson’s post with, “NO SOCIAL MEDIA.”

Aniston's Friends co-star Courteney Cox and Perry's boyfriend Orlando Bloom were also in attendance.

The comments come as reality star Gemma Collins gushed over Aniston, admitting she has given her the “courage” to embrace not having children by the age she had initially planned.

Speaking on Loose Women, Collins said: “Jennifer Aniston has given me the courage to go, ‘Do you know what, if I don’t have a child until I’m 40-years-old, that’s OK’.

The blaze broke out at the centre in Eccleshall, on March 25, and was caused by a fault in the electrical heating system.

It destroyed three enclosures and volunteers have been working hard to help repair the damage.

Nearly 400 people have donated £6,580 to a GoFundMe page to raise cash. Meanwhile fund raising, such as a Facebook fundraising page, has raised £4,745 and a JustGiving page which was set up by Amy Scholey has also contributed £820 to the funds.

Meaning that over £12,000 has been raised so far for the centre.

Sadly a number of animals died in the blaze - Basil the meerkat died however, his partner Sybil managed to escape and is now searching for a new partner. Other animals that lost their lives in the fire were three giant tortoises and around 15 fruitbats.

The fire left 14 homes nearby without power after power cables were involved in the blaze. A neighbouring Garden Centre was also affected by the loss of power.

Gentleshaw Wildlife Centre posted on their social media, saying: ""Those that have offered help, skills or materials. We will be in touch. Clearing is almost finished. Some trees to be cut back next weekend and then we can get going. Please don't think we aren't utterly grateful for your offers.

""If anyone would like any bark chippings for their garden, feel free to come during opening hours. We've tons! A few pennies in the donation pot and your welcome to as much as you like! No need to contact us, just turn up!

Lesley Smith, Trustee Treasurer for the charity said: ""We are overwhelmed with the support. Obviously we need money to rebuild, but the physical help to clear up and the donations of tea and biscuits for the workers and fruit for the animals is important too.

""Kind words are also helping us to get through this. The fund raising has been amazing. People have been so generous.

At first, her parents brushed off the symptoms - assuming she had a cold or the flu.

""She had cold symptoms. The persistent thing all the way through was a headache, she seemed to always have a headache,"" Mark said.

Ariana, a star student-athlete and artist, had been tested for several viruses, including the kissing disease, at her local GP but nothing was detected.

However, things escalated one evening last week - when the teen began throwing up constantly.

Her parents weren't ""very nervous"" so decided to wait until the next morning to take her to their local hospital.

It was there that Ariana's condition dramatically deteriorated - much to the horror of her parents.

At one point, Ariana tried to stand up to go the bathroom at the hospital, but told her parents she had no feeling in her legs.

Mark told WJAX: ""She felt like her legs were just giving out.""

Doctors believed she was suffering a stroke and had her airlifted to another hospital 35 miles away in Jacksonville.

Mark added: ""Her words were very slurred at times.

""She was just talking gibberish, and the damage was already beginning at that point, which we just didn't know.""

It was at the Jacksonville hospital where medics diagnosed Ariana with the Epstein-Barr virus - which causes the kissing disease.

However, by then, it was too late.

Medics gave Ariana's parents the life-shattering news that the stroke - triggered by mono - had left Ariana with irreparable brain damage.

And just three days later, Ariana passed away.

Mark said: ""Here brain swelled to the point where it couldn't function and brain damage did occur.

""And we just made the decision that it was time to let her go.""

Despite this, Ariana's family were given some comfort after learning her daughter had become an organ donor.

Mark added: ""The doctor actually told us she was an organ donor and we were just, I can’t even describe it.

""We were just like, ‘Wow, that’s her. That sums her up right there'.""

Mark is now urging parents to be vigilant when it comes to their child's health - especially when they first start showing symptoms.

He said: ""In our case, it wasn't enough, but in somebody else's case it may save their life.""

Ariana's parents have started a GoFundMe page in her memory to raise money for their daughter's favourite passions, including music and arts programmes for kids.

As of this morning, the total currently stands at £12,100.

574681,tass,"MOSCOW, December 5. /TASS/. The Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) has carried out 9,098 doping inspections collecting 10,880 samples in January-November 2019, RUSADA Deputy Director Margarita Pakhnotskaya told TASS on Thursday.

According to the Russian anti-doping official, 676 doping inspections were organized in November and 791 doping samples were collected, compared to 613 inspections and 791 collected samples in October and 605 inspections and 727 collected samples in September.

RUSADA Director General Yury Ganus announced to TASS earlier in the year that the national anti-doping agency planned to collect 11,000 doping samples in 2019 and to increase this figure to 13,000 in 2020. The increase in the number of doping samples was planned to be achieved by the cost reduction in logistics and more effective organization of the work.","Russian Anti-Doping Agency carried out up to 9,100 doping tests in Jan.-Nov. 2019",sport,drug use in sport,126
1868,abcnews,"Nashville school district officials say they shouldn't have described two men they say sought student records at a school as ""immigration officials"" without confirming they were.

The acknowledgement still leaves wide uncertainty about what happened at Una Elementary. District officials say they haven't yet found a paper trail or video evidence of the incident, or even pinned down the date it might have occurred.

The prospect of immigration agents seeking records at a school with a big immigrant student population quickly enflamed fears in Nashville, which has seen several high-profile run-ins with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in recent months.

Nashville school district spokeswoman Olivia Brown said the district initially used the term ""immigration officials"" because ""this was the belief of the school staff and district based on the information shared about the incident, but we recognize that this description of the individuals requesting information should not have been shared with the media as a statement of fact without obtaining further confirmation.

""At no time did the district seek to call out this visit and we have made every effort to answer questions honestly and accurately with the information available at the time.""

Mayor John Cooper, who has set up an immigration task force, thinks the incident shows policies involving the city's interactions with federal immigration authorities need an evaluation, including timely documenting and reporting of those interactions, Cooper spokesman Chris Song said.

In an initial statement to reporters last month, the school district had said ""immigration officials"" came to the school. A few days later, the district didn't repeat the term in a statement to media responding to scathing criticism from ICE, which said there was no evidence that its agents visited the school and added that ICE generally does not conduct immigration enforcement at schools.

Instead, the district described ""two men in official-looking uniforms"" ''stating that they were government agents"" with ""official-looking IDs"" who ""had a list of student names and demanded those students' records.""

In between those two statements, an email obtained by The Associated Press through a public records request shows the district chief of staff spoke with Una Elementary Principal Amelia Dukes. He wrote that Dukes told him she never said the incident was immigration-related, and that Dukes described the men as wearing ""military-style outfits.""

Brown says Una Elementary staff haven't been able to recall when it happened, and the district hasn't found video or other records because the date remains uncertain. The district has previously said video footage only goes back a few weeks.

Brown said the school ""took appropriate action"" and the men left when they were told the school couldn't release the information without permission.

The school didn't document the incident, copy their badges or record the men's information, Brown said. Because schools have many visitors, Brown said the visitor log is generally used when visitors enter the main area of the school and is generally not used when visitors only enter the office lobby.

The incident wasn't initially reported to principal supervisors and was brought to district officials' attention during an internal meeting this school year, Brown said. The discussion prompted guidance for schools about responding to requests for student information and training for principals, Brown said.

Asked if any changes will be made in response, Brown answered generally that, ""Going forward, we will continue to engage with our partners to ensure that schools are prepared for how to handle similar types of situations.""",District: Claim of immigration school visit was unconfirmed,society,immigration,561
352200,newswars,"The new telescope paves the way for a more accurate, more focused search for extraterrestrial life, according to researchers.

The study, by a team of astronomers at The Ohio State University, provides the most detailed estimates to date of the potential reach of the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope mission (nicknamed WFIRST.) It was designed by NASA and astronomers throughout the country to find new planets and research dark energy, the mysterious force that pervades otherwise empty space and that could hold the keys to understanding how the universe expands. Their work was published Feb. 25 in the Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series.

“We want to know what kind of planetary systems there are,” said Matthew Penny, lead author of the study and postdoctoral researcher in the Ohio State Department of Astronomy. “To do that, you need to not just look where the obvious, easy things are. You need to look at everything.”

The planets WFIRST is likely to find will be further from their stars than most planets found to date, Penny said. The mission will build on the work of Kepler, a deep-space telescope that found more than 2,600 planets outside our solar system. The Kepler mission ended Oct. 30, 2018.

“Kepler began the search by looking for planets that orbit their stars closer than the Earth is to our Sun,” Penny said. “WFIRST will complete it by finding planets with larger orbits.”

To find new planets, WFIRST will use gravitational microlensing, a technique that relies on the gravity of stars and planets to bend and magnify the light coming from stars that pass behind them from the telescope’s viewpoint.

This microlensing effect, which is connected to Albert Einstein’s Theory of Relativity, allows a telescope to find planets orbiting stars thousands of light-years away from Earth—much farther than other planet-detecting techniques. But because microlensing works only when the gravity of a planet or star bends the light from another star, the effect from any given planet or star is only visible for a few hours once every few million years. WFIRST will spend long stretches of time continuously monitoring 100 million stars at the center of the galaxy.

Penny’s study predicted that about 100 of those not-yet-discovered planets could have the same or lower mass as Earth.

The new telescope will be able to map the Milky Way and other galaxies 100 times faster than the famous Hubble Space Telescope, which was launched in 1990.

The WFIRST mission, with a budget of around $3.2 billion, will scan a small piece of the universe—about 2 square degrees—at a resolution higher than any similar mission in the past. That resolution, Penny said, will allow WFIRST to see more stars and planets than any previous organized search.

“Although it’s a small fraction of the sky, it’s huge compared to what other space telescopes can do,” Penny said. “It’s WFIRST’s unique combination—both a wide field of view and a high resolution—that make it so powerful for microlensing planet searches. Previous space telescopes, including Hubble and James Webb, have had to choose one or the other.”

WFIRST, Penny said, should give astronomers, astrophysicists and others who study space significantly more information about more planets outside of our solar system.

“WFIRST will allow us to find types of planets that we haven’t seen before now,” Penny said. “From WFIRST’s microlensing survey, we will learn how frequently different types of planets are formed, and how unique our solar system is.”

So far, scientists have discovered about almost 700 planetary systems—also known as solar systems—containing more than one planet. And they have discovered some 4,000 planets. But even though humans have searched galaxies near and far for signs of life, the search mostly has found planets that are closer to their stars than Earth is to our Sun.

The “infrared” piece of the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope is also important, Penny said.

“Infrared light allows WFIRST to see through dust that lies in the plane of the Milky Way in between us and the galactic center, something optical telescopes on the ground cannot do,” he said. “This gives WFIRST access to parts of the sky that are more densely packed with stars.”

Ohio State has played an important role in WFIRST, from the project’s inception to the design of research programs the telescope will execute.

The mission is still in the planning stages; NASA announced plans to move forward with WFIRST in February of 2016, and began its initial planning in May of 2018.","New NASA mission could find more than 1,000 planets",science and technology,scientific institution,731
157259,eveningstandard,"There is a lot of confusion when it comes to resistance bands and the best way to incorporate them into your training.

With the ever growing database of online workout videos on Instagram and You Tube, people tend to automatically associate resistance bands with just glute training, while others in large commercial gyms might disregard them altogether as they haven’t been taught proper use.

However, there is a vast selection of resistance bands on the market all with unique and important uses to compliment not only your training, but your recovery too.

Firstly, resistance bands are great to incorporate into your workout for progressing and regressing exercises, which would result in either adding more resistance to make your training harder, or support your bodyweight to take some resistance off and make exercises easier. Not only this, but they are fantastic to warm-up and begin activating specific muscle groups pre-workout.

As a personal trainer before I enter into any sort of strength session, whether that be lower body or upper, I will always start by using resistance bands in my warm up to help mobilise certain areas and then to activate the muscle group I intend on training. Lastly, certain resistance bands can also be used to assist you with post-workout stretches to help lengthen and increase the intensity of the stretch.

A couple of great pre-workout activation exercises you could do are face pulls, which are great for your upper back or monster walks and kick backs to help activate your glutes. Activating muscle groups before a workout is going to help target that specific area to build muscle when you begin lifting.

Although these are more on the expensive side compared to the latex resistance bands, the material is much more durable and the possibility of them breaking is very small. If you use bands or want to incorporate bands into your training frequently then it is worth investing in this thicker fabric set to support you. Super comfortable to wear, these resistance bands avoids any rolling and bunching thanks to the fabric construction. The set of three comes in variable sizes of  12"", 15"" and 17"" and also includes a helpful ebook full of exercises you can start to practice right away.

It is best to buy a pack of resistance bands so you can play around with the different strengths; extra light, light, medium, strong and extra strong. You could even double up when training. For example, you could place the medium band just above your knee and the light or extra light band around your ankles and perform a length of monster walks in your warm up, they will be sure to get your bum on fire. Or you can increase the intensity of simple compound movements, such as a squat by placing a medium or strong band just above the knee.

The only problem with these types of bands is that they can wear and break; however, they are on the affordable side so it doesn’t harm to buy an extra pack just in case.

If you are more of a beginner or new to training this is a great investment on a range of bands for quite an affordable price but the pack also comes equipped with a user guide including 10 functional exercises that you can begin trying right away. The guide will help you with the foundations of basic movements and how to progress and regress them.

Resistance tubes are great to add into your training if you want to switch things up and not use weights. They can make simple movements incredibly challenging and will certainly help improve your strength. I personally love using them for upper body training. One of my favourite exercises I would recommend is the overhead press; stand with your feet on the middle of the band, hip-width apart, hold the handles with both hands and keeping your core engaged, glutes intact, press your arms up, rotating your palms forward as you fully extend and slowly lower back down working to a 2-4 tempo.

A perfect pack for the more hardcore gym goers. The pack includes a set of wrist wraps, which are great protection when you are lifting heavy. To compliment this there are also lifting straps included which can help you to lift heavier when your grip strength gives weight. The resistance band included is great for glute work and the camouflage design makes training certainly makes this one more aesthetically enjoyable.

These bands are very versatile as they come in a lot of different sizes and thickness. They are particularly helpful in calisthenics training to assist and regress harder movements like a pull-up or a press up. You would want to opt for a thicker band at beginner level and slowly move down to the thinner options as you progress until a band is no longer needed at all. Not only that, but these bands are also incorporated into the training of a lot of athletes and professional footballers to help with agility, speed and power.

Although these bands are great for resistance training as you can target both large and small muscle groups at the same time, I personally love to use them for assisted stretches. They are particularly great too if you do any sort of yoga or acrobatic training and need help increasing flexibility.

If you're looking for a no hassle entry to resistance bands the three piece set from  is an excellent option and especially suited to glute strengthening exercises.

104555,cnn,"Roughly 8,700 unaccompanied children were turned over to the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement last month, more than double the number of children compared to the previous April, a senior agency official said, as the swell of migrants at the US-Mexico border continues to strain federal resources.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of the Health and Human Services, is tasked with caring for migrant children who arrive at the border without a parent or guardian. Last April, roughly 4,300 children were referred to the office's care.

Earlier this year, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar notified Congress that the department planned to reallocate up to $385 million for the unaccompanied alien children program. This week, the White House asked for additional funds to increase shelter capacity to accommodate the high number of children.

The overwhelming majority of unaccompanied children are referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement by Customs and Border Protection, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security.

ORR has been preparing for the arrivals of unaccompanied children in its care to double this fiscal year. If current trends hold, referrals of unaccompanied children to the office could surpass the record 2016 figures, when 59,171 minors were referred for care. ""At this point it (would) be close to 2016 and could potentially mark a new record due to more (unaccompanied children) coming across the border,"" an HHS official told CNN in March. Apprehensions of children at the border has been on the rise this year. The US Border Patrol has apprehended 35,898 unaccompanied children so far in fiscal year 2019, according to the most recently available government data. Last year, during the same time period, 21,641 children were taken into Border Patrol custody. Exclusive: DHS to start DNA testing to establish family relationships on the border While the numbers of border apprehensions impact the capacity in HHS facilities, it's not a direct correlation. Still, just as apprehensions fluctuate, so has the number of unaccompanied children in HHS custody over the years. Prior to fiscal year 2012, the number of children sent to the program each year hovered under 8,000. Despite a surge of unaccompanied minors in the summer of 2014, the biggest spike was in fiscal year 2016, when 59,171 children were referred.","Roughly 8,700 unaccompanied children turned over to refugee office last month",society,emigration,376
763031,theindependent,"Liverpool and Chelsea striker Fernando Torres has announced his retirement from football to end an incredible 18-year career.

Torres played an integral role in Spain's golden era, helping them to become European champions and win the World Cup.

The Spaniard announced his intent to speak to the media about his decision at a press conference in Tokyo on Sunday.

“After 18 exciting years, the time has come to put an end to my football career,” the 35-year-old said.

An icon at his boyhood club Atletico Madrid, with more than 100 goals over two spells, Torres burst on to the world scene with a scintillating spell at Liverpool in the Premier League.

His form earned him a big-money move to Chelsea, but he failed to live up to his £50m price tag.

He did contribute to the Blues winning the Champions League, a trophy that would elude him and Atletico Madrid in 2016, losing in the final against bitter rivals Real Madrid.

That came after a brief stint at AC Milan., which again proved disappointing after much fanfare upon his arrival.

He left Atletico in 2018 to join Japan’s Sagan Tosu but has failed to make an impact in the J-League side, scoring just four goals last year and failing to register at all in 2019.

Torres made his Spain debut in 2003 and scored the winning goal in the 2008 European Championship final against Germany before helping his country win their first World Cup in 2010.

He was the top scorer at Euro 2012 as Spain successfully defended their title and scored 38 goals in 110 appearances for his country in total, making him Spain’s country’s third-highest goalscorer behind David Villa (59) and Raul (44).

Torres enjoyed his the most prolific spell at Liverpool between 2007 and 2011, netting 81 goals in 142 games across all competitions.

664946,thedenverpost,"Colorado employers reported having fewer people on the payroll last month, while unemployment rates around the state are dropping like a rock.

One suggests coming weakness while the other continued strength in the labor market. So what is going on?

Nonfarm job counts fell by 1,900 between August and September, the first month-over-month decline measured in the state since September 2018, according to an update Friday from the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment.

Even more unsettling was a revision to August’s monthly gain, which was adjusted from a suspiciously high 9,000 jobs to an anemic 400 jobs. The state added a very robust 10,800 jobs between June and July, only to turn around and shed 1,500 in August and September.

“I’m not seeing any declines,” said Siobahn Moore, who heads the mountain market for Kelly Services, a staffing firm. “It is still a war for talent.”

The issue that the employers Moore works with continue to have is finding enough help, not finding ways to offload the workers they already have.

Despite the drop in payrolls, the unemployment rate, which is based on a separate household survey, fell to 2.7% in September from 2.8% in August, with 3,100 fewer people describing themselves as being without a job and actively looking for one.

That’s on a seasonally adjusted basis. Remove that filter, and the state unemployment rate fell from 2.7% to 2.2%, a decline of 15,259 unemployed workers.

Metro Denver’s unemployment rate went from 2.6% in August to 2.2% in September, while Boulder’s fell from 2.4% to 2%. Colorado Springs went from 3.2% to 2.6%, Fort Collins went from 2.3%c to 1.9%, and Greeley from 2.5% to 2%.

That’s in just one month, and it doesn’t line up with a loss of 1,900 jobs in September.

For the year, the state’s nonfarm payroll count is up by 56,900, and job growth has held steady at 2.1% the past three months.

But half of those gains are concentrated in the business and professional services sector, which is highly unusual, said Broomfield economist Gary Horvath.

Construction hiring is down the past year by 1,000 positions, while information is down by 1,300 and financial activities by 1,800. Even trade transportation and utilities, which includes retail, was trending lower in September

None of those declines, however, are large enough to be statistically significant. Horvath said the construction activity on the street suggests that a decline is unlikely there, and retail looks like it is holding.

Employers are expected to ramp up hiring for the holidays, with the U.S. Postal Service and the Gaylord Rockies hotel joining the host of retailers on the hunt for workers.

If the unemployment rate really is 2.2%, they will have trouble. If other employers are shedding workers, then they might be in luck.","Colorado hiring takes a holiday in September, but unemployment rate falls sharply",labour,unemployment,449
115825,cnsnews,"Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke expressed the deep, heartfelt desire of many progressives: to punish conservative religious people for their beliefs. At a CNN Town Hall on Thursday, he was asked if he believed that “religious institutions like colleges, churches, charities” should “lose their tax-exempt status if they oppose same-sex marriage.”

“Yes,” said O’Rourke, an answer met with raucous applause and loud cheers from the Democratic crowd. “There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone or any institution, any organization in America that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us.”

Although the progressive audience enthusiastically and overwhelmingly supported O’Rourke’s proposal, it was later criticized by legal experts and religious people. Progressive commentators responded by going into damage-control mode. Recognizing that O’Rourke’s proposal might be unpopular with the broader public, commentators aligned with the Democratic Party sought to downplay its significance. They pointed out that O’Rourke is a second-tier presidential candidate with little hope of becoming president.

But O’Rourke’s proposal plainly is popular with the progressive base of the Democratic Party, and other candidates at the CNN Town Hall made no effort to distance themselves from O’Rourke’s position. In response to the same question, Sen. Cory Booker said that religious institutions would face “consequences,” and that he would “press this issue.” Booker avoided “saying” whether he would take away their tax-exemptions, “because … this is a long legal battle.”

Most legal commentators said that O’Rourke’s proposal is unconstitutional under Supreme Court rulings like Speiser v. Randall (1958). Those rulings forbid withholding tax exemptions based on the viewpoint advocated by a person or organization. Such viewpoint discrimination is forbidden by the First Amendment.

But O’Rourke’s unconstitutional proposal plainly appeals to many Democratic voters, judging by their defenses of it on Twitter, and enthusiasm for it at the CNN Town Hall. A Twitter user named Travis Bell defended it by saying:

""Taking away tax-exempt status is not forcing anyone to believe anything. If people wanted to hold outdated, bronze-age beliefs, then that is their right. But we as a society don’t need to subsidize it. Tax-exempt status is a privilege, not a right.""

Bell had plenty of company. An Episcopalian feminist wrote that “churches should lose nonprofit status if they are exclusionary.” “They can continue their backwards beliefs if they want, they just won’t get indirect subsidies anymore,” Miguel Chavez said. “I agree” with Beto, said Sallie Hopper. “Absolutely — religion is not to be used as a crutch to” justify bigotry, said a Louisiana Democratic activist.

A self-described member of “The Resistance” praised O’Rourke’s comments, calling him the “one candidate consistently speaking truth to power.” A Democratic dentist in New Jersey praised O’Rourk, for sending the message to churches “that it’s wrong to have prejudicial views and use the Bible & ‘religious beliefs’ as a veneer to justify them.” “Taking away the tax exempt status of ‘politically motivated’ religions is a great start,” raved Peter Swisher. A New York Democrat enthused that opposing same-sex marriage is one of the “excellent reasons for churches to lose tax-exempt status.” “Finally!! The debasement of human beings according to one’s religion is coming to an end,” agreed a liberal psychologist. “I am with Beto on that,” said a progressive YouTuber.

This position by progressives isn’t surprising. Most progressives support forcing churches to marry gay couples, and long have. Even back in 2013, when support for gay marriage was much lower than it is today, Democrats mostly supported coercing churches to perform gay marriages. A poll by the “center-left” think-tank Third Way found that 28% of voters felt that churches should not “be able to refuse to perform” same-sex marriages, while 61% felt that they should have that right. That 28% amounted to most of the Democratic Party, which comprises less than half of America’s population. And that was back in 2013, when public support for same-sex marriage was at least 14% lower than it is today.

Progressives also often view opposition to same-sex marriage as hate speech. Democrats overwhelmingly want to ban hate speech. Fifty-one percent of Democrats supported banning “hate speech,” while only 21% opposed such a ban, in a widely-cited You.Gov poll. Under campus speech codes and social media rules aimed at preventing hate speech and “harassment,” people have been punished just for criticizing “homosexuality, gay marriage, or transgender rights.”

The Supreme Court struck down a hate-speech ordinance as a violation of the First Amendment in R.A.V. v. St. Paul (1992). But progressives are much more hostile to free speech today than they were back then. So a future, more progressive Supreme Court might be willing to reconsider that decision, which many progressive legal scholars passionately condemned.

Some progressives define even single-instances of “hate speech” as a civil-rights violation: New York City recently warned residents that it may fine them up to $250,000 if they use the term illegal alien in the workplace or rental housing, even if they do so only once. New York City views illegal alien as a pejorative term that constitutes illegal discriminatory harassment when it is uttered to offend or demean such immigrants — even though the term is found in federal laws.

Even if the courts wouldn’t let churches be stripped of their tax exemptions based on their beliefs or statements about same-sex marriage, they might let churches be targeted for some of their actions in not facilitating same-sex weddings. Legal commentator Walter Olson persuasively argues that current Supreme Court precedent does not allow churches to lose their tax exemptions based on refusal to marry gay couples.

But the Supreme Court did allow Bob Jones University to be denied tax-exempt status by the IRS for discrimination against interracial couples, even though interracial relationships were against its religious beliefs. LGBT rights groups cite this ruling to argue that churches can be punished for not recognizing gay marriage in religious schools they operate, or for not hosting same-sex marriage ceremonies in public accommodations such as pavilions that they own. CNN quoted “Camilla Taylor, director of constitutional litigation for Lambda Legal, one of the oldest organizations focused on LGBT rights.” She told CNN, “In the past, the Supreme Court upheld the IRS when they issued a revenue ruling that educational institutions that discriminate on race do not qualify as charitable institutions given that they are acting contrary to public policy.”

In the years to come, LGBT groups will argue that religious schools (and perhaps even churches) do not qualify as tax-exempt charitable institutions, if they don’t recognize gay marriages between their students or parishioners (for purposes of decisions like where to house or seat them). They have already sued religious colleges for not allowin gay couples to live in housing specifically reserved for married students. One such lawsuit was successfully brought by an unmarried gay couple in liberal New York City, over a religious college’s refusal to let them stay in housing for married couples. They objected to being in housing for unmarried students.

Similar challenges to churches over their membership practices are likely to fail. That’s because the Supreme Court’s Bob Jones decision suggested in a footnote that churches are different from religious schools in terms of when they can be denied a tax-exemption based on discrimination.

a fee of 1,000 Swiss francs (over $1,000) before January 11 for his appeal to
be heard in the court.

""Alexander has decided against his appeal with the CAS,"" Mitkov said.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Switzerland’s Lausanne ruled on
December 4 to impose a four-year ban in regard to Russian Olympic curler
Alexander Krushelnitsky citing violations of anti-doping regulations.
According to the court’s ruling, the four-year ban came into force as of
February 12, 2018.

The Swiss-based court announced on December 4 that the decision on the four-
year ban could be appealed within 21 days since the notification of the
athlete at the issue. The Russian athlete submitted documents for the appeal,
but was unable to pay a required fee of 1,000 Swiss francs.

Krushelnitsky won the 2018 Olympic bronze with his wife Anastasia Bryzgalova
in mixed doubles curling at the Winter Games in PyeongChang. On February 18,
it was made public that the athlete tested positive for banned performance
enhancing drug meldonium.

On February 19, the Anti-Doping Division of the Court of Arbitration for Sport
(CAS) opened a case against Krushelnitsky for a doping violation. The CAS
found Krushelnitsky guilty of breaching the anti-doping rules and annulled his
results from the Olympic Games.

Both Krushelnitsky and Bryzgalova were stripped of the bronze medals.

185174,eveningstandard,"A devastated family has spoken of its “heartache and emotional anguish” after their son’s two killers were today convicted of murder at the Old Bailey.

Joshua Boadu, 23, also known as SJ, was killed last year after a brutal stabbing.

He was attacked in broad daylight in Bermondsey, south London, on the evening of June 11.

Mr Boadu managed to flee from his assailants to a nearby home, where emergency services were called.

But the 23-year-old suffered a heart attack on the way to hospital and his life support was turned off 10 days later.

Denilson Davis, 21, and a 16-year-old boy - who cannot be named because of his age - will be sentenced next week.

Mr Boadu's family released a statement following the conviction. It read: ""Words cannot begin to describe how life has been since Josh's passing and he will be forever in our hearts.

“Words cannot describe the heartache and emotional anguish this senseless killing has caused and the impact on the family has been astronomical.

""Josh had his whole life ahead of him and he was full of so much untapped potential but his life was cut short due to a vicious and senseless murder.""

It went on: ""Things will never be the same for us and we have to live with this for the rest of our lives.

""Knowing Josh cannot celebrate another birthday or Christmas brings all the emotion back to us.

“Things that ‘could have been’ are amongst the hardest of things to forget and move forward when you lose a child, brother, uncle and friend like Josh.""

The killers drove to the site of the murder in a Peugeot with a third person who police are still hunting.

Witnesses described how Mr Boadu was ambushed by the trio and tried to defend himself before running away.

After the attack, the murderers fled in the car, and Davis and the boy later tried to call Mr Boadu on the phone.

Police later obtained footage of the killers in a ""celebratory mood"" in a Lewisham recording studio later the same evening.

Less than a week after the attack, police officers noticed the Peugeot and saw the driver running away.

Davis was arrested nearby, and his fingerprints - plus the DNA of the 16-year-old and Mr Boadu's blood - were all found in the car.

A hunting knife and a mobile phone were recovered from the car, and Davis admitted they belonged to him.

Det Insp Ian Titterrell said: “SJ was attacked in broad daylight on a Bermondsey estate, succumbing to his injuries several days later.

“We have never been able to establish a motive for this senseless killing.

""A thorough police investigation by my team, not to mention some great work from borough officers who proactively stopped two cars which yielded vital evidence, has led to today's convictions.

163929,eveningstandard,"In 1994, when she was 25 years old, Jennifer Aniston walked into a coffee shop in a wedding dress and made TV history.

Her role as Rachel Green on Friends would catapult Aniston from jobbing LA actress to international superstar, and the character's witty one-liners, style, work ethic – the spoiled rich kid who started as a waitress and grafted her way up to buyer at Ralph Lauren – and a hairdo that made women go into salons asking for ""The Rachel"" would also influence a generation.

Rachel won Aniston a Golden Globe, a Primetime Emmy and a Screen Actors Guild award. By the final season, Aniston and her co-stars Courtney Cox and Lisa Kudrow, had become the highest paid TV actress of all time.

Then came movie success: The Break-Up, Marley and Me, Horrible Bosses. Her turn as the bereaved Claire Bennett in Cake earned her a Golden Globe nomination, and most recently, she has received critical acclaim for her role as a former beauty queen in Dumplin.

Aniston's private life – so closely scrutinised by the media – has had its fair share of ups, but downs too. There was the highly-publicised estrangement from her mother, Nancy Dow. Her marriage to Brad Pitt, and their subsequent divorce. Her relationships with Vince Vaughn and John Mayer. Her second marriage, to Justin Theroux, and its break down last year.

She might have experienced phenomenal success, but she's also proved she can handle the bumps in the road that have come her way too.

As she turns 50 (her birthday party at the weekend looked like a blast) who better to look to for some solid life advice?

Here, we look back at her best quotes, on life, love, womanhood... and some epic one-liners from Friends.

“Most of us fall in love with someone's persona and spend the next three to five years discovering who that person really is. If you can stay connected through that process of raw vulnerability, I think you have a shot at the prize of knowing and accepting another human being for who and what they really are after years of highs and lows. I've been a real student of this theme for the last 20 years.”

""Here’s where I come out on this topic: we are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child. We get to decide for ourselves what is beautiful when it comes to our bodies. That decision is ours and ours alone. Let’s make that decision for ourselves and for the young women in this world who look to us as examples. Let’s make that decision consciously, outside of the tabloid noise. We don’t need to be married or mothers to be complete. We get to determine our own “happily ever after” for ourselves.""

Addressing speculation over her pregnancy in an essay written for The Huffington Post, 2016

“You know, a swimsuit body is a body in a swimsuit, no matter what that body is. It’s time to just stop thinking beauty is in the shape of a size 4 and the right butt size and the right waist size and the right measurements. It’s just old. We’ve done it. We’ve been there. Let’s move on.”

“I fantasise about it. It really was the greatest job I ever had.”

“Honestly that [haircut] was [on for] about a year, first season. Second season it was gone. So that baby had some legs!”

“There was stuff printed there that was definitely from a time when I was unaware that it was happening. I felt those details were a little inappropriate to discuss. That stuff about how she couldn't wait to get to work every day? That was really uncool.”

“This whole 'Poor lonely Jen' thing, this idea that I'm so unlucky in love? I actually feel I've been unbelievably lucky in love. Just because at this stage my life doesn't have the traditional framework to it—the husband and the two kids and the house in Connecticut—it's mine. It's my experience. And if you don't like the way it looks, then stop looking at it! Because I feel good. I don't feel like I'm supposed to be any further along or somewhere that I'm not. I'm right where I'm supposed to be.”

“Women are picked apart and pitted against one another based on looks and clothing and superficial stuff. When a couple breaks up in Hollywood, it’s the woman who is scorned. The woman is left sad and alone. She’s the failure. F that. When was the last time you read about a divorced, childless man referred to as a spinster?”

“People forget who actors are. They say, 'You're too known to play that part. You can't disappear.' And we're like, 'Give us a chance. We'll disappear.'”

“I never liked Sex and the City, the kind of thing where women only feel empowered once they find the man. It is just not up my alley. I don't believe in it. There is nothing you can control about love. Somebody once said, 'Everything you want in the world is just right outside your comfort zone. Everythingyoucouldpossiblywant!'”

“People who avoid the brick walls — all power to ya, but we all have to hit them sometimes in order to push through to the next level, to evolve.”

“I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?”

“Oh, I'm sorry. Did my back hurt your knife?”

“I am – over – you. And that, my friend, is what they call 'closure'”

“I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we’re gonna be all like 'Oh everybody, let’s take our helicopters up to the cape' and you’re gonna be all like 'oh, I can’t guys, I’ll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai'”

“It's not that common, it doesn't happen to every guy, and it is a big deal.”

“Oh that's ok, girls tend not to like me”

68434,birminghammail,"A lone-wolf terrorist who launched a frenzied knife attack on commuters and police at Manchester Victoria railway station last New Year's Eve has pleaded guilty to attempted murder.

Mahdi Mohamud, 26, raised the fillet knife and walked up behind unsuspecting James Knox, screaming ""Allahu Akbar!"" and ""Long live the Caliphate!"" as he stabbed his victim repeatedly in the back, shoulders and head.

He then turned the knife on Mr Knox's companion, Anna Charlton, slashing her across the face after the couple, in their 50s, randomly crossed his path heading for a tram platform shortly before 9pm last December 31.

British Transport Police (BTP) officers heard a blood-curdling scream and dashed to the scene.

Pcs Ashleigh Williams, 27, and her colleague Marsha Selby, 28, along with two tram staff confronted Mohamud, who ""like an animal"" was ""fixated"" on stabbing and slashing, witnesses said.

The suspect was pepper sprayed before seconds later Pc Tom Wright, 27, arrived along with Sergeant Lee Valentine, 31, who shot Mohamud with his Taser.

But the barbs of the 50,000 volt shock gun got stuck in the knifeman's thick coat and failed to paralyse him.

Before he could reload the knifeman ran along the blood-spattered platform charging at the officers with the weapon.

Sgt Valentine was stabbed in the shoulder before the suspect was wrestled to the ground and arrested.

A second kitchen knife was found in his waistband.

Mr Knox suffered 13 injuries including a skull fracture while Ms Charlton's right lung was punctured and she suffered a slash to her forehead that cut down to the bone.

The defendant, a Dutch national from a Somali family, had arrived in the UK aged nine and became radicalised online, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said.

Detained under the Mental Health Act the day after the attack he was later found fit to stand trial.

Mohamud pleaded guilty at Manchester Crown Court on Tuesday to three counts of attempted murder.

He also admitted one count of the possession of a document or record likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, a manual titled, ""the seven most lethal ways to strike with a knife"".

193318,eveningstandard,"A yellow weather warning has been issued with gusts of up to 70mph expected to batter parts of the UK this week.

High winds are being forecast to hit Northern Ireland, Wales and western parts of Scotland and England throughout Wednesday night and into Thursday.

Exposed coastal areas will bear the brunt of the gales with inland areas ""likely to see wind gusts peak between 45mph and 55mph"".

Forecasters are warning of the potential for transport disruption with the winds likely to affect road, rail, air and ferry transport, and may also cause some short-term loss of power.

But what is a yellow weather warning? And how does it differ from amber and red? The Standard takes a look.

According to the Met Office, yellow warnings are issued when incoming weather is expected to cause ""low level impacts"", but not to the same extent of amber or red warnings.

Issued for a range of different weather situations, some travel disruption is expected and some people will be directly impacted by it. However, the Met Office says most people ""may be able to continue with their daily routine"" - so it's important to assess if the weather will affect you.

Sometimes, yellow warnings are issued when the weather is expected to to bring more severe impacts to most people but the likelihood of those impacts actually happening is much lower.

The Met Office adds: ""It is important to read the content of yellow warnings to determine which weather situation is being covered by the yellow warning.""

Remember to check the content of the warning to determine what type of weather is being covered.

How does a yellow weather warning differ from amber and red?

Weather warnings are issued when bad weather is expected to impact the UK. The Met Office says the warnings are given colour from yellow to amber and red, which depends on a combination of the severity of the weather and the likelihood it is to happen.

An amber warning is a step on from yellow and means the likelihood that more severe weather is expected is higher. During an amber warning, people are advised to change their plans and take steps to protect themselves and their property.

The weather could cause travel delays, road and rail closures and power cuts. According to the Met Office, the public is advised to ""consider the impact of the weather on your family and your community and whether there is anything you need to do ahead of the severe weather to minimise the impact"".

A red warning is the most severe and means dangerous weather is expected. The Met Office says ""you should take action now to keep yourself and others safe from the impact of severe weather"".

People are advised to avoid travelling at all as there is a risk to life during this kind of weather. Travel and energy supplies will face widespread disruption while there is the possibility of widespread damage to property and infrastructure.

712775,theguardianuk,"Workers downed tools, shops closed and activists blocked roads in Catalonia on Friday in a general strike called in protest at the jailing of nine pro-independence leaders over their roles in the failed push for secession two years ago.

Tens of thousands of people who have marched from across the region began converging in Barcelona on Friday afternoon to protest against the Spanish supreme court’s verdict and to call for the leaders to be freed.

Their presence brought the city to a standstill before a massive demonstration that began at 5pm local time.

The entrance to the Catalan capital’s most famous landmark – the Sagrada Familia church – was blocked by pro-independence protesters and 57 flights were cancelled at Barcelona-El Prat airport.

On Friday morning, the Spanish football federation announced that the Barcelona-Real Madrid game due to be played in the Catalan capital on 26 October had been postponed because of the unrest.

During the afternoon the atmosphere in the city was quiet and there were few incidents. However, there were police charges and two arrests on Via Laietana, one of the city’s main thoroughfares, after objects were thrown at officers guarding the headquarters of the national force by a large crowd of students.

Marchers entering Barcelona were also pelted with stones as they passed through the working-class neighbourhood of Santa Coloma de Gramenet.

The militant Committees for the Defence of the Republic (CDR) called for an indefinite protest camp to be set up at the key city centre junction of Gran Via and Passeig de Gràcia as of 6pm on Friday. Blocking this junction would paralyse traffic across a large swathe of the city.

Meanwhile a judge at Spain’s highest criminal court, the Audiencia Nacional, ordered police to shut down the website and social media accounts of Tsunami Democràtic, the pro-independence organisation that has used apps to co-ordinate and control protests. The group was behind Monday’s attempts to occupy Barcelona airport.

Peaceful protests, which have long been the hallmark of the pro-independence movement, have been eclipsed this week by violent unrest and running battles between protesters and police.

Barcelona had its worst night of violence on Thursday as pro-independence supporters clashed with police and rightwing groups in skirmishes that lasted into Friday morning.

After another large demonstration broke up, protesters fought police, throwing stones and at least one petrol bomb in an apparent attempt to reach the seat of the Spanish government in the city. A clothing shop was set on fire and a bank vandalised.

One pro-independence protester was badly beaten by a group of rightwing supporters while once again the streets were acrid with the smell of bonfires of burning rubbish. Numerous injuries were reported.

As the unrest continued, Catalan TV and the main Barcelona TV channel ceased broadcasting news, as did at least one of the online dailies, in support of the general strike.

The supreme court’s decision to jail the nine leaders for secession and misuse of public funds over their roles in the failed push for independence has provoked uproar among many Catalans.

Among those heading towards Barcelona on Friday morning was Anna Parella, a hospital worker from the coastal town of Calella. She had joined the march with colleagues to call for independence and the release of the jailed leaders.

“A lot of people have joined us as we’ve gone along and the mood is really nice and festive,” said Parella.

She said the marchers were all peaceful but added that some people had grown sick of the situation and begun to go about things the wrong way.

“I’m against the violence and we can’t have people starting to think we’re all violent,” she said. “Our calls will lose their force if they do.”

Also on Friday, Carles Puigdemont, the former Catalan president who led the failed bid for independence two years ago, handed himself in to judicial authorities in Belgium in response to the reactivation of an international arrest warrant against him this week. His extradition hearing has been scheduled for 29 October.

Catalonia’s pro-independence regional president, Quim Torra, has been criticised for being slow to condemn the violence – and for calling for civil disobedience while sending in Catalan riot police to restore order.

Speaking on Friday morning, Spain’s interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, said 16 people had been arrested overnight and 10 police officers injured. He repeated the government’s assertion that while people had a right to protest, any violence would be dealt with firmly.

Asked about reports that violent groups from the Basque country, France and Germany were planning to travel to Catalonia to take part in any forthcoming disturbances, he said such participation had already been anticipated by the authorities.

“We know that these kinds of radical, violent people – people with varying ideologies – have been present in Catalonia, particularly Barcelona,” he said.

“They tend to turn up for the kind of events we’re seeing in Barcelona.”

Reports have already emerged of some of the violent protesters speaking neither Catalan nor Spanish.

Despite the simmering tensions, Torra has suggested that another unilateral referendum on Catalan independence should be held.

“If we have been sentenced to 100 years in prison for putting out the ballot boxes, the response is clear: we’ll have to put them out again for self-determination,” he told the regional parliament on Thursday.",Catalonia general strike brings Barcelona to standstill,"conflict, war and peace",civil unrest,860

It seems like a bad idea to us, but maybe our Catholic readers will see it differently.

This came up in the same speech that raised eyebrows for what the Pope said about politicians denouncing homosexuality being like Hitler.

Pope Francis, who has made the environment a signature cause of his pontificate, said he was strongly considering adding the category of “ecological sin” to the Catholic Church’s official compendium of teachings.

Trending: Hilarious: Anderson Cooper Gets Blasted By Seb Gorka … On His Own Show! (Video)

“We must introduce—we are thinking—into the Catechism of the Catholic Church the sin against ecology, the ecological sin against the common home, because it’s a duty,” the pope said at the Vatican Friday.

He noted that ecological sin would be defined as an “action or omission against God, against others, the community and the environment. It is a sin against future generations and is manifested in the acts and habits of pollution and destruction of the harmony of the environment.”

In the same speech he said that developments in politics and business remind him of dark episodes from humanity’s past, including Adolf Hitler’s Third Reich.

“It is not coincidental that at times there is a resurgence of symbols typical of Nazism,” Francis said as he decried the “culture of waste and hate” represented by contemporary politicians who spew derogatory and racists attacks against homosexuals, gypsies, Jewish people, and others. “I must confess to you,” he continued, “that when I hear a speech (by) someone responsible for order or for a government, I think of speeches by Hitler in 1934, 1936.”

Francis also blamed global capitalism for ‘plundering the earth’ at the expense of the poor and future generations.

“Global financial capital is at the origin of serious crimes not only against property but also against people and the environment,” Francis said, comparing capitalism to “organized crime” committing “ecocide.” Francis added that such crimes committed by corporations should be punished.

337135,naturalnews,"(Natural News) The collaboration between muscles and tendons is important for facilitating animal movement. Muscles are contractile tissues whose function is to produce force and motion. What keeps muscles in place and attaches them to the bones is a strong and flexible connective tissue called tendon.

Muscles and tendons are connected to each other by attachments, which are designed to withstand high amounts of mechanical forces throughout an animal’s lifetime. In a study published in PLOS Biology, researchers from the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Germany investigated how these mechanical forces are sensed and transmitted in an intact organism. Using Drosophila (fruit fly) as their experimental model, they quantified the mechanical forces transmitted by talin, an essential integrin-binding protein. They found that despite being abundantly present in muscle-tendon attachments, only a small portion of talin molecules deal with mechanical forces at the same time. These molecules, however, dynamically share the mechanical load to provide support and stability to muscle-tendon attachments.

During the early stages of development, the cells of an organism are subjected to various mechanical forces that eventually dictate cell fate. To help them sense and resist these forces, cells rely on integrin-based adhesions, which serve as their core force-sensing structures.

Integrins are cell-surface proteins that act as receptors. One of their main functions is to regulate the interaction of individual cells with their microenvironment to control cell fate. Integrins are attached to one end of the protein talin, which connects it to the actin-myosin cytoskeleton.

Actin is an integral part of the cytoskeleton that gives cells their structure and shape. Myosin, on the other hand, is a motor protein involved in cell motility. The interaction between these two proteins is what makes muscle contraction possible.

The position of talin — sandwiched between integrin and actin — gives it the perfect opportunity to process mechanical forces at the molecular level. Talin is not only important for stabilizing integrin-based adhesion, it also mediates cell signaling through its attachment to integrin, actin, and other proteins.

To determine how mechanical forces that influence cell fate are sensed and transmitted, the researchers studied the muscle attachment sites of fruit flies. These sites are subjected to high mechanical forces during development. The muscles in these sites also rely on integrin-mediated adhesion to connect them stably to tendons. (Related: Scientists find way to create working muscles from handful of skin cells in lab setting.)

The researchers generated fruit flies with built-in talin tension sensors to allow them to measure relevant molecular forces experienced by the protein. They found that talins in fruit flies encounter the same mechanical forces in vitro as talins in mammalian cell cultures. However, talin molecules operate differently in vivo.

The researchers discovered that, in live fruit flies, as muscle-tendon attachments mature, the forces across talin molecules decrease even while tissue-level tension remains high. Talin also increases in concentration at attachment sites, but only a small portion (less than 15 percent) is engaged by mechanical forces at any given time.

When the researchers reduced the concentration of talin at the later stages of muscle development, muscle-tendon attachments in adult flies ended up rupturing under the pressure exerted by muscle contractions. This demonstrated the importance of high levels of talin in maintaining stable muscle-tendon attachments. It also demonstrated how individual talin molecules work together and share high mechanical loads to fulfill their function.

“This mechanical adaptation concept ensures that muscle-tendon connections can last for life,” explained Sandra Lemke, one of the authors of the study.

Lemke and her team also believe that their findings show how cells can adapt to changes in tissue mechanics to prevent mechanical failure in vivo.",Biologists identify the protein that makes tendon-muscle connections last a lifetime,science and technology,biomedical science,651

431139,prisonplanet,"– The emails were sent to Infowars by a third party

 – The FBI’s investigation is treating Jones as the victim

 – The mass media ran a giant hoax claiming Jones sent the emails to Sandy Hook lawyers

 – The emails ended up in a spam folder and were never opened by Infowars staff

 – The emails sent to Infowars were “very hostile” and contained threats against Jones

 – Plaintiff’s lawyers in the Sandy Hook case tried to subpoena 9.6 million emails

 – Unopened emails did not say they contained child porn

 – The entire farce was likely a set-up to frame Jones

 – Jones has offered a $1 million dollar reward to find the perpetrator

The mass media ran a giant hoax claiming Alex Jones had sent child porn to Sandy Hook lawyers when in fact Jones himself was a victim of a third party sending him malware which contained child porn.

The entire farce clearly looks like a set-up intended to frame Jones. Here’s what actually happened;

As part of discovery, the judge in the Sandy Hook case initially ordered Infowars to turn over an archive of 9.6 million emails received since 2012.

Having subsequently accepted that this was an impossible task, the judge clarified that Infowars only had to turn over emails that mentioned Sandy Hook terms or the names of victims.

57,000 emails were turned over to the court, out of which 12 emails contained images of child porn. These emails went into a spam filter and nobody at Infowars opened the emails or the attachments (doing so would have been a crime). The emails did not state that they contained child porn. Only after the Sandy Hook lawyers subpoenaed the emails was the porn discovered.

When Sandy Hook lawyers found these emails as part of discovery, they turned them over to the FBI in late May and the FBI began an investigation.

According to Jones’ attorney Norman Pattis, the FBI is treating Jones as the victim because the malicious emails were sent to him by a third party and were “very hostile” towards Jones.

“There were 9.6 million emails that were searched; we turned over about 57,000 of them. In 12 of them, there were embedded images of child pornography,” Pattis said. “As it turns out, those emails were never opened, the images were never opened. There’s no evidence that anybody here, or anybody affiliated with you, or you, ever searched them. So clearly they were placed in there as malware.”

“I’ve spoken to federal prosecutors, they regard you as a victim. They do not regard you in any way as a suspect,” he added.

“I spoke to federal prosecutors last week. They report that there is no indication anyone at InfoWars knowingly possessed child pornography,” said Pattis.

Indeed, the emails did not indicate that they contained child porn and were not opened by any Infowars staff. This clearly suggests that the emails were an attempt to set-up Jones and Infowars for possession of child porn.

Despite the media acknowledging in early reports that Jones was the victim, reporting that he had offered a $1 million reward to find the culprit who sent the emails, two days later the press began running fake news headlines claiming Jones had sent the emails to Sandy Hook lawyers, which is completely false.

The fact that the media would run a complete hoax in claiming Jones had sent child porn when in fact he was the victim because the emails were sent to him is particularly egregious, but par for the course given that the profession of journalism is now controlled by far-left activists who abuse their power to ruin people’s lives.

One newspaper, the Hartford Courant, actually reported the truth when it stated, “The FBI has informed Alex Jones someone planted child pornography on the servers for his Infowars website” and that the emails “appeared to be threats against Jones but actually contained child pornography.”

Sandy Hook attorneys accused Jones of failing to perform “minimal due diligence” by refusing to open the child porn attachments. Doing so would have been a crime, and at no point did anyone at Infowars even open the emails.

Another lawyer acting on behalf of Jones, Robert Barnes, also commented on the matter.

“FBI confirmed Jones was VICTIM of malware sent to him he never opened, that lawyers found from court discovery opening up all attachments of all emails ever sent to him,” said Barnes, adding, “I’m wide awake in Vegas & will be suing libelers.”

“When even the Jones-haters detail how #AlexJones was the VICTIM of malware, then you know how bad the libel is from the rest of the press. Shouldn’t that cause people to ask: what else are they lying about concerning #AlexJones?” he added, highlighting a tweet by trial lawyer Max Kennerly.

“It does not appear (Jones) was knowingly involved in possessing child pornography. Rather, someone emailed it unsolicited to an InfoWars address,” said Kennerly.

365736,newyorker,"Rafi Peretz, Israel’s new Education Minister, recently gave his first major television interview. Peretz, a former chief military rabbi and the founder of a military-preparatory academy in the Gaza Strip, belongs to a far-right alliance of parties and is a newcomer to politics. In the interview, Peretz was flushed and visibly nervous. He couldn’t stop smiling.

“Let’s talk about the L.G.B.T. community,” his interviewer, Dana Weiss, said at one point. Peretz was clearly caught off guard. He replied that he respected all people, but that “our Torah teaches us differently.” Weiss asked, “Do you support conversion therapy? Do you believe it’s possible to convert people’s sexual orientation?” By now Peretz’s smile had completely vanished. “I think it’s possible,” he said. “I can tell you I have a deep familiarity with this type of education, and I’ve also done it.” He went on to describe how he had counselled a student. “The objective is that, first of all, he should know himself well,” he said. “And then he will decide.”

Later in the interview, Peretz said that he wanted to “extend Israeli sovereignty to the entirety of Judea and Samaria”—to fully occupy the West Bank—without giving Palestinians any voting rights. It is saying something about how far to the right Israeli society has moved that this comment earned little notice. But Peretz’s embrace of conversion therapy proved too much for mainstream Israelis to stomach. After the interview aired, hundreds protested in front of the government’s Tel Aviv offices, holding signs with Biblical quotes about love and acceptance. Three thousand teachers threatened to strike. Thousands of parents around the country signed a petition stating that Peretz “shouldn’t be a minister of anything.” Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, moved quickly to disavow Peretz’s comments on conversion therapy, calling them “unacceptable.” But he didn’t fire the man he had entrusted with the education of Israel’s children.

Unlike the United States, which enshrined separation of church and state in its Constitution, Israel is defined, in its basic law, as a “Jewish and democratic state”—a muddled term that breeds near-constant battle over its meaning. Since its founding, Israel has had to rely on a series of fragile compromises between its secular leadership and its religious community. A letter known as the status-quo agreement, signed, in 1947, by David Ben-Gurion, who went on to become Israel’s first Prime Minister, guaranteed basic religious tenets, such as observance of Shabbat, while insuring that Israel would not become a Jewish theocracy. Marriage, divorce, and burial have, since the country’s founding, been under the auspices of Israel’s Chief Rabbinate. But on matters relating to the work force, military, universities, or public schools, there has been a clear separation between religion and state.

In the past decade, since Netanyahu came into power, Israeli society has undergone a process so transformative that a new Hebrew word had to be brought into use for it: “hadata,” or “religionization.” Manifestations of hadata appear throughout civic life. On some public buses that pass through ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods, women have been forced to sit in the back, for reasons of “modesty.” In the military, female soldiers are officially given the same opportunities as males, but the presence of just one religious male soldier in a unit can prevent female soldiers from serving there. Such discrimination is often done in the name of supposed inclusiveness: in order to accommodate the strictures of observant Jews, certain adjustments have to be made. Yet those called on to “adjust” are almost always women or members of the L.G.B.T. community. Just this week, Israel's attorney general said that cities could enforce gender segregation at public events, adding that “the justification for the separation is greater if the events are attended by a public that desires to be separated.”

Nowhere have those changes been more pronounced or more influential than in the public-school system, where the values of the Jewish Home Party and its far-right allies have taken hold. The Education Minister controls funding to Israel’s two systems of public schools, a religious system and a non-religious one, as well as its ultra-Orthodox schools, Arab and Druze schools, universities, and colleges. According to a 2017 investigation by the liberal think tank Molad, classes in Jewish education received a hundred and nineteen times more funding than those having to do with democracy or coexistence. Whereas schools used to promote a pluralistic approach to Judaism, with weight given to the Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox movements, much of the curriculum these days is being taught through the narrow prism of religious orthodoxy. And the emphasis on Jewish studies insures that other content is pushed out. Naftali Bennett, the former leader of the Jewish Home Party and the Education Minister before Peretz, said as much, in 2016: “Learning Judaism and excelling in it is more important, in my opinion, than learning math or science.”

Religious organizations have likewise mushroomed in the country in recent years, a result of generous state budgets that increased with time—more than doubling between 2007 and 2017. Representatives of these organizations have taken to teaching classes—often for free—in the school system, an offer that is too tempting for many administrators to pass up. “It started with, ‘Let us teach them the Jewish holidays, because you don’t know anything about it,’ ” Ram Vromen, a Tel Aviv businessman and the founder of a nonprofit group called Secular Forum, which tracks religious content in public schools, told me. “It quickly escalated to them teaching bar-mitzvah-preparation classes, classes in family values, and even leading discussions about the assassination of [the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak] Rabin.”

Vromen started the secular forum in 2011, and focussed on the school system after he saw a handout that was given to his daughter in her third-grade reading-comprehension class. “It described a guy called Suleiman who is Jewish and living in some Arab city,” Vromen told me. A pogrom is about to take place just before Shabbat and everyone decides to flee. Nobody stops for Shabbat except for Suleiman and his family, “who are very observant and decide that honoring the Shabbat is more important.” Those who continue to flee are later massacred, and only Suleiman and his family are spared, because of their religious fervor. “Then there were questions like, ‘How do you observe the Shabbat in your own home?’ ” Vromen recalled. Among the accounts collected by Vromen’s group is a science textbook that includes a prayer for rain.

“You can’t examine these cases individually,” Vromen said. “You have to look at them as a whole. And when you do you see that there’s a clear attempt to change the face and character of Israeli society.” There was a father who reported that his six-year-old daughter’s preschool had taken a trip to a synagogue and received fliers that read, “the people of Israel must study the Torah or else they don’t feel truly alive.” There was a mother whose eighth-grade daughter’s homework included the imperative to “Spell out nineteen times ‘Baruch Ata Adonai’ ”—the beginning of a Jewish blessing. Religious content, it turned out, ran deeper than that. “Learning history now matters only inasmuch as it relates to Jewish history,” Vromen said. “So that, if the First World War has no real connection to the Jewish people, they barely teach it.”

In 2017, a video of a ninth-grade student named Hilli from Tel Aviv made headlines. In it, Hilli addresses the “Dear Education Minister,” Bennett, with a confidence that belies her age. She recounts sitting in a class on Israeli culture when the teacher began describing the life paths of Israeli men and women. “A man’s path begins with a bris, through school, bar mitzvah, Army, university, marriage, and children,” Hilli quotes her teacher as saying. And a woman’s? “School, Army, marriage and children,” she says. Women, Hilli is left to conclude, “apparently skip university, because it’s more important to change diapers and make lunch.” She says, “As a secular girl, the education system simply erases me.”

When I was a student in Jerusalem, in the late nineteen-eighties and nineties, we celebrated the Jewish holidays in school, but no teacher asked us how, or if, we observed them at home. We welcomed the Shabbat with song but not with prayer, and certainly not with the full ritual of candle-lighting, Kiddush, and head cover that has become the norm across (nonreligious) kindergartens all over the country. There was a sense that Jewish culture contained a multitude of interpretations, with no one inherently better than the other, and that schools were there to provide anchor, not judgment.

Yael (Yuli) Tamir, a former Labor Party lawmaker, was the last liberal Education Minister, serving between 2006 and 2009. She told me that during her term there had already been pressure from the religious right to have a greater say in the way that the nonreligious public-school system was run. “There isn’t a country in the world that doesn’t want to teach some kind of cultural heritage,” she said. “But the question is when that turns into indoctrination.”

Tamir said that she fought to preserve the nonreligious system as distinct from the religious one. It was important to her that students learn about the Palestinian nakba (“catastrophe”), for example, when reading about Israel’s War of Independence, and that they be able to grapple intellectually with different, and at times contradictory, narratives. “The nonreligious system takes as a paradigm Israel’s existence as a Jewish and democratic country, with all of the complexities involved,” she said. “The religious system, on the other hand, is faith-based, and argues that we’re in this country because of God. It’s seemingly semantic—they’re not throwing anyone in jail; they’re not enforcing burkas on anyone—but the distance between that and theocracy is small, and getting smaller.”",How the Religious Right Transformed Israeli Education,religion and belief,religious text,1610
1031868,thevaccinereaction,"What happens when our government regulatory agencies tasked with protecting the public’s health fails to disclose the risks known by the industry?

In the case of viruses and DNA in vaccines, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has internally noted1 that “small amounts of residual cell substrate DNA unavoidably occur in all viral vaccines as well as other biologics produced using cell substrates. There are several potential ways DNA could be a risk factor. DNA can be oncogenic or infectious; in addition, it can cause insertion mutagenesis through integration into the host genome.”

Since all vaccines contain residual DNA that has a potential to be oncogenic (causing cancer), mutagenic (changing your genetic code), and infectious, isn’t it of major concern that section 13 of every vaccine package insert2 states that the product has not been evaluated for carcinogenic (causing cancer) or mutagenic effects?

The FDA continues3: “The use of human tumor-derived cell lines poses added safety concerns regarding the potential presence of unexpected and unknown viruses. These include viruses that may be present in the cell line due to their existence in the patient tissue such as oncogenic, latent DNA viruses (e.g., adenovirus, hepadenoviruses, herpesviruses, papillomaviruses, polyomaviruses) and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), which exist normally in a quiescent state in the host cell DNA of all species…”

This suggests that these viruses are sleeping and inactive, currently not expressing, and have the full potential to cause infection if they are woken from this sleep. These quiet and sleeping viruses can only be detected in the cells used to make vaccines if they are activated making their presence; and then their detection is quite problematic. This is an issue for all cell strains used to make vaccines and is not unique to human tumorigenic cells.

Genetic engineer Dr. Theresa Deisher, a PhD in Molecular and Cellular Physiology from Stanford University with over 20 years experience in biotechnology, reports that “not only damaged human cells, but also healthy human cells can take up foreign DNA spontaneously. Foreign human DNA taken up by human cells will be transported into nuclei and be integrated into host genome, which will cause phenotype change.”

So here we have proof that the human DNA in the following vaccines has the potential to cause genetic changes in every child who receives them:

According the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and depending on the products used, a child has the potential to receive up to six separate injections that contain residual human DNA by the time they are two years old.

The FDA goes on to discuss the safety aspect of residual DNA in vaccines: Dr. Peden, Chief of the Laboratory of DNA Viruses at the FDA, states that “it depends on the mechanism of transformation. For example, mutations, chromosome rearrangements, translocations, retrotranspositions, etc., all involve DNA. Therefore, reducing the size and amount of the DNA should mitigate this risk” (bold emphasis added).

The conclusion that DNA size will reduce the risk of mutagenesis and infection is based on nothing more than a belief. Research shows us4 that in mammals, such as humans, the genetic code is highly repetitive, meaning it is homologous (similar in structure). Small fragments of DNA are used to achieve genetic modification in a therapeutic manner. It is not much of a stretch to assume this same observation occurs in a non-therapeutic manner as well: “Homologous Replacement is used to modify specific gene sequences of chromosomal DNA in a process referred to as ‘Small Fragment Homologous Replacement’, where DNA fragments replace genomic target resulting in specific sequence changes.”

Studies show that it is a matter of an individual’s genetics5 that increases their risk and susceptibility to the infectious nature of DNA and insertion mutagenesis (bold emphasis added):

“Residual DNA (rDNA) is comprised of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragments and longer length molecules originating from the host organism that may be present in samples from recombinant biological processes. Although similar in basic structural base pair units, rDNA may exist in different sizes and physical forms. Interest in measuring rDNA in recombinant products is based primarily on demonstration of effective purification during manufacturing, but also on some hypothetical concerns that, in rare cases, depending on the host expression system, some DNA sequences may be potentially infectious or oncogenic (e.g., HIV virus and the Ras oncogene, respectively).”

Dr. Peden goes on to say that “in primary cells and diploid cells there are no limits for the amount of DNA in vaccines”. That means these safety measures to limit the amount of residual DNA does not apply to live virus vaccines grown in human diploid cells such as the MMR and varicella.

In addition to the abomination of genetically modifying our children through insertion mutagenesis of male and female human diploid cell strain DNA without disclosure, is the other elephant in the room: the presence of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) that was found in MMRII and VARIVAX.6 It is important to note it was the WI-38 and MRC-5 cell strains that contain this contaminant and as such, any and all products used with these cell lines will contain HERV-K.

Human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) is associated with a myriad of chronic disease states7: “Several mechanisms by which HERVs could produce pathological effects have been proposed, including generation of new variants of HERVs, insertional mutagenesis, and protein toxicity. In this regard, HERV activation appears to influence the aggressiveness of different cancers, including seminoma, melanoma, leukemia, hepatocellular carcinoma, sarcoma, prostate, breast and colon cancer. Likewise, the pathologic process of rheumatic disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psoriasis, type I diabetes, and systemic sclerosis shows a correlation with HERV activity.”

Childhood cancers8 are on the rise and we cannot underestimate the role directly injecting HERV-K has on this observation. Especially when it is directly associated with leukemia9 as can be seen here: “In patients with leukemia, the presence of antibodies against HERV-K has been identified, which could suggest increased expression of HERV-K in leukemic cells.”

And here10: “Antibody response against HERV-K peptides has been reported in leukemia patients, suggesting a possible over-expression of this sequence in leukemic cells.”

Here we see that herpesviruses are shown to reactivate HERV,11 “Herpesviruses may also be a significant trigger of HERV expression in the CNS. Multiple reports have detected EBV, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6) in MS patient samples; all these herpesviruses have also been demonstrated to trigger the expression of HERVs.”

It should be highly concerning to all that we find HERV-K in the presence of a live herpesvirus, as is the case with VARIVAX (varicella-zoster).

Given the above information, it seems that all vaccines are inherently dangerous and each individual, not a government agency, should be making their own risk-to-benefit analysis for using these products. It also means that we are all participating in an experiment to which we did not consent and from which we are still learning about the unintended consequences of consuming such products. It is not a secret—although rarely discussed by various media outlets and medical professionals we entrust with our children—that the infections we have vaccines for were acute, self-limited, common, childhood infections, as can be seen here in this very well-researched article.12

Prior to vaccination your risk of dying from these infections was still less than your risk of dying from a lightning strike, choking, or falling in the shower. It was uncommon for a child to experience an adverse outcome from these infections. Just like it is uncommon for a child to experience an adverse outcome with vaccination, perhaps we have exchanged one genetically susceptible child with another?

Dr. James Lyons-Weiler said it best13: “If we as a society enjoy collective benefit from protection from infectious diseases due to vaccines, then we as a society share the collective responsibility to protect those who are the greatest risk of harm from vaccines. Enough with the propaganda that says there is no risk; enough. Genetics and careful attention to reliable risk factors will play a fundamental role in protecting those among us who are most susceptible…”.

Now that 54% of our children14 suffer from at least one of 20 chronic illnesses, including neurodevelopmental disorders, seizure disorders, severe allergies, autoimmune conditions, and cancer, we begin to realize that if you have a healthy child you are now a minority. Perhaps it is time to return to our roots and embrace natural medicines. Perhaps it is time to stop putting faith in pharmaceuticals and the doctors who exclusively prescribe them. Perhaps it is time we separate pharma and state.

File photo shows Iraq’s ambassador to Iran Sa’ad Jawad Qandil.

**Iraq’s ambassador to Iran says the Arab country dearly needs Tehran’s
economic and technical support as it seeks to rebuild territories ravaged by
Daesh terrorists while insisting that US pressure would fail to break the
intimate bonds between the two neighbors.**

“Huge damage was inflicted on Iraq during the time of Daesh and we need Iran’s
contribution to reverse the damage,” said Sa’ad Jawad Qandil while addressing
a trade conference in Tehran on Saturday.

Qandil said US economic sanctions on Iran would be no deterrent to Iraq and
its efforts to consolidate trade and business ties with its Iran, insisting
the two neighboring countries were “determined to weather the crisis”.

He said Iraq’s refusal to adhere to US sanctions on Iran was meant to
compensate Iran’s support for Iraq which persisted until two years ago when
the Arab country purged Daesh militants from its territories.

> “As Iran was beside Iraq at the time of Daesh insurgency, now Iraq will
stand by its friendly and neighboring country during sanctions,” said the
Iraqi ambassador.

In his speech, Qandil expressed hope that the value of trade between Iraq and
Iran could increase from the current level of $12 billion and reach a target
of $20 billion a year.

He said that Iraqi embassy in Tehran was ready to issue free-of-charge visas,
which has been in place for Iranian pilgrims since last year, for businessman,
saying the process would be carried out  in the shortest time possible.

The envoy also called for setting up industrial zones in regions near the
border between Iran and Iraq, saying the move would lead to economic
developments in those areas.

The striker, who won the last of his 89 Japan caps some 19 years ago, will now play in the Japanese second division until at least the age of 52 - an age he reaches next month.

""I will not waste it for one minute, one second,"" he said.

""I think that I want to go face to face with football and go to daily training with maximum power.""

Miura was born in the same month as Italy legend Roberto Baggio, who retired in 2004, and broke Stanley Matthews' record as the oldest professional to score a goal in 2017.

He failed to score in nine appearances in the 2018 season, which saw Yokohama lose in the play-offs.

766902,theindependent,"The advent of smartphones quickly led to personal devices becoming indispensable parts of the fitness tool box. In fact, entire industries quickly popped up with a focus on incorporating smartphones into workouts with as little hassle, inconvenience, and discomfort as possible. The result was the introduction of the modern fitness armband in the early 2000s.

From the first models, which were made of clunky plastic and thick nylon and elastic that soaked up and held moisture, to today’s lightweight, wicking products that are barely noticeable when worn, fitness armbands have come a long way. We tested products with a focus on strength, functionality, durability, comfort, and price. We picked bands that fit most smartphones and most budgets, so there’s a product for everyone on our list, from the weekend warriors training for a 5K run to athletes who compete at the highest levels.

The Armtrek Pro made this list—and became our Indy Best pick—the hard way. It consistently performed as advertised, enabling us to use the touch screen even under poor conditions, like running in the rain, and showed a heavy-duty durability that far outweighed its lightweight price. It was also remarkably comfortable, even during intense exercise, and stayed snugly in place throughout. The built-in key compartment was a nice feature that we found convenient and helped make this such an appealing piece of equipment.

The Armtrek fits iPhone 6, 6s, 7 Plus, 8, 8x; Samsung Galaxy S9, S9+, S8 Plus; S7 Edge; Note 5, 8 or 9; and even some of their protective cases. But be warned: the one drawback we found with the Armtrek was the inability to use the fingerprint button while your phone is in the case.

This armband is among the most versatile we reviewed. It comes with two strap sizes, so the band fits snugly on bare arms or over clothes, and is made of tough neoprene and nylon that we found durable and rugged. What makes this band stand out though is the comfort. We found it easy to forget we were wearing it, even during strenuous exercise. It also has huge storage space, with extra pockets to hold cash, credit cards, and small personal items.

The V8 fits all protective & battery pack cases of phones up to 165 x 90 x 16 mm.

This classic armband provides standard protection for your smartphone while combining the durability and comfort Nike is famous for. We found this band easy to wear, lightweight, and wicked moisture well. The small pocket was convenient, and could fit more than just a key and a few credit cards. The band material is standard neoprene and wicks moisture well. This band is a bit expensive, but you’re paying for the Nike name, and all the durability and style that comes with it.

This band delivers more than we expected based on price, but inexpensive equipment like this has its limitations. It advertises “full touch screen functionality” while the phone is in the case, but we found that to be true only some of the time—sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn’t. The “no slip design” was, however, as advertised, and we found that the TRIBE band stayed snugly in place, even in heat and damp conditions.

The TRIBE band is water resistant, but remember that it’s not water proof. In heavy rain conditions, your phone will get wet in the case. The TRIBE band fits iPhone X, Xs, 8, 7, 6, and 6S; and Samsung Galaxy S9, S8, S7, S6, and A8.

The Run Tie is sleek, light, and flexible. But what this product gives you in portability it takes away in protection for your device. The Run Tie is basically an armband with a board that has four strong, heavy duty elastic bands attached which hold your phone in place when wrapped around the four corners. The bands hold on the phone is surprisingly solid, and we had no problem with our iPhone staying in place. But the phone is completely exposed with no protection and other than the durability of the bands, there really aren’t any other special features. The Run Tie is great if protecting your device isn’t a priority and you’re seeking a minimal profile for your armband.

This band is more like a pocket worn on the arm. It’s advertised as sweat-proof, but the neoprene does a below-average job of keeping the arm dry during use. Functionally, it’s good for prolonged activity like distance running, because your phone is secured inside a pocket, inaccessible. It has decent storage, stayed relatively tight during an extended workout, and the earphone hole is a nice, convenient feature.

But it’s not very durable, and we noticed some wear and tear after just a few uses. If you’re looking for an armband to strap on and forget about for a few hours, this is it. But if you need to interact with your device during activity, look for another model.

This band fits iPhone 5, 6 and 7 models, Samsung 8, S7, S6, S5, S4, S3, S2 and HTC, as well as any phone with a screen up to 5.8""

Armpocket’s i-35 is filled with little features that make it worth the high cost. The built-in, multi-mode LED lights are helpful in a pinch, especially during early-morning runs, and the memory foam, no-slip fit is comfortable and reassuring. There are storage compartments for cash, credit cards, keys and other personal items, including interior storage pockets for high-value items and the wicking material helps keep arms dry even during intense workouts.

The i-35 product will fit most smartphone models.

Tune Belt’s sweat resistant design really delivers: This was the most moisture-minimizing armband that we tested. Featuring moisture wicking fabric, the design of this band provides protection from sweat but also from the elements. It’s comfortable and stays put, a huge plus during strenuous exercise. It’s washable, and the touchscreen is easy to use when the phone is in the case.  The Tune Belt is compatible with iPhone 6, 6S, 7, 8, X, XS, and Galaxy S9, S8, S7, S6.

If you’re looking for an armband on a budget, this band is about as low-cost as you can get without completely sacrificing quality. The Jemache band has a few features—earphone cable storage, a pocket to hold one key, and the material of the band wicks sweat from the arm fairly effectively. But it’s the ability to use the touchscreen reliably and the option to use the fingerprint scanner that makes this band worth using. It does lack durability, though, and we noticed significant wear after only a few uses.

This band is compatible with all iPhone 6, 6S Plus, 7, 7 Plus, and 8, 8 Plus.

This armband’s touch-sensitive screen cover delivers—it was the most sensitive cover we tested. Using our iPhone through the cover was simple, so much so that we barely noticed it. The sweat-proof protection was good, and our phone stayed dry throughout an hour-long workout. Active Armband also adjusts to fit a broad range of arm sizes and stayed in place with little adjustment needed. The Active band fits all iPhone 7 and 8 models.

We loved Sporteer’s Velocity V8, and discovering its durability after we already discovered its other attributes, including huge storage capacity and a comfortable fit, was a bonus. It is a bit pricy for a fitness accessory but we feel it’s worth the cost. However, if you’re looking for something for more of a budget we recommend Tribe’s water-resistant band or Trianium’s Armtrek. Both are durable and have some nice features and both are priced under 10 dollars.

292205,liveaction,"Despite an agreement saying that its beliefs and values would be respected, a Catholic hospital in Canada is being forced to participate in assisted suicide after facing legal battles from assisted suicide advocacy organizations.

St. Martha’s Regional Hospital Complex in Antigonish, Nova Scotia, gave control of the hospital to the Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) in 1996 after previously being run by the Sisters of St. Martha — but signed an agreement saying the hospital’s Catholic identity would be protected. This meant assisted suicide was not allowed at St. Martha’s. But outrage from assisted suicide advocacy group Dying with Dignity resulted in threats of a potential legal challenge under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This led the NSHA to quietly announce that “[a]ssessments and provision of MAiD [medical assistance in dying] will be available in a section of St. Martha’s Regional Hospital complex at the Antigonish Health and Wellness Centre” in a statement.

Unsurprisingly, Dying with Dignity celebrated the change. “We hope that this is the start and that Nova Scotia’s regulation, Nova Scotia’s position will be used as a model in other jurisdictions across the country. We’re certainly pushing for that,” Jim Cowan, chair of Dying with Dignity, told Global News.

However, a statement from the Sisters of St. Martha insisted that assisted suicide would not be committed within the hospital, but solely in the Antigonish Health and Wellness Centre building, which is attached to the hospital.

As noted by Bioedge, worldwide pressure is mounting on Catholic health care providers to drop their opposition to things like abortion and assisted suicide. One example is Jocelyn Downie, of Dalhousie University, who specifically singled out St. Martha’s to reporters. “[I]t’s indefensible to have a publicly funded institution have a faith-based filter on the services that are available,” she said, attacking the idea of organizations like St. Martha’s receiving taxpayer funding while refusing to participate in abortion and assisted suicide.

Moves like these send a chilling message, not just for pro-life issues, but for religious freedom and conscience rights as well. Ultimately, what pro-death activists are saying is that any organization unwilling to participate in active killing should not be allowed to receive taxpayer funding, at a time when conscience protections are already under attack around the world.

WADA also informed the Russian side that it had a three-week time to provide explanations on the issue.

MOSCOW, September 23. /TASS/. The situation around the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) should not be politicized, Valery Gazzaev, a Russian lawmaker, football manager and former football player, said on Monday.

""I don’t think this working process should be politicized, as, say, the Western media, which are in the habit of publishing anti-Russian articles, are now doing. They have always vigorously attacked Russia — suffice it to recall the situation around the FIFA World Cup which was ultimately held in Russia at the highest possible level, despite their criticism. So, I would repeat, it is a working process and only those who are obsessed with this idea see politics behind it,"" Gazzaev, who is deputy chairman of the committee for physical culture, sports, tourism and youth affairs of the Russian State Duma lower parliament house, told TASS.

""RUSADA’s status has been reinstated. It provided the original database of doping samples of Russian athletes from the Moscow laboratory to WADA. The condition of the database integrity verification was known from the beginning. If WADA has any questions, the Russian side has time to answer them,"" he noted.

""I hope all the disputable matters will be settled in due time, and a fair decision on RUSADA will follow,"" he added.

Specialists from WADA were granted access to the database of the Moscow Anti-Doping Laboratory in January this year and copied 24 terabytes of information on Russian athletes’ doping samples collected between 2012 and 2015. WADA experts finished their work to retrieve doping samples from the Moscow Lab on April 30 having collected 2,262 doping samples in 4,524 containers (Samples A and B).

The WADA Executive Committee reinstated the compliance status of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) on September 20, 2018 on condition that WADA experts would be granted access before December 31, 2018 to doping samples at the Moscow Anti-Doping Lab, which was sealed off in connection with a federal investigation.","Situation around RUSADA should not be politicized, says Russian MP",sport,sport organisation,376
106565,cnn,"(CNN) President Donald Trump said Saturday that Taliban leaders were to travel to the US for secret peace talks this weekend but that the meeting has been canceled and he's called off peace talks with the militant group entirely.

Trump tweeted that he scrapped the meeting after the Taliban took credit for an attack in Kabul, Afghanistan, that killed a dozen people, including an American soldier

Inviting Taliban leaders onto American soil is an unprecedented move and a significant development in America's longest running war just days from the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. It comes after Trump said as recently as late last month that he is planning to withdraw thousands of US forces from Afghanistan but will keep 8,600 troops in the country at least for the time being. It's not clear if Trump's Saturday night announcement will impact that plan.

""Unbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday,"" Trump tweeted Saturday night.

Trump claimed that before traveling to the US on Saturday evening, ""Unfortunately, in order to build false leverage, they admitted to......an attack in Kabul that killed one of our great great soldiers, and 11 other people.""

""I immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations,"" Trump added.

CNN military analyst John Kirby, a retired Navy rear admiral and former State Department and Pentagon spokesman, called the news ""stunning,"" saying this would give the Taliban ""a boost of political legitimacy that they don't deserve at this stage in negotiations and would be a huge propaganda victory for them, not to mention a slap at the Afghan government and President Ghani.""

The President slammed the leaders for thinking that the attacks would improve their negotiating position.

The State Department referred CNN to the White House for comment. The US National Security Council did not respond to request for comment.

The Afghanistan government blamed the Taliban for the canceled peace talks, saying the group's ""obstinacy to increase violence against Afghans"" is the ""main obstacle"" to peace negotiations.

""We have consistently stressed that genuine peace is possible when the Taliban stop the killing of Afghans, embrace an inclusive ceasefire, and enter into direct negotiations with the Afghan government,"" the government said in a statement.

The insurgent group has not halted its campaign of violence as the peace talks with the US have taken place but Thursday's killing of an American when a deal was reportedly close appears to have prompted the dramatic move from the President.

The Afghan government did not push for the cancellation of the meeting at Camp David after the Taliban attack this week, it was a decision by the White House and the State Department, according to a source familiar with the planning.

Despite Trump saying in his tweet Saturday that peace negotiations are called off, new dates are being discussed by the White House for a potential meeting with the Taliban and the Afghan government, the source says. It's unclear if the Taliban will have to make hard and fast commitments before the meeting or if Trump is using the cancellation and rescheduling simply as a negotiating tactic.

The US troop withdrawals could mark the beginning of the conflict triggered by 9/11 that has cost billions in taxpayer dollars and claimed more than 2,300 American lives.

In his tweets, Trump cast doubt on the leaders' bargaining abilities in light of the killings.

Earlier this week CNN was told by a source informed on the matter that the State Department and the National Security Council were working on scheduling a US-Afghan government meeting as well as a US-Taliban meeting on US soil, though the location was never explicitly stated. Afghanistan wanted it sooner rather than later, but the US side was looking at the middle of this month as the most likely date.

Trump was involved in the planning personally, hoping that it would come to fruition in the coming week, the source said. He got personally attached to the outcome and the logistics of the talks after meeting with top advisers about the Afghan peace process in August.

Before that, US Special Envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad had been given a long leash to do the negotiating to bring all parties -- including the Taliban -- to an agreement.

A source familiar with details of the meeting told CNN the plan had been for Trump to meet separately with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and with the Taliban's chief negotiator, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. If Trump's meetings had gone well, the hope was to convince the two Afghans to meet face to face.

The stakes were high, according to the source, because it would have been politically toxic for Mullah Baradar to meet with Ghani. The Taliban negotiator is not authorized to talk to the Afghan government.

The Afghan government had for months been frustrated that they had not been invited to Washington by Trump during his first two and a half years in office. Afghan officials had planned to come last year right after UN General Assembly meeting but the trip fell apart because the timing did not work out, and the Trump administration canceled the visit.

Trump's announcement Saturday comes as the US and the Taliban appeared to be close to finalizing a peace deal. Khalilzad returned to Doha, Qatar, this week to resume talks with the Taliban.

Khalilzad had told Afghanistan's TOLOnews on Monday that the US and the Taliban have reached an agreement ""in principle,"" pending final approval by Trump.

Khalilzad said that based on the draft agreement, the US would pull troops from five bases across Afghanistan within 135 days so long as the Taliban met conditions set out in the agreement. The US currently has about 14,000 service members in Afghanistan, alongside NATO troops, helping to train and advise Afghan troops and conducting counterterrorism operations.

425900,pravadareport,"Brenton Tarrant, the shooter from New Zealand's Christchurch, was not a lone wolf. The West has missed out an important point - the formation of organised Christian extremism. Tarrant killed  about 50 people in two mosques. At first glance, this crime is reminiscent to the that committed by Anders Breivik, who killed 77 in Norway in 2011. Breivik was a ""lonely wolf"", though. Is Tarrant another lone terrorist, or is he a member of an extremist group?

In his 74-page manifesto titled ""The Great Replacement,"" Tarrant said that he comes from a working, low-income family. He moved to New Zealand from Australia to plan an attack that would reveal the truth about the ""attack on our civilization,"" ""that nowhere in the world is safe."" ""We must crush immigration and deport those invaders already living on our soil,"" he wrote. ""It is not just a matter of our prosperity, but the very survival of our people.""

By ""invaders"" Tarrant means Muslims. The killer described his attack as an act of ""revenge on the invaders for the hundreds of thousands of deaths caused by foreign invaders in Europeans lands throughout history.

Here is an excerpt from the manifesto:

""To take revenge on the invaders for the hundreds of thousands of deaths caused by foreign invaders in European lands throughout history.

""To take revenge for the enslavement of millions of Europeans taken from their lands by the Islamic slavers.

""To take revenge for the thousands of European lives lost to terror attacks throughout European lands.

""To directly reduce immigration rates to European lands by intimidating and physically removing the invaders themselves.

""To incite violence, retaliation and further divide between the European people and the invaders currently occupying European soil.

""To avenge those European men and women lost in the constant and never ending wars of European history who died for their lands, died for their people only to have their lands given away to any foreign scum that bother to show up.""

New Zealand is a country where it is not easy to buy automatic or semi-automatic weapons, which Tarrant used in his attack. One requires a license, which a person can receive after a number of thorough police inspections. It does not seem to be likely that the killer could obtain the license himself. It seems much more likely that the weapons were provided to him from local members of a criminal group.

It just so happens that the West has missed the moment of the formation of the organised protest extremist movement of white people with Bibles in their hands. It goes without saying that they have nothing to do with Christians and Christianity, just like those who kill in the name of the Quran. Such terrible crimes come as a radical act of protest against the policy of the global melting pot, multiculturalism and omnipresent tolerance.

Security Specialist Paul Buchanan told Herald.nz that Tarrant was a member of ultra-right communities on social networks. Another member of those groups shot parishioners at a synagogue in Pittsburgh last year. Buchanan believes that Christchurch is home to a very active community of white supremacists who have repeatedly attacked refugees and people of color in the last 20 years.

""New Zealand had succumbed to ""the homicidal politics of confrontation that we see in the US and Europe,"" Buchanan said.

Dmitry Mosyakov, chief of the Center for Southeast Asia at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, told Pravda.Ru that  in Europe, tensions between migrants, most often from Muslim countries, and the local population are most often eased at courts. ""In most cases, people would make some posters and hold a demonstration to say that they condemn violence. However, Australia and New Zealand is a patriarchal society, in which non-acceptance of migrants may lead to a terrible tragedy. When migrants tried to harass Australian women on the beach, all of Sydney was infuriated very quickly,"" Dmitry Mosyakov said.

In other words, the ""Western periphery"" has never become part of liberal policy of multiculturalism and tolerance. ""Many believe that New Zealand is like heaven on Earth. It is really so, if you come to the country as a tourist. However, if you live there as a local resident, then you live in the environment that is exempt from global Western trends,"" the expert noted.

According to him, the Christchurch massacre will cause great and just riots in the Muslim world, because it is an absolutely unprovoked terrorist act: there is no Muslim extremism in New Zealand.""

""At the same time, there were examples of such extremism in South-East Asia, for example, when Australians were killed in Bali explosions. This indicates deep contradictions inside the modern Western world. The liberal paradigm is not successful in regulating interethnic and inter-religious relations,"" concluded Dmitry Mosyakov.

We would like to add here that New Zealand, just like Australia and many other countries of the world, used to be a British colony. Anglo-Saxons had colonised those countries and did their best to exterminate indigenous populations. They colonise half of the world, use humans as slaves and then complain of immigrants and call them invaders.",Christchurch aftermath: Invaders complain of invaders,religion and belief,religious conflict,839

153172,drudgereport,"Oct 31 (Reuters) - An estimated 9,120 barrels of oil have spilled from TC Energy Corp's Keystone crude pipeline in North Dakota, state authorities said on Thursday, a major leak at a time of increased regulatory scrutiny of oil pipeline expansions.

The initial estimate makes it one of the biggest onshore crude spills in the past decade and the largest for Keystone, according to U.S. Pipeline Hazardous Materials and Safety Administration (PHMSA) data back to 2010.

The cause of the rupture has not been disclosed.

Pipeline operator TC Energy is seeking to expand its pipelines linking Western Canadian oil fields to U.S. refineries with its proposed Keystone XL project. The $6 billion project has faced regulatory and environmental hurdles despite backing by U.S. President Donald Trump.

A nearly 10-year legal fight between TC Energy, formerly called TransCanada, and environmental activists has delayed development of the line that would run from Alberta, Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast. A Nebraska court in August affirmed an alternative route through the state, raising hopes the project might proceed and provide badly needed transport for Alberta's crude.

Western Canada Select heavy oil traded on Thursday at $20 per barrel less than U.S. benchmark WTI, the biggest discount in 11 months, according to Net Energy Exchange.

On Wednesday, TC Energy said its 590,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Keystone pipeline system to the United States was shut after a drop in pressure was detected. It said there were no injuries and it was investigating the cause of the breach near Edinburg, North Dakota.

The company has not said when pipeline operations would restart, but told shippers that service to U.S. Midwest refiners would remain shut during the outage. The line could remain shut for at least a week, according to market sources on Thursday.

TC Energy has begun using backhoes and vacuum trucks to recover the spilled oil, said Brent Nelson, an emergency response manager for Walsh County who visited the site.

""At this time I would estimate 50 – 75 persons on site working between two shifts ... they are focusing on oil recovery at this time and will then move to making repairs,"" he said.

The exact amount of oil released will not be available until recovery has been completed, TC Energy said in a statement on Thursday.

In 2017, a Keystone crude pipeline leak in rural South Dakota spilled nearly 6,600 barrels, the PHMSA data showed. Earlier this year, Keystone was partially shut after leaking 43 barrels of crude in Missouri.

The latest release also affected a wetland area, a statement from the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality said.

""They've had a few spills ... more than you would hope to have on a line that's still fairly new,"" said Carl Weimer, executive director of the Pipeline Safety Trust in Bellingham, Washington, a nonprofit promoting pipeline safety.

Keystone has leaked substantially more oil, and more often, in the United States than the company indicated to regulators in risk assessments before operations began in 2010, according to a Reuters review in 2017.

The Keystone outage also disrupted flows on the Marketlink pipeline out of the Cushing, Oklahoma, storage hub, roiling oil prices at the delivery point for U.S. crude futures.

199761,fortruss,"In an interview with DW Brasil, former Brazilian ambassador to Beijing, Marcos Caramuru, revealed the great interest Chinese companies have in potential infrastructure work in Brazil. Even with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro showing initial hostility towards China during his 2018 election campaign, his opinion appears to have changed given the huge sums involved in bilateral relations and the opportunities the Asian country can provide the economic struggling Latin American Giant.

Bolsonaro is commonly known as the ‘Tropical Trump’ for his open admiration of the U.S. President and his shared ideas and beliefs. Therefore, it was unsurprising that he said “The Chinese are not buying in Brazil… They are buying Brazil,” in the pre-election campaign.

Global Times speculated that “it’s inconceivable the new Bolsonaro government would give up on the Chinese market.” It also left a note of caution for the Brazilian leader who made another major antagonism towards China: “His trip to Taiwan during the presidential campaign caught the ire of Beijing. If he continues to disregard the basic principle over Taiwan after taking office, it will apparently cost Brazil a great deal … The Chinese island won’t bring any more benefits to Brazil, which Bolsonaro and his team must be aware of.”

Marcus Vinicius Freitas, a visiting professor at the China Foreign University in Beijing, explained that: “When the Chinese look at Brazil they actually see an amusement park where everything still needs to be done.” His assessment is in reference to the huge developmental and infrastructural opportunities that Brazil has, with many sectors remaining underdeveloped despite the domineering position Brazil has over the wider Latin American region. “There is no doubt that China has a menu of options for Brazil,” he added, citing Chinese technologies in road, subway, rail, viaduct and airport construction that could be of interest to Brazil.

There are also additional opportunities from agribusiness to commodities, the most attractive sector for Chinese capital is infrastructure and major works, especially in the area of ​​gas, oil, renewable energy which will ensure growth on a sustainable and significant basis for the Brazilian economy.

However, despite the significant economic relationship between the two countries and the opportunities China can provide Brazil, it had not stopped Bolsonaro from aggravating Beijing. Therefore, it would be assumed that Bolsonaro would submit to Trump’s every demand in the midst of the U.S. president’s trade war with China. However, this has proven not to be the case with Brazil’s Vice President Hamilton Mourão saying in June that his country does not plan to ban Huawei from providing 5G equipment to telecoms in his country, signalling that Bolsonaro has said one thing during the election campaign, but acted in another way while president.

This would suggest that Bolsonaro’s government is following a different path than initially anticipated and the Brazilian president is not a complete U.S. puppet as often said by his critics. Although Trump told Bolsonaro during the latter’s visit to the White House earlier this year that Huawei was a security threat, the Brazilian Vice President emphasized that Brazil has no reason to distrust Huawei and that his country needs the Chinese technology to help its continued development.

As Beijing has been calling for a resolution to the Trump-initiated trade war, China’s ambassador to Brazil, Yang Wanming, accused the United States of bullying and lobbying its trading partners, affecting the entire global economy. He explains that the U.S. ruined market confidence, increased the risk of global recession and endangered emerging economies like Brazil.

And in this scenario, it would be important for Brasilia and Beijing to defend international cooperation and multilateralism. China’s GDP grew by ‘only’ 6.2% in the second quarter of 2019, which is the lowest economic growth recorded since 1992. This so-called economic ‘slowdown’ has served as a successful bait to trigger Western media.

As a result, Trump declared that his tariff war with China was working and said his protectionist measures had led to the exodus of companies from the Asian giant. However, if the measures were so successful Trump would not continue to threaten his partners from trading with China. The Bolsonaro government has seen that in this situation, siding with the U.S. is not in its interests.

Although Bolsonaro will continue to take on a very pro-Trump stance in Latin American affairs, especially against Cuba and Venezuela, he has demonstrated that he is unwilling to embroil Brazil in international issues besides those relating to Israel, serving the interests of the powerful Christian Evangelical lobby in the South American country.

In fact, an argument can be made that Brazil benefits from the ongoing trade war between the two Great Powers. China has continually been placing large orders of Brazilian soybeans, choosing the South American country to fill the supply gap after stopping U.S. purchases. Chinese buyers are increasingly looking for Brazilian soybeans.

China halted U.S. soybean imports as tensions between Beijing and Washington increased and turned to Brazil. For now, Brazil has been able to respond to China’s demand, but its supply is running low and Beijing is at risk of failing to meet its needs. With any end to the trade war, it is unlikely that China will revert and make the U.S. its most important soy purchaser, providing an opportunity for Brazil to consolidate its own position.

Whether it was through a sudden realization, or whether it was from internal pressures from Brazil’s powerful agricultural industry and other important advisers, Bolsonaro has certainly done a 180 towards his China rhetoric. With the status of Brazil’s role in BRICS questioned by experts last year because of Bolsonaro’s initial hostility towards China and his vivid support for Trump, his Foreign Minister Ernesto Araújo has fully embraced his country’s chairmanship of the organization. This demonstrates that no matter the motivating reason, Bolsonaro has certainly changed his China policy from hostility to openness and welcomeness as the Asian country can drastically improve Brazil’s economic situation.",From Hostility to Warmness: Why has Brazilian President Changed his Aggressive Anti-China Actions?,politics,political process,972
663748,thedenverpost,"HIGHLANDS RANCH — Nesting on rocks within metro Denver’s widest expanse of suburban settlement, a pair of golden eagles recently produced two eaglets.

The eaglets just fledged, and this week were venturing away from their home made of sticks — honing skills in flying and picking off rabbits, snakes and prairie dogs.

Far more sensitive to disturbances than their bald eagle cousins, federal biologists say, golden eagles are facing habitat degradation along Colorado’s booming Front Range and increasingly are being forced out. Accelerating development surrounds these eagles’ Wildcat Mountain perch on a 150-foot cliff, a tenth of a mile from a busy road and a half mile from pastel-hued housing.

But the eagles have nested successfully for years because Douglas County officials and the developers who in the 1980s built Highlands Ranch — which now has a population of 105,000 — deliberately concentrated housing on relatively small lots. (The overall Highlands Ranch population density exceeded Denver’s before 2017.)

This configuration allowed preservation of 8,200 acres of natural habitat dubbed “backcountry wilderness,” where the eagles hunt. It adds to the 2,850 acres of green space near homes.

“People can go out on a trail, or go mountain biking, close to their homes. It makes Highlands Ranch unique. That uniqueness is going to increase as development continues to take over the Front Range,” said Mark Giebel, backcountry director for the Highlands Ranch Community Association.

The original developers wanted balance, committed to it in a 1988 open space agreement, and then completed construction.

In comparison, while Denver’s leaders traditionally platted out natural space in an effort to be “a city within a park,” they’ve failed in recent years to keep pace with population growth and now may give up some remaining open parcels for development. Mayor Michael Hancock has championed “pocket parks,” a quarter acre or smaller and partly paved to endure heavy use. A stormwater runoff burden caused by increasing “impervious” surfaces looms with costs in the billions.

Highlands Ranch residents, in contrast, can connect with nature near where they live with 46 percent of their overall 37.5 square-mile area preserved as green space. That’s five times the percentage of parkland within Denver’s 155 square miles.

“I would never not have green space — because of all the people living here,” said Libby Price, 73, a retired schoolteacher who works as a voluntary guide and protector of the golden eagles.

“It gives me such peace,” Price said. “It always gives me peace if I am sad or depressed. You just feel so much better.”

The clumped-together housing with bigger green space has led to coexistence with wildlife, including elk herds. Coyotes are common close to homes. Several bears and a few mountain lions are observed each year using 20 remote-controlled cameras.

The golden eagles survive largely because “they have a 13-square-mile healthy ecosystem where they can hunt,” Giebel said.

“If you would have had houses spread out across the 24,000 acres and had one-acre lots, you would not have this diversity of wildlife. You would not have these true conservation areas where wildlife can live unmolested by humans,” he said. “We have this huge open space. Wildlife is the priority. And there’s not the public access that leads to people loving it to death.”

A network of trails covering 26 miles — half open to the public and half for residents who pay an annual homeowner-association fee — enables strolling and cycling. Dogs aren’t allowed on the resident-only trails, and on the open county trails the rules require leashes.

“Dogs have an impact on wildlife, even when on a leash,” Giebel said, citing studies from the University of Colorado and Colorado State University.

There are challenges in this emerging coexistence.

Volunteers have spotted teenagers atop the cliff where the eagles nest. Trails to that area are closed between April and September. And volunteers say they face pushback when enforcing the dog prohibition.

Douglas County sheriff’s deputies can be called for backup. For the most part, diplomatic encouragement of compliance has worked out, Highlands Ranch officials said.

Conflicts arise as coyotes find they can thrive better by feeding on garbage near homes, drawing them into contact with domestic pets. And occasionally residents glimpse bears and mountain lions.

“We say, ‘This is the type of place animals are supposed to be,’ ” Giebel said. “When we get reports of animals, we do not say it is an emergency. We say, ‘It is very fortunate you were able to see those animals. You are visiting their home. We expect that residents from time to time will see animals.’ ”

As elsewhere around Colorado, residents increasingly demand recreation opportunities and seemingly prioritize recreation over preservation of natural processes.

“There’s always pressure to add more recreation,” Giebel said. “Trails would be an example. We may add more trails in the future, but we’ll always want to protect the areas where there is no public access. When you add trails, it changes the behavior of animals and how they use an area.”

Highlands Ranch residents said they’re glad to live in a place they’re not compelled to escape.

“Tax me for this. I will pay,” said Jennifer Letheby, 47, walking her leashed golden retriever mix on a county trail this week near the golden eagles.

Price, the volunteer, had just spotted an eaglet. “Great to know they’ve survived, but it’s not over yet.”

Relatives visiting from outside Colorado typically marvel at the options for hiking without having to drive up Interstate 70, said Annie Morse, 49, as she strolled this week.

Walking on unpaved trails feels better than walking in partially paved parks — “like you are hiking in nature,” she said.

And as housing, commercial, highway and other construction ramp up across south metro Denver, she and others in Highlands Ranch said they favored growth limits.

“It is depressing to me to see this growth sprawling,” Morse said. “At some point, you have to preserve a little of what drew people here.”","Golden eagles survive amid suburbia of Highlands Ranch, thanks to preservation of natural habitat",environment,conservation,965
77430,breitbart,"The White House on Friday said it expects the new phase one trade deal with China would be finished in the first week of January 2020, in a briefing with reporters detailing the deal.

White House senior advisor Larry Kudlow said the deal would be signed by Ambassador Robert Lighthizer and the Chinese vice premiere in a few weeks at the administerial level, after all of the documents were completed. A senior administration official told reporters that the they expected that date to be in the first week of 2020.

Kudlow praised the deal as a “very important first step” representing real progress with China that covered “all of the key chapters.”

He ticked off a list of achievements including tariff adjustments, Chinese commitments to purchase American goods, financial service reform, currency reform, intellectual property rights, and reform of the Chinese forced transfer of technology.

A senior administration official told reporters that China agreed to increase its American goods and services purchases by at least $200 billion in the next two years, with an average of $40-$50 billion in agricultural products.

“We are very comfortable that our farmers and ranchers and growers can meet those numbers,” the official said.

The official confirmed that the deal would include a strong enforcement mechanism that would ensure that the commitments from China would take place. He said:

If we decide that China has violated a provision of the agreement, we can take responsive action and/or suspend concessions under the agreement. It could take the form of tariffs but we have the ability to take that action if they’re not abiding by their commitments.

Trump agreed not to level additional tariffs scheduled for December 15 and even cut tariffs leveled in September in half. The original 25 percent tariff remains in place as the president pursues phase two of the trade deal with China.

“There are other issues that we need to address moving forward and we’re very much committed to doing that,” the official said, assuring that the 25 percent tariff would remain.",White House Expects Phase One China Trade Deal to Be Signed in January,politics,international relations,331
56122,birminghammail,"Three men have been jailed for a total of 30 years for causing a woman's death in a hit-and-run crash after a high-speed chase.

Innocent victim Elizabeth Roberts, an 80-year-old grandmother, was fatally injured when a BMW careered the wrong way down a road and smashed into a Ford Fiesta in which she was a passenger.

It happened after the BMW was chased for eight miles by a Volkswagen Jetta following an incident involving another Fiesta.

The BMW and the VW collided in Gaydon, Warwickshire , before the BMW went the wrong way along the B4451, causing the crash in which Mrs Roberts died.

After a two-week trial, defendants Naqash Hussain, 29, of Prescott Avenue, Banbury, and Sagar Taseem, 26, of Evenlode, Banbury, were found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving.

They were jailed for 12 years each at Warwick Crown Court.

A third man, Samuel Franklin, 24, of Warkworth Close, Banbury, pleaded guilty to the same charge in June 2018 and was sentenced on Tuesday, February 5 to six years.

And a fourth, Kieran Flint, 21 of Barley Hill, Culworth, Northamptonshire, was cleared of dangerous driving but convicted of careless driving.

He was fined £500 and given six penalty points.

The crash happened on February 15, 2017 and the incident started in Banbury.

The court heard the BMW, containing Taseem and Hussain, had been involved in an incident with Flint's Ford Fiesta.

The BMW was then chased by the Jetta, driven by Franklin.

Both vehicles collided and shortly afterwards the BMW turned around and drove the wrong way along the B4451 into oncoming traffic, where it collided with the Fiesta Mrs Roberts was travelling in.

The Jetta then turned around and drove back to the scene of the collision, where Franklin chased the occupants of the BMW away.

The occupants of the Fiesta were taken to hospital with serious injuries but Mrs Roberts died the next morning.

Following the sentencing, Det Con Stephen Barr from Warwickshire Police said: “This was a tragic incident to investigate, which ultimately could have been avoided.

“I hope the sentencing sends out a clear message that we will not tolerate dangerous driving on our roads, and will ensure those who disregard the law will be investigated and punished for their actions.”

The family of Mrs Roberts added: “We would like to thank the emergency services and the members of the public who came to assist on the night of the collision and the medical team at University Hospital Coventry & Warwickshire.

“We would also like to thank Warwickshire Police who have worked tirelessly to bring the offenders to justice.

15975,aljazeera,"Thousands of schools have been ordered closed across Malaysia and Indonesia on Thursday, affecting at least 1.7 million students, officials said, as toxic haze from rampant forest fires in Indonesia sent air quality plummeting.

Nearly 2,500 schools were ordered to suspend classes in Malaysia - including nearly 300 in the smog-hit capital of Kuala Lumpur - over soaring health concerns sparked by toxic haze from out-of-control blazes in Indonesia's Sumatra and Borneo islands.

In the Malaysian city of Kuching, on Borneo island, the air pollution index recorded levels of 267 as of 06:00 GMT, earning a grade of ""Very Unhealthy"" and putting it among the most polluted areas in the world, according to the World Air Quality Index. Malaysia's environment ministry also categorises it as ""very unhealthy"".

In Indonesia, hundreds of schools in hard-hit Riau province on Sumatra island were also set to close on Thursday - with 800 already closed in one district alone - while about 1,300 were closed in its Central Kalimantan province on Borneo.

The closures affected at least 1.7 million students in Malaysia. It was not clear how many students were forced to stay home in neighbouring Indonesia.

Jakarta is deploying thousands of security forces and water-bombing aircraft to tackle the blazes, mostly started by illegal fires set to clear land for plantations.

The fires send smog across Southeast Asia annually, but this year has been the worst since 2015 and has added to concerns about wildfire outbreaks worldwide exacerbating global warming.

Thursday's school shutdown marked the first mass closure in Kuala Lumpur as air quality deteriorated to ""unhealthy"" or ""very unhealthy"" levels on an official index in many parts of peninsular Malaysia, to the east of Sumatra, with the capital's skyline was shrouded by dense smog.

Malaysia's Sarawak state, on Borneo, was also smothered in toxic haze, as the fires hiked diplomatic tensions.

Borneo is divided between Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei.

A growing number of Malaysians were suffering health problems due to the haze, with authorities saying there had been a sharp increase in outpatients at government hospitals.

Air quality was in the ""unhealthy"" range across Singapore on Thursday morning, according to the National Environment Agency, as the city state's environment minister called it a ""major setback"" in the fight against climate change.

""The forest fires in Indonesia and the resulting haze have affected the health and well-being of people in Indonesia and the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) region,"" Singapore's environment chief Masagos Zulkifli said on social media.

""It is regretful that so many lives and livelihoods have been impacted.

""The amount of carbon emissions generated from the fires will present a major setback to the global fight against climate change,"" he added.

The haze crisis comes as Singapore gears up to host a Formula One motor race on Sunday.

Poor visibility closed several airports in the Indonesian part of Borneo and scores of flights have already been diverted and cancelled in the region due to the smog.

Authorities have tried to induce rain through cloud seeding in a bid to extinguish the fires.

But the onset of the rainy season, which usually starts in October, could be the only thing able to douse the blazes.","Malaysia, Indonesia shut thousands of schools as haze worsens","disaster, accident and emergency incident",accident and emergency incident,516

US runners Alysia Montano, Phoebe Wright and Kara Goucher told the New York Times that Nike failed to take pregnancy and maternity into account as part of their sponsorship deals.

Montano, once in the top three female runners in the world, hit the headlines when she ran at eight months' pregnant with her first child.

In a video recorded for New York Times, she revealed she faced changes to her pay from Nike if she did not return quickly after giving birth.

She also claimed she was forced to train with a brace around her stomach to support her broken abdominal muscles.

Meanwhile, Goucher told the paper that the situation reached its worst point when her son got dangerously ill.

She said she had to choose between staying with him and training for a half marathon which she had been forced to sign up for in order to keep her sponsorship.

In a statement, Nike said it was ""common practice in our industry"" that ""agreements do include performance-based payment reductions"".

""Historically, a few female athletes had performance-based reductions applied,"" the sports company added.

""We recognised that there was an inconsistency in our approach across different sports and in 2018 we standardised our approach across all sports so that no female athlete is penalised financially for pregnancy.""

Montano, 33, turned Nike's Dream Crazier tagline against them, claiming maternity leave was ""a step too crazy"" for the firm.

**Taking over from Britain’s colonial role in exploiting the country, the US
has bullied and tried to intimidate Iran for decades.** The ongoing pretext
for strangling Iran economically is that Iran is developing nuclear weapons.
The UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency repeatedly finds [no
evidence](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/focus/iran/iaea-and-iran-iaea-
reports) for this repeated US-led lie. Then-US President Barack Obama’s Task
Force explained the real, as opposed to rhetorical, reasons for US opposition
to Iran’s development of enriched uranium for its civilian nuclear energy
programme, to which Iran is
[entitled](https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/npt/text) under Article
IV of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty–a treaty regularly
[violated](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/07488009408409180) by
the UK and US, and to which their ally Israel is not party, despite having
undeclared nuclear weapons. The Obama-era Task Force
[report](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/PTF-
Iran.pdf) reads:

> “So long as the United States firmly opposed Iran’s [civilian nuclear]
Bushehr facility, no friendly Arab state actively pursued civil nuclear power.
But once Washington accepted that Iran could have a nuclear power plant, the
United States was in no position to press its friends not to pursue a
capability it had agreed Iran could have … [I]f an agreement is reached
legitimizing even limited enrichment on Iranian soil, other countries may well
be interested in having the same capabilities, and it could be difficult
diplomatically to dissuade them from this pursuit … Demonstrating how
seriously the international community is concerned about Iran’s actions might
discourage imitators.”

**A media serving the interests of the public, not US foreign policy elites,
would make this reminder–that Iran is being abused by the US to deter regional
states from moving away from fossil-fuel dependence–regular headline news.**
Others want all-out war. Veteran reporter Seymour Hersh revealed a plan by
then-US Vice President (some say real President), Dick Cheney, to stage a fake
maritime incident between “Iranian” (disguised US vessels in reality) and US
warships. Hersh [says:](https://thinkprogress.org/exclusive-to-provoke-war-
cheney-considered-proposal-to-dress-up-navy-seals-as-iranians-and-shoot-at-
dfde0aaa2c4c/)

> “There was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war. The one that
interested me the most was why don’t we build — we in our shipyard — build
four or five boats that look like Iranian PT boats. Put Navy seals on them
with a lot of arms. And next time one of our boats goes to the Straits of
Hormuz, start a shoot-up.”

More recently, similar incidents appear to have occurred.

### _SANCTIONS: “MAKE THE PAIN MUCH GREATER”_

In 2012, Britain joined the US’s imposition of economic sanctions on Iran.
Then-UN Secretary-general Ban Ki-moon
[described](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-sanctions-un/u-n-chief-
says-sanctions-on-iran-affecting-its-people-idUSBRE89412Z20121005)
“significant effects on the general population, including an escalation in
inflation, a rise in commodities and energy costs, an increase in the rate of
unemployment and a shortage of necessary items, including medicine.” Britain’s
then-Defence Secretary, Philip Hammond,
[informed](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/07/uk-warns-iran-more-
sanctions) the Iranians: “We can definitely make the pain much greater.”
(Hammond is now working as a Member of Parliament to block Britain’s no-deal
exit from the European Union, ironically in fear of food and medicine
shortages. Fine for Iranians to suffer, but not us, thank you very much.)

The so-called “nuclear deal” praised by “liberal” Western media was, in
reality, a disaster for Iran, which the government signed with an economic
noose around its neck. In 2015, Iran and the EU (including Britain) signed the
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The United Nations Security
Council, meaning in theory the US, too, adopted the JCPOA as UNSCR 2231. Iran
agreed to limit its civilian nuclear energy programme and allow enhanced
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, which as noted fails to
find any convincing evidence of an Iranian WMD programme. The “agreement”
[states](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/122460/full-text-of-the-iran-
nuclear-deal.pdf) that “[t]he JCPOA will produce the comprehensive lifting of
all UN Security Council sanctions as well as multilateral and national
sanctions related to Iran’s nuclear programme, including steps on access in
areas of trade, technology, finance, and energy.”

But the US immediately violated the spirit of the JCPOA. The Congressional
Research Service [states](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RS20871.pdf) that
despite Obama’s lifting of “relevant sanctions,” whatever that means, the
reality is that sanctions remained in place and thus in violation of the
spirit if not letter of the JCPOA. “Remaining in place were a general ban on
U.S. trade with Iran and sanctions on Iran’s support for regional governments
and armed factions, its human rights abuses, its efforts to acquire missile
and advanced conventional weapons capabilities, and the Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps.”

In May 2018, US President Trump
[signed](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/R43311.pdf) a National Security
Presidential Memorandum, “ceasing” US “participation in the JCPOA.”

### _FISHY HAPPENINGS AT SEA_

In May of this year, Ret. Special Agent in Customs, Karl Golovin, asked the US
Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair, Gen. Dunford, about “the potential for false flag
terrorism, leading us into war with Iran.” Unusually, Gen. Dunford
[responded:](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-
content/uploads/2019/05/fp_20190529_dunford_transcript.pdf)

> “Yeah, look, I’m not going to answer the question directly. I don’t know
what others want, but I’ll just tell you this, I am very familiar with the
consequences of going to war and take the responsibility of providing military
advice in that regard very seriously … Are there people who might like to get
the United States to do something? Certainly you can see that even in the open
source where that speculation is out there. But I can guarantee you, that’s
not going to inform the military advice…”

The British House of Commons Library
[reports](http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-8597/CBP-8597.pdf)
that the US sent an aircraft carrier to the Gulf, citing alleged Iranian
escalations of proxy activities in the region. But it adds: “A deputy
commander of the Iraq-based coalition fighting ISIS/Daesh, a British Major
General, appeared to contradict that on 14 May: ‘There are a substantial
number of militia groups in Iraq and Syria, and we don’t see any increased
threat from any of them at this stage’.”

On 12 May, Iran was blamed by the US for sabotaging four oil tankers: two of
which were Saudi (an enemy of Iran), one Norwegian (neutral), and one from the
United Arab Emirates (a Western ally). Despite claims that Iran was to blame,
the United Arab Emirates’ inquiry submitted to the UN Security Council did not
mention Iran. In June, Iran was blamed by the US for attacking two tankers,
_Front Altair_  and  _Kokuka Courageous_ , providing fuzzy video to support
its case. But when asked for specific evidence, the UK’s Minister for the
Middle East,
[replied:](http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-8597/CBP-8597.pdf)
“we are as sure as we can be.”

On 4 July, thirty British Royal Marines were
[alleged](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/20/britain-lured-into-
deadly-trap-on-iran-by-trump-hawk-john-bolton) to have commandeered, in
Gibraltarian waters, the Iranian-operated tanker,  _Grace I_ , supposedly to
stop its “unlawful” delivery of oil to Syria. Iran argues, plausibly, that
this was a violation of international law because the EU sanctions against
Syria do not apply to non-EU states. Britain argues that Iran was using
Gibraltarian waters to break the law. But this misses the point: What legal or
moral right does the US or EU or Gibraltar have to dictate the nature of
Iran’s oil sales?

[](https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-
images/2019-08-03_14-37-20.jpg?itok=djj86ogK)

The Royal Marines [allegedly](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49162256) made the
civilian crew kneel on the deck whilst pointing guns at them. The captain
says: “They didn’t care whether I was master… there was no regulations (sic)…
we had 28 unarmed crew. I was in a state of shock, everybody was in a state of
shock.

**How do you come on a ship like this with armed forces and such brute force.
For what reason?” (BBC’s ellipses). The British Ministry of Defence describes
this brutality as “standard operating procedure.”**

The maritime law firm Tatham & Co. [writes:](https://tathamlaw.com/knowledge
/boarding-of-the-grace-1-exposes-british-tankers-to-action-by-iran/)

> “Perhaps what is most interesting about this seizure is that it was carried
out pursuant to the ‘Sanctions Regulations 2019’ enacted by Gibraltar on 3
July, just one day before the seizure. Those Regulations give the Chief
Minister of Gibraltar powers to designate a vessel as a ‘Specified Ship’ if he
‘has reasonable grounds to suspect that the ship … has been, or is likely to
be, involved in a breach of the EU Regulation’. The EU Regulation in question
is Regulation (EU) No. 36/2012 and a ‘Specified Ship Notice’ was issued in
Gibraltar on 3 July 2019 naming the  _Grace 1_.”

_The Observer_ ’s Simon Tisdall
[cites](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/20/britain-lured-into-
deadly-trap-on-iran-by-trump-hawk-john-bolton) “evidence” that US National
Security Advisor John Bolton’s “national security team was directly involved
in manufacturing the Gibraltar incident … when US spy satellites, tasked with
helping block Iranian oil exports in line with Trump’s global embargo, began
to track Grace I on its way, allegedly, to Syria, Bolton saw an opportunity.”
In addition to remember Dick Cheney’s scheme from more than a decade ago, it
should also be remembered that Bolton wrote a book about Iran and US-led
geopolitics in general, entitled  _Surrender Is Not An Option_. Spain does not
formally recognize Britain’s territorial claims over Gibraltar. Why didn’t the
Spanish intervene in this allegedly unlawful Iranian move? Because the US,
presumably as part of the “trap,” already tipped off British intelligence
(read: instructed them to seize the vessel).

**In revenge, the Iranians seized two ships: the British-registered, Swedish-
owned _Stena Impero_  and the British-operated  _Mesdar_.**

### _IN CONCLUSION_

**Britain has pirated and plundered Iran for well-over a century, most notably
by stealing its oil via the virtual monopoly, Anglo-Persian (now BP).** The US
worked with Britain in 1953 to overthrow the Mossadeq government. They imposed
the blood-thirsty Shah on the people of Iran and never forgave the Iranians
for shaking off their shackles in the Islamic Revolution 1979. In addition to
arming Iran’s enemy-next-door, Saddam Hussein, during the brutal war
(1980-89), the US, Britain and Israel have engaged in subversion activities,
including murder and sabotage. **The recent seizure of the Iranian tanker is a
continuation of imperial policy.**

What was once a paradise of tropical forests, filled with birds and wildlife, no longer existed. Can you imagine going away from your home town and on your return, you see all the trees have disappeared?

In the 1990s, Salgado’s parents gave the land to Sebastião and Lélia. Which they don’t own anymore. Today it is recognized as a nature preserve and a nonprofit organization which trains young ecologists and raises millions of tree seedling.

Salgado and his wife Lélia Deluiz Wanick Salgado, recruited partners and teams to collect funds, and in 1998, Salgado founded Instituto Terra. This institute was formed to recover 1,502 acres of rainforest in the Bulcão Farm in Aimorés, Minas Gerais. After the deforestation, the ranch was dubbed as a Private Natural Heritage Reserve. The Instituto Terra also created the Center for Environmental Education and Restoration (CERA), a place for research and education which focuses on environmental restoration

In December of 1999 Salgado planted his first seed. He clearly stated that the trees be native to the land so that the wildlife would return. Over two million seedlings of 290 species of trees were planted. The results were incredible!

Due to the replanting process, the eight natural springs that were hosted by the forest had started flowing and the fauna returned.

With close to 700 educational projects, 170 municipalities and 65,000 people who work in the Valley of the River Doce by December 2012. The River Doce covered both states of Minas Gerais & Espírito Santo, extending to the states of Rio de Janeiro & Bahia.

Salgado stated that climate change occurs due to carbon dioxide and planting trees would be the solution.

Visitors and residents fled in terror as a huge plume of smoke filled the skies above the tiny Mediterranean island last night – sending hot magma spilling down the mountain.

Emergency services rushed to the scene as the powerful explosion ignited fires on the western side of the island.

A male hiker who was hit by a falling stone was confirmed dead by authorities, while other people were injured.

The victim was a 35-year-old man from Sicily who was hiking when the volcano erupted twice.

His Brazilian friend was discovered dehydrated and in a state of shock, the AGI news agency reported.

Around 30 holidaymakers, including a number of Brits, reportedly jumped into the sea for safety as the lava sparked fires.

Several others are believed to be missing.

Alana Elliot, 31, from east London, was sunbathing when she heard the deafening boom.

She then saw a ""big mushroom cloud that looked like a nuke"" and started to panic when staff on the quiet cove in Malfa started ""running for their lives"".

The lawyer from Bethnal Green told the Sun she and her fiance “heard a really loud boom as though thunder and lightning had struck right next to us and saw people running along the beach.”

""You can see Stromboli from the bay and there was a big mushroom cloud erupting - it looked like a nuke,” she explained.

""A barman ran down and was speaking Italian to us. We thought he was saying 'Be calm it's OK' but actually he was saying 'Get out of her - but be calm'.

""We realised it was a big deal when the locals started to freak out and were running for their lives.""

Student Luca Mariani, 14, from Rome, filmed the moment the smoke cloud towered over the island-volcano.

He said: ""I had never seen something like this. I didn’t know whether to be scared or excited.”

Fiona Carter, a British tourist on the island of Panarea, some 17 miles from Stromboli, also heard the eruption.

""We turned around to see a mushroom cloud coming from Stromboli. Everyone was in shock. Then red hot lava started running down the mountain towards the little village of Ginostra,"" she said.

""The cloud got bigger, white and grey. It enveloped Ginostra and now the cloud has covered Stromboli entirely. Several boats set off for Stromboli,"" she added.

Stefano Branca, an expert with the National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology, said there had been a ""paroxysmal eruption"" on the island, when high-pressure magma explodes from a shallow, underground reservoir.

""These are events of great intensity and quite rare,"" he told Reuters.

Stromboli is known as the ""Lighthouse of the Mediterranean"" and has a population of around 500.

The last major eruption was in 2002, when a blast destroyed local buildings and piers, injuring six.

Tourists often climb to the 3,000-foot summit of the volcano and peer into its crater, with small puffs of molten rock regularly blasted into the sky. It was not clear if anyone was on the crater at the time of the blast.

According to the geology.com website, Stromboli is one of the most active volcanoes on the planet and has been erupting almost continuously since 1932.

21104,bbc,"Malaysia's Education Ministry has said it shouldn't have published an infographic in a school textbook that said girls must protect their modesty or risk being shamed and ostracised.

The textbook, aimed at nine-year-olds, was distributed to all national primary schools in Malaysia.

A picture of the graphic was shared on social media by people who said it was encouraging victim-blaming.

Critics said it showed why better sex education was needed in schools.

The graphic tells the story of a character named Amira who protects the ""modesty of her genitals"" by dressing modestly, changing clothes behind closed doors and avoiding quiet places.

It then lists what would happen should Amira not follow those three steps, saying she would face shame and emotional distress, be ostracised by friends and bring shame onto her family.

Women's Aid Organisation advocacy manager Yu Ren Chung said that the graphic sexualised nine-year-olds, and placed the burden on them to avoid sexual assault.

""The infographic ignores the fact that perpetrators are the ones responsible for sexual assault,"" he told the BBC.

Deputy education minister Teo Nie Ching told the BBC by text message that the fact that the graphic was published showed a failure in the ministry's quality control, adding that ""the general understanding on sex education is still low"".

""We lacked the sensitivity needed to avoid such a mistake,"" she said.

The textbox hasn't been recalled but the ministry has sent out a sticker to cover up the graphic.

Ms Teo said that the ministry would consider changing the way it produces textbooks, and get experts to check the material before it is sent for printing. Currently, the writers of textbooks are teachers or lecturers who are typically ""experts in the field"".

Parent Action Group for Education chairman Noor Azimah Abdul Rahim told the BBC the graphic shone a light at the bigger issue of a lack of sex education in the Malaysian syllabus.

""I've always said that the reason we haven't been able to pinpoint how we should go about [sex education] is because we can't agree on a definition. One definition, which is rather extremist, is that sex education means sexual intercourse, that's all it means.

""What I advocate, what child psychologists agree on, in its milder form is what is a good touch and a bad touch.

""Until we can agree on what needs to be taught in schools, I think there will always be this disarray with the learning instruction being offered to students,"" she told the BBC.

The Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development said last week it was looking at possibly introducing some form of sexual education into schools.",Malaysia revises 'victim-shaming' school text book,education,social learning,424
468711,rferl,"Two years after a “horrifying” antigay crackdown in Chechnya was revealed, Russian authorities have failed to provide justice for the victims, according to Amnesty International.

 

 The authorities have “shown themselves to be complicit in heinous crimes committed in Chechnya against people believed to be gay or lesbian,” Marie Struthers, the London-based human rights group director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, said in a statement on April 1.

A campaign of abuses -- including abduction, torture, and murder -- against gay men in Chechnya was first reported in April 2017 by the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, triggering a global outcry.

Human Rights Watch later said it had confirmed that police in Chechnya rounded up, tortured, and humiliated dozens of gay or bisexual men during the spring of 2017 in ""an apparent effort to purge them from Chechen society.""

However, no one has yet been held accountable for this crackdown because of “state-sponsored homophobia and impunity for human rights violations” in the North Caucasus region, Struthers said.

 

 The failure of the Russian state to provide justice for the victims unleashed another wave of “homophobic crimes” in Chechnya last year, Amnesty International said, noting that at least two people were believed to have been tortured to death in this crackdown by January 2019.

 

 Amnesty International said Russian authorities had also failed to provide effective protection to LGBT rights defender Igor Kochetkov, the leading figure in the public investigation of the crackdown in Chechnya.

 

 In January, a video containing insults and a death threat directed at Kochetkov was widely distributed across social networks.

 

 Kochetkov presented a formal complaint against the author of the video, but an official investigation has not been opened by the police to date, according to Amnesty International.

 

 However, a court in St. Petersburg last week ruled the police inaction in the case to be unlawful.

 

 Struthers urged the authorities to quickly implement the ruling and conduct a “thorough and effective investigation” into the death threats against Kochetkov and crimes in Chechnya exposed by his LGBT Network.

161806,eveningstandard,"Olivia Colman has revealed she has been locked in a battle with Wikipedia over her birthday after the website listed her as eight years older than she is.

The Oscar-nominated star took on the online encyclopedia after googling herself and finding out that it had her down as 52.

Not wanting to seem “vain”, Colman contacted the site and posed as a “friend” who just wanted to correct the honest mistake.

“Once, on Wikipedia, they had my birthday as the wrong day, the wrong month, and eight years before I was born,” the actress explained on David Tennant’s podcast.

She told her Broadchurch co-star: “I emailed them, pretending it wasn’t me. [I wrote,] ‘I was at school with her and that’s not her birthday.’ I didn’t want them to think I was being so vain.

“I didn’t get a reply, and wrote again going, ‘Sorry guys, but I know it’s wrong.’ And they didn’t reply.”

Exasperated at the lack of cooperation, Colman admitted that she was forced to come clean and tell the site that it was “really upsetting” that they had aged her almost a decade.

The 44-year-old continued: “And they said, ‘We’d have to see a birth certificate to prove it,’ and I went, ‘Whose f****** birth certificate have you looked at in the first place to make me eight years older?”

Wikipedia did eventually change Colman’s date of birth to the correct date, January 30, 1974, although the actress joked that she should have made herself younger.

Despite roles in Broadchurch, Les Miserables and soon-to-be The Crown, Colman also revealed that her career is haunted by an advert she starred in for the AA back in 2004.

The Norwich-born star admitted that she “lost some jobs” after playing the role of Bev in the iconic Kev and Bev adverts.

Colman said: “AA! That has become the bane of my life. I thought they were going to run that for about a week but they ran it for what felt like four times a day for a year.

“They ran it for a year having just given me a buy-out. It was really annoying. I lost some jobs.”

Colman was last week nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for her role as Queen Anne in The Favourite.

1011196,thetelegraph,"Mamadou Sakho is suing the world anti-doping agency for £13 million claiming a drug-test blunder torpedoed his career at Liverpool.

Sakho, 29, was suspended from football in April 2016 after testing positive for a fat-burning substance following a Europa League tie with Manchester United.

The provisional 30-day suspension meant the France international missed out on Liverpool's Europa League Final defeat to Sevilla and, he claims, cost him a team place at the Euro 2016 tournament, London's High Court heard.

He was eventually cleared in disciplinary proceedings before Uefa, with the body finding that the substance - higenamine - was not actually on the banned list.

The Crystal Palace defender is now suing for £13m, with his lawyers arguing that his earnings as a player and the worth of his personal brand have been reduced by his move away from Liverpool.

But the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) denies it is responsible for his transfer from the European Champions which it says was in reality caused by ""disciplinary issues"" and a ""personality clash"" with Jurgen Klopp.

In a hearing at the High Court, Mr Sakho's lawyers told Master Victoria McCloud that his suspension in 2016 had dealt a massive hit to his earnings.

He missed games with the France team, had to foot lawyers' and scientists' bills and, ultimately, saw the end of his career with Liverpool and transfer to Crystal Palace, said his barrister, Stuart Ritchie QC.",Mamadou Sakho sues World Anti-Doping Agency for £13m over 'drug test blunder',sport,disciplinary action in sport,226
183470,eveningstandard,"Juan Manuel Correa will spend at least another 24 hours in intensive care following surgery on injuries sustained in the Formula 2 crash which accounted for the death of Anthoine Hubert.

Hubert died on Saturday at the Belgian Grand Prix weekend when hit by Correa, who suffered multiple fractures to his legs and a minor spinal injury in the high-speed accident.

Frenchman Hubert was hit at 170mph at the Raidillon swerves and was declared dead at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit.

On Monday morning, Correa’s Sauber Junior Team released a statement over his condition in the wake of the incident.

The statement said of the Ecuadorian-American driver: “After a lengthy surgery to repair fractures to both his legs, JM Correa has started his recovery process. He will be in intensive care for at least 24 hours.

“His family is thankful to all the people who are sending caring messages. When his conditions will be more stable, JM will be transferred to the USA to follow his recovery treatment for the next few months.

""JM is overwhelmed with sadness and his prayers are with Anthoine Hubert’s family.”

The FIA has begun an investigation into Hubert’s death but insisted there was no timeframe on when it might potentially reach a conclusion.

The subsequent F2 race was cancelled while it was decided the F1 race would go ahead as planned. A minute’s silence was held ahead of Sunday's F1 grand prix after which Ferrari’s race winner Charles Leclerc dedicated the win to his friend.

Of the investigation, F1 race director Michael Masi said: “There is an investigation, and it will go from there. The FIA with our technical department, our safety department, and all of the various departments in the FIA commenced an investigation immediately.

“I don’t think we will put any time on it. Will will go through the process of conducting a full and complete investigation, as the FIA does with all serious incidents.

702872,theguardianuk,"The authors of an influential report on colonial-era artefacts, which recommended a restitution programme to transfer hundreds of items from European institutions to Africa, have criticised the British Museum for acting like “an ostrich with its head in the sand”.

The Senegalese economist Felwine Sarr and the French art historian Bénédicte Savoy, who were asked to write the report by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, after he said the return of artefacts would be a priority during his tenure, said the British Museum was not addressing the issue.

“There’s an expression in French, la politique de l’autruche, which means something is in front of you and you say you can’t see it, like an ostrich with its head in the sand,” said Sarr. “They will have to respond and they can’t hide themselves any longer on the issue.”

The 252-page report published in November 2018 made a series of recommendations, chief among them being that France should respond favourably and grant restitutions to African countries that request the return of objects taken during the colonial era.

For Sarr and Savoy, the loan of items to African museums – proposed by the British Museum and other major European institutions in the case of the Benin bronzes, which were stolen during a punitive expedition in 1897 – is not sufficient. “It’s not enough because in a loan the right of the property belongs to you,” said Sarr. “You loan something that you own, it’s your property. If you restitute there is a transfer of the property rights and the new holder of those rights can loan you the item.”

“There’s a symbolic dimension around property rights,” added Savoy. “If you can loan your objects you are respected in the museum world because you can impose your will and conditions. In the capitalist sphere being able to loan gives you power and it means you can impose your own rights.”

In response, a spokesperson for the British Museum said it welcomed a “transparent focus on the provenance of objects”, adding that the museum agreed with the report’s call for the establishment of “new and more equitable relationships between Europe and Africa”.

“We believe the strength of the collection is its breadth and depth which allows millions of visitors an understanding of the cultures of the world and how they interconnect – whether through trade, migration, conquest, or peaceful exchange,” the spokesperson added.

Since the release of the report African countries, including Ivory Coast, Senegal and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, have made formal requests for the return of artefacts, and European countries including France and Germany have committed to handing back objects. The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam has opened talks with Sri Lanka and Indonesia and described the Netherlands’ failure to return stolen artefacts as a “disgrace”.

The report, known colloquially as the Macron report, was described as radical by some in the art world upon its release, but the authors disagree. “It’s not us who are radical; it’s historical facts which are radical,” said Savoy. “There was a taboo around this fact for many centuries in Europe, the fact that many major museums have collections based on plundering. There are always ruptures when you break a taboo.”

Savoy and Sarr travelled to Mali, Senegal, Cameroon and Benin and examined the works at the Musée du quai Branly, which holds nearly 80% of the African artworks contained in French public collections, and found more than half may have to be returned. The head of the museum, Stéphane Martin, criticised the report, saying it sidelined museums in favour of specialists in historical reparations, and stained everything collected and bought during the colonial period with “the impurity of colonial crime”.

Savoy and Sarr reject the idea that clear evidence of the circumstances in which colonial-era items were acquired is difficult to find or ambiguous. “It’s not an argument that works,” said Sarr. “These items were stolen or given or taken during scientific missions.”

Savoy added: “Most of these items arrived in Europe between the 19th and 20th centuries – from 1885 to 1930 – and these are times of great documentation. All of these expeditions are well documented. The issue is accessing them as museums have sat on this material – they have all the documents.”

Savoy and Sarr say in the report that “to speak openly about restitution is to speak of justice, rebalancing, recognition, restoration and reparation. But above all, it is to pave the way for the establishment of new cultural relationships.” For the academics that means stopping “the arrogance of Europeans” and European institutions when dealing with Africa.

“The new ethical relationship is probably the end of the arrogance of Europeans,” said Savoy. “A lot of arguments from Europe are based on the idea that Africans can’t host their own heritage, they don’t have museums, we have saved them etc. Changing this way of relating and this narrative is stepping away from a cultural arrogance.”",British Museum 'has head in sand' over return of artefacts,"arts, culture, entertainment and media",culture,810
358030,newswars,"A seductive (if poorly considered) critique of markets is the notion that they are so wildly unpredictable and inherently unstable that we need government to watch over them and intervene to mitigate their excesses.

There is a great irony in this position which I will reveal.

Economist John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946) made perhaps the most famous case for this view, coining the term “animal spirits” to describe the irrational, impulse-driven whims of market-actors based on arbitrary expectations that could only cause instability. The idea itself seems to make sense because it’s hard for intellectuals, who love chewing over ideas and coming up with bright plans, to see how a society could run coherently without a single plan. The truth is, market economies are actually planned — there is just no central plan. What happens on a market is that lots of individuals make little plans to roll out their bright ideas into businesses, charities, and other organizations, hoping to influence as many people as possible. The plans which prove successful on the small scale attract resources and grow steadily in their impact. Other planners emulate them and adapt their own plans in light of their success. Meanwhile, those plans which prove to be failures never get far off the ground.

This means that, left to their own devices, markets have their own self-correcting mechanisms which Keynes appeared to have overlooked. While in any situation there may be entrepreneurs, investors, and consumers who do indeed make poor or irrational decisions and make mistakes (driven by their animal spirits) there will always be others who succeed as well. The mechanism of profit and loss allocates the pool of available capital to those producers who make good predictions as to what consumers (you and I) want over the long term and reallocate them away from those who use them badly. This limits the scope of damage caused by bad or incompetent decision-makers. Where people fail, the results of those failures will be limited to some small number of people. This can not be said of failures of government which might extend to affecting the entire society.

Now, here’s the irony. Even allowing for Keynes his hypothesis that markets are inherently unstable, how can the prospect of intervention by government, at any time, into the economy do anything but make the market more unpredictable and make it more difficult for the “little planners” to make long-term decisions? Over the course of 20 years a government could change five or more times. With each change in administration the form of state intervention in the economy can change dramatically, as can the political philosophy driving it. Plans can be added or scrapped at any time. Government can increase or reduce taxes at whim, or increase or decrease spending. They can pass new tariffs, grant subsidies, institute licensing laws and regulations or scrap them. Government-mandated central banks (like the Bank of England or the Federal Reserve) can increase or decrease interest rates; expand the money supply or contract it. Plus what makes those calm and virtuous actors themselves immune to the influences of the animal spirits? Do they not too have emotional whims, not to mention voters and campaign contributors to please?

Yes, when the specter of government hangs looming over the economy conditions can rapidly and unpredictably change at any time, in countless ways, and this can only exacerbate the problem that the Keynesians plan to solve. Economist Robert Higgs called this the phenomenon of “Regime Uncertainty,” where investors fear it may be hard or even impossible to foresee the extent to which future government actions will alter the “rules to the game.” As a result, investors become averse to taking risk (much in the way that Keynes feared they might) not due to a lack of government intervention — but in anticipation of it!

Private investors have “skin in the game.” Their own self-interest should motivate them to only take certain risks of personal loss, and investigate all the available information to make robust decisions. But public servants are forever fated to spending other peoples money on other people. The best people at making decisions with money are most likely not in government. They’re probably out there in the free market making “Little Plans” to launch a new business or product that might one day spread out to the furthest reaches of the earth the way mobile phones are now reaching the world’s poorest populations in Africa.",The Instability of Markets Is Not Nearly as Bad as the Instability of Government Policy,politics,government policy,736
3876,activistpost,"Klickitat County, WA — In reaction to the tragic shootings throughout 2018, Washington state has passed and is planning to pass a slew of new anti-gun bills that will make them one of the most regulated states in the country. But these bills are being met by resistance from an unlikely group. A handful of sheriffs is standing up to the “unconstitutional” nature of the bills and is promising disobedience.

Sheriff Bob Songer is one of these sheriffs who is outspoken about his resistance. During an interview with The Guardian, published over the weekend, Songer told the newspaper that the anti-gun legislation passed last November “is unconstitutional on several grounds. I’ve taken the position that as an elected official, I am not going to enforce that law.”

Songer—like every single sheriff and law enforcement officer in the country—swore an oath to uphold the Constitution, and now he’s overtly honoring it by protecting the Second Amendment.

Songer also cited ongoing litigation by the National Rife Association gun industry lobby and others which aims to demonstrate the laws violate both the second amendment and the state’s constitution. He also said that if other agencies attempted to seize weapons from county residents under the auspices of the new laws, he would consider preventively “standing in their doorway”. In November, the state’s voters handily passed an initiative, I-1639, which mostly targeted semi-automatic rifles. As of 1 January, purchasers of these weapons must now be over 21, undergo an enhanced background check, must have completed a safety course, and need to wait 9 days to take possession of their weapon. Also, gun owners who fail to store their weapons safely risk felony “community endangerment” charges. Feeling the wind at their backs after the ballot, gun campaigners and liberal legislators have now gone even further in the new legislative session. Bills introduced in the last week to Washington’s Democrat-dominated legislature look to further restrict firearms. Some laws would ban high capacity magazines and plastic guns made with 3D printers. Others would mandate training for concealed carry permits, and remove guns and ammo during and after domestic violence incidents.

The sheriff of Ferry County agrees with Songer and is also promising not to enforce the laws. Sheriff Ray Maycumber told The Guardian that he will resist the legislation as well.

Police officers standing up for the gun rights of the citizens they serve is rare, but it has happened before. In Connecticut in 2014, legislators passed into law highly restrictive gun control, gun bans, and bans on high capacity magazines.

The laws were so overreaching and unconstitutional that hundreds of law enforcement officers came together to resist it.

At the time, 250 law enforcement officers in Connecticut signed an open letter stating that they will not enforce the new anti-gun and magazine laws, which they considered to be a violation of the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

Also, some entire towns—law enforcement officials and politicians alike—have moved to become “sanctuary cities” for gun rights in the wake of the recent anti-gun legislation sweeping the country.

As TFTP reported last year, in Effingham County, IL, the town board voted in April to order its employees not to enforce any laws that would “unconstitutionally restrict the Second Amendment” to the U.S. Constitution.

Effingham County State’s Attorney Bryan Kibler said the measure is meant to act as a warning shot to tell the state legislature that the county does not want unnecessary gun control measures, or for the sale of firearms to be jeopardized. The resolution states:

The Right of the People to Keep and Bear Arms is guaranteed as an Individual Right under the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and under the Constitution of the State of Illinois, and; the Right of the People to Keep and Bear Arms for defense of Life, Liberty, and Property is regarded as an Inalienable Right by the People of Effingham County, Illinois, and the People of Effingham County, Illinois, derive economic benefit from all safe forms of firearms recreation, hunting, and shooting conducted within Effingham County using all types of firearms allowable under the United States Constitution.

As TFTP has reported, some sheriffs have even gone so far as to encourage citizens to arm themselves, noting that a well armed society is a safer society. “In light of recent events that have occurred in the United States and around the world I want to encourage citizens of Ulster County who are licensed to carry a firearm to PLEASE DO SO,” urged Sheriff Paul Van Blarcum of New York’s Ulster County in a Facebook post, after the Paris massacre in 2015. “I think it’s important to remind everybody with the way things are, you’ve got people coming in with long rifles just slaughtering people,” Van Blarcum told the Daily Freeman newspaper. He is hoping that next time an incident of that kind occurs, “there is an armed citizen around” to respond. Detroit Police Chief James Craig, agreed, and explaining that police cannot be everywhere all the time, he noted that “if you’re a terrorist, or a car-jacker, you want unarmed citizens.”  Indeed, as we have long contended here at the Free Thought Project, the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. Sheriffs who continue to acknowledge this and stand up for the rights of citizens to protect themselves, deserve to be recognized. Please share this story in hopes that other law enforcement officers across the country may take similar stances—as true change comes when good people disobey bad laws.

938889,thesun,"STAR WARS fans were feeling the force after J.J. Abrams confirmed that filming on Episode 9 has wrapped.

A behind-the-scenes shot of Rey, Finn and Poe left fans hoping that a first-look trailer for the highly-anticipated conclusion to the Skywalker saga will arrive soon.

In the latest snap, the heroic trio - played by Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac - can be seen in a desert landscape and the picture has kickstarted a stream of theories.

Fans are now speculating that the big finale battle will take place on either Rey's home planet of Jakku or on the streets of Tattooine - home to both Anakin and Luke Skywalker.

Eagle-eyed viewers also noted how despite training in the ways of the Jedi, Rey is holding her staff instead of a typical lightsaber hilt, leading several fans to think she could have turned the primitive weapon into a double-edged lightsaber.

Director J.J. Abrams told followers: ""It feels impossible, but today wrapped photography on Episode IX. There is no adequate way to thank this truly magical crew and cast. I'm forever indebted to you all.""

John Boyega - who plays hero Finn in the movies - shared the image on his own social media, explaining that it was the ""end of a chapter.""

The 26-year-old told fans: ""That's a wrap on Star Wars episode 9 and the end to a chapter of my life that I couldn't be more thankful for. What a process!

""It really has been a joy to be in these movies surrounded by amazing people. JJ thank you for making my dreams come true.""

Fans were later sent into hyperspace when the official Star Wars UK account tweeted: ""The calm before the galactic storm.""

Chewbacca actor Joonas Suotamo also shared a heartfelt message to celebrate the end of filming.

He tweeted: ""Yesterday was a wrap for me. A huge furry thank you to all of the cast and crew of Star Wars Episode IX.

""What a bittersweet thing it is to end this trilogy, this life-changing chapter of my life. And finally thank you @JJAbrams for giving me this opportunity. Rawrrggh!""

The 32-year-old Finnish actor also shared a candid shot from the wrap party with John Boyega.

Fans flocked to comment with many begging J.J. to announce the movie's full title in a desperate bid to learn more about the highly-secretive plot.

Many expected a first-look to be unveiled at this month's SuperBowl event, but nothing materialised.

Hollywood icon Carrie Fisher will posthumously reprise her role as Leia Organa for the concluding movie after producers revealed they will use footage shot before her tragic 2016 death.

It was previously confirmed that while Episode 9 will conclude the story of the Skywalker family, there will be more Star Wars movies to follow including a new trilogy and more spin-off instalments.

More news is almost certain to be officially confirmed at Star Wars Celebration - an annual convention that will this year be held in Chicago and will feature cast panel discussions.

688449,theguardianuk,"Mohammed’s tattoo studio is hidden in a back room behind a clothes shop in the poorer, southern part of Tehran. Photos of Al Pacino, Che Guevara and the Eiffel Tower adorn the walls. His customers often ask for classic tattoo motifs – a rose, for example, or a predatory animal – but Maori-style tribal patterns are also popular. “Tattooing is my passion,” he says. “I take the risk simply because it’s so beautiful.”

He certainly does take a risk. Tattoo artists are regularly arrested in Iran and sentenced to fines, lashes or even imprisonment. While there is no specific law against tattoos and they are not strictly forbidden in Shia Islam, the authorities strongly reject them as a western phenomenon harmful to Iranian values.

In some public places, like swimming pools, there are signs warning that tattooed people are not welcome. When criminals are arrested, newspapers invariably publish photos of their body art to convey the message that tattoos and crime go hand in hand. Football players with tattooed arms have been forced to wear long sleeves.

Yet body art is immensely popular among young people in Tehran. Among the clientele of the trendy cafes in the city centre are many people with visible tattoos. And everywhere in town you’ll find underground studios like Mohammed’s. Some are located in back rooms behind shops or in beauty parlours where women go for permanent makeup such as eyeliner – the only form of tattooing the authorities allow. Others receive their clients at home. They often have difficulty finding good equipment.

Mohammed, who is 27, started 10 years ago with the machine his mother used for permanent makeup. He saw tattoos becoming a craze among young, urban Iranians about seven years ago. “The internet was an important factor. People saw it on social media and decided they wanted it, too,” he says.

“My clients say that tattoos make them feel more themselves. They feel more beautiful and stronger. A man feels more powerful when he’s got a dragon tattooed on his back.”

Reza Arjmand, a sociologist at the University of Lund in Sweden, has done extensive research into the new tattoo culture in Iran and collected more than 5,000 photos. His book The Subversive Skin: Tattoo in Post-Revolutionary Iran will be published this year.

“Tattoos are not new in Iran,” he says. “But it used to be something for the lower classes – men who had been to prison and women in prostitution. The new trend is for hip, young people. It’s cool to have one. It’s a fashion thing and a status symbol. Between the photos I collected are images of women who have exactly the same tattoo as Beyoncé or some other celebrity on exactly the same spot.”

But it is certainly not simply a fashion choice for everybody, he adds. “For some Iranians it’s a way to show that their body belongs to them, apart from the theocratic state and institutionalised religion. It’s a silent act of resistance. You can censor books, you can ban films, but you cannot erase a tattoo very easily.”

According to Arjmand, the new trend shows that the dynamic of Iranian society is changing. “For these young people the points of reference are no longer the mosque and the mullahs, but Hollywood and social media. Rihanna sets the trend.”

Tattoos are popular among young women and there are many female tattoo artists in Tehran, such as Atefeh, 36-year-old visual artist. She became interested when she saw a Chinese tattoo of a flower online. “I thought it was gorgeous. I had never seen anything like it,” she says. “As a kind of test I tattooed it on my leg. It wasn’t perfect, but I knew I wanted to continue.”

She is aware of the risk of being a tattooist, but the current economic problems in Iran make it very difficult for her to sell her paintings. “With tattooing, I can earn more money. And the money I earn, I invest in my art projects.”

She receives her clients, mainly young women, in her living room. “Some want a tattoo because they think it’s sexy, or because their husband thinks it’s sexy,” she says. “They want me to tattoo his name, for example. Lines of poetry or philosophical sayings are also very popular. And Persian calligraphy. But not everybody does it because they think it’s sexy or cool. I also have clients who want Qur’anic verses on their bodies.”

Mahsa, 24, sits in a cafe in the city centre. She has piercings in her nose and ears and several tattoos on her arms, some of which she has done herself. Most conspicuous is the image of a big eye on her neck. “It was always my dream to have tattoos, from when I was nine,” she says. “I don’t like jewellery. This is forever and I think that’s beautiful.”

It’s not easy to look like her in Iran. This year’s Berlin film festival will show an Iranian short about a young woman who goes to renew her driving licence but is sent to a police station for her body art.

“I get many negative reactions,” Mahsa says. “I hide my tattoos when I walk through the city, because it can be dangerous. People can associate the one on my neck with the evil eye and see it as a satanic thing. But it has nothing to do with that. I just think it’s beautiful.”

Asked why she is prepared to run such risks, she says: “This is just who I am and it’s nobody’s business but mine.”

Tattoo artist Soheil Aflaki, 28, sees tattoos as a way to stand out in a society that allows people little space for self-expression. His living room in a suburb of Tehran also serves as his tattoo studio. “I consider tattooing as a medical treatment for my generation,” he says. “It’s a way to heal the psychological wounds you sustain while living in a culture in crisis.”

Aflaki started out as a self-taught painter. His interest in tattooing was sparked when a friend gave him a tattoo machine for his 19th birthday. “I learned to do it by trial and error,” he says, and laughs. “I was lucky to have friends who let me practise on their bodies.”

He is now one of the best-known tattoo artists in Tehran, with more than 55,000 followers on Instagram. Among his clients are famous Iranian musicians and actors. They don’t come for roses or tribal patterns, but for Aflaki’s unique designs, which are often inspired by the character of his clients.

“It’s my art that’s important to me and nothing else,” he says. “There are many other things that are not allowed in Iran, like graffiti, rock music and hip-hop. But in spite of that, many Iranians dedicate their lives to them. We all knew the situation when we started and we have come to terms with it. I don’t complain about it.”

He adds: “A tattoo functions as an ‘identity maker’. It’s a way to create a unique personality. I think that’s important for young people in a country like Iran.”

499100,sottnet,"In 1992, the ethics committee of the Montreal Neurological Institute at McGill University accused neurology and neurosurgery professor Justine Sergent of failing to properly obtain their approval for her work using radioactive isotopes to study the brain function of pianists. Sergent claimed no wrongdoing other than, at most, a technical mistake of not re-requesting specific approval to study pianists reading sheet music when she had already received approval to use the same technology to study brain function in people reacting to images of human faces. The following year she was officially reprimanded for the alleged breach but filed an appeal in arbitration.Over the next two years, Sergent's dispute with the ethics committee grew bitter and she claimed it was based on personal grievances and not on the validity of her work. Sergent fought to defend herself and the integrity of her work but the stream of pettiness aimed at her increased. In an attempt to further tarnish her, an anonymous source (presumably from within McGill), mailed a letter to the Montreal Gazette accusing her of fraud in her scientific practice.The Gazette then published an article entitled ""Researcher Disciplined by McGill for Breaking Rules."" Shortly after the Gazette published this article, Sergent wrote a letter in which she stated that her love of research was too great to ever consider tampering with data. She defended the quality of her work and stated:On April 11 1994, with the assistance of her husband Yves Sergent, Justine Sergent committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning from a motor vehicle that was parked in her garage with a hose running from the tailpipe and into the window of the car. Yves Sergent then composed his last letter:Yves Sergent returned to the car and sat in the drivers seat. He attempted to slit his own throat but failed to hit an artery. He later died, like Justine Sergent, from carbon monoxide poisoning.On April 12 1994, Justine and Yves Sergent were found dead in their garage sitting beside each other in the drivers and passenger seats of their car. This is the devastating power that an academic mobbing can have on its targets.In a 2016 article for University Affairs entitled ""Academic Mobbing, Or How To Become Campus Tormentors,"" Eve Seguin wrote, ""Mobbing is social murder and, by definition, people cannot survive their own murder.""We would be hard-pressed to find people in society deserving of punishment so severe that those who receive it take their own lives. This in itself makes academic mobbing an inhumane act. The deaths of Justine and Yves Sergent were not isolated extremes;Kenneth Westhues professor Emeritus of Sociology at the University of Waterloo has become an internationally recognized authority on academic mobbing and defines it as In 2004, Dr Janice Harper was halfway to tenure in the University of Houston's Department of Anthropology when she was lured away by an offer from the University of Tennessee Knoxville to go there and build up their cultural anthropology program. At UTK Dr Harper would begin research on two ambitious projects that would require an unflinching look at the damage done to powerless people by powerful entities. The first was a study of the town of Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which played a pivotal role in the Manhattan Project, and the second was a study on the use of depleted uranium in munitions which she planned to publish as a book with Left Coast Books, Weapons of Dust: The Cultural and Scientific Battlefields of Depleted Uranium.The gender divides in the department were palpable and Dr Harper found herself subjected to a common problem women face in the workplace: men could speak openly at faculty meetings but when she presented a contradictory opinion to her male colleagues she was accused of complaining.""I was on the forefront of change and trying to get women hired,"" Dr Harper said. ""I was an outspoken woman in a department that did not have a history of outspoken women, or pretty much any woman at all. Since its founding in the midcentury, the department had only tenured two women, one of whom left and the other retired.""In 2007, after Dr Harper filed an allegation of sexual harassment against a colleague at UTK, she became socially isolated in her department. Her classrooms were moved from week to week; she was removed from all committee assignments and not notified of faculty meetings. Just a few weeks earlier her Department Chair had written that she was ""indispensable to the department,"" but after she reported her concerns to him about the employee, he told her that because she had made her report, he could no longer support her for tenure.Dr Harper confided in a colleague that the social isolation and uncertainty were making her feel suicidal and, although she assured her colleague she would not take her life, the colleague reported to the university that Dr Harper was ""making death threats."" She was then interrogated by campus police as a possible threat to the safety of students, which resulted in her file being forwarded to the FBI Department of Homeland security along with accusations that she was possibly a nuclear terrorist.Shortly thereafter, Dr Harper was interrogated by the FBI as a possible threat to the safety of faculty. ""At one point, they were interrogating me about my 'obsession' with bombs, asking questions like, 'Do you always make a habit of talking about bombs in your classes?' to which I replied, 'Would that be in my class on warfare or my class on the atomic bomb?'""The allegations against Harper were largely based on testimony that her department head solicited from two students; one claimed that Dr Harper might have been planning to build a hydrogen bomb to blow up the campus stadium. The student cited a lecture Dr Harper had given in which she explained the difference between acts of violence that destroy infrastructure opposed to ones that destroy an important symbol within a culture. She said that if someone bombed the Stadium on the UT campus, it would be an act of symbolic destruction because it would not affect the infrastructure of the campus.The other student alleged that Dr Harper's then ten-year-old daughter had threatened the life of her Department Head (who happened to be a diabetic) by joking that she intended to bake him a batch of chocolate cookies.In what appears to read like a Hollywood comedy, the UT Police Report reads as follows:Harper fought UTK and despite the absurd nature of the allegations levelled against her, her department successfully cast her out by denying her tenure. Harper followed with a lawsuit but couldn't hold out financially and was forced to settle out of court.Those thrown out of the academy must transition from living within the security of their dream job to suddenly trying to find their place in society with no income, no health care, and serious health issues such as PTSD, depression, anxiety, and often more serious health complications that stem from trauma. The damage runs deep and the health implications are severe.""First there's the shock,"" Harper later wrote in her book Mobbed! In a recent interview Dr Harper said:As traumatic and damaging as the experience was, Dr Harper applied her anthropological expertise to understanding the social processes that led so many people to rapidly turn against her once the decision was made to cast her out. As the mobbing intensified, she continued teaching courses on warfare and genocide, and began to note parallels between how people are persuaded to turn against their neighbors and fellow citizens in genocidal contexts, and how people in any group setting can be persuaded to join in dehumanizing and abusing someone marked by leadership for exclusion and destruction.The result of her work was a series of articles in The Huffington Post and Psychology Today, as well as a book, Mobbed! What to Do When They Really Are Out to Get You , in which she challenged the anti-bullying movement's focus on ""the difficult employee"" or ""evil bully,"" and called instead for a focus on the group psychology that leads otherwise good people to inhumanely attack another person without terms or limits.By examining primate and other animal behavior, along with witchcraft accusations, the McCarthy era, and the mid-eighties hysteria that led daycare workers to be accused and convicted of impossible feats of child sexual abuse,""Ultimately, mobbing didn't break me. It made me,"" Harper said. ""It taught me a great deal about myself and others and made me a far more patient and compassionate person. But it's a cruelty and violence that is both unnecessary and far more damaging than I think even the attackers can imagine.""In her essay ""The Anatomy of an Academic Mobbing,"" Joan Friedenberg states that ""most mobbers see their actions as perfectly justified by the perceived depravity of their target, at least until they are asked to account for it with some degree of thoughtfulness, such as in a court deposition, by a journalist or in a judicial hearing.""The flip side to the depravity of the target is the righteousness of the mob. What makes members of the mob so passionately inhumane is that their position as righteous becomes instantly wrapped up in the successful destruction of the target. As Friedenberg writes ""An unsuccessful account leaves the mobber entirely morally culpable.""Every effort will be made to increase the allegation count, magnify the severity of each accusation, reinterpret any past actions of the target as malicious, and wipe away any sign that the target ever had a single redeemable quality that could point to the fact that they are undeserving of total destruction and shunning. For this reason ""bullying"" is a common accusation levelled against mobbing targets. As Dr Harper warns targets in Mobbed! No matter how educated or enlightened a person may think they are, when faced with the primal nature of a mobbing most people will betray their own principles and move to the safety of power. The people most closely associated with the target may then become the target's fiercest attackers since there is no better way to create distance from the primal danger of a mob than to attack with vigor. Once they begin attacking their own identity as righteous then becomes intertwined with the depravity of the target....I am going to tell you that the closer people are to you-as a friend-the more likely they will turn against you. They will prove to be extremely aggressive.""Of course, mobbings also have devastating effects on the families of those who are mobbed. If members of a mob believe that they are righteously punishing a single person then they have no understanding of the collective force with which they are attacking not just an individual but also those closest to that individual, such as spouses like Yves Sargent or children like Dr Harper's daughter.""My daughter went through major trauma at the fear of not knowing where we were moving,"" Dr Harper said, ""Trauma at having seen people she considered her godparents, not to mention her babysitter (one of the students to make the allegation that Dr Harper was building an H-Bomb), turn me over to the police and FBI, watch me interrogated by the FBI. And now she has virtually no memory of me as a professor.""""Things have worked out well for her,"" Dr Harper said, ""but she still bears the scars. So many people end up divorced, or their spouses endure the depression and anger they can no longer understand. So when you write about what happens to us, remember what happens to our families.""Brad Cran served as the Poet Laureate for The City of Vancouver from 2009-2011.",Primal Behavior: The Academic Mob and its fatal toll,"crime, law and justice",judiciary,1932
385514,npr,"Hot Job Market Is Wooing Women Into Workforce Faster Than Men

Gaby Gemetti thought she was failing. After having a second child, she struggled to be a good mom and also a good employee.

""I felt like I wasn't a good mother,"" she says. ""I was waking up in the middle of the night thinking about, 'Oh, my presentation,' or just work in general.""

So, even though Gemetti was moving up the management ranks at a top tech company in Silicon Valley, she gave up the job four years ago to stay home in Santa Clara, Calif. As hard as it was, Gemetti's decision was particularly driven by her son's needs, when he started requiring regular therapy.

But she missed working on team projects. And recent headlines spotlighting the need for women in technology piqued her interest in looking for a job again. So she got back to work.

Over the past three years, women in their working prime such as Gemetti have been entering the workforce at more than double the rate of men.

Don't see the graphic above? Click here.

That recent rise comes at a time when the economy is humming along and the unemployment rate has reached historic lows, which means there are more opportunities for workers seeking higher pay and better benefits.

Those benefits appeal to working mothers like Gemetti. In March, she started a ""returnship,"" a new type of program to recruit and retrain women like her who are looking to resume their careers. The new gig, managing a team at Cisco Systems, gives her time to occasionally pick up her kids from school.

Women returning to jobs at higher rates since 2015 dramatically reverses the trend of the previous three years, when women were leaving the workforce at twice the rate of men. It is also a reversal of a nearly two-decade drop in the percentage of working women.

During World War II, women started entering the labor force in large numbers. That trend didn't stop for decades. Until 2000. Then it started to dip — a decline that continued through the Great Recession and ended in 2015.

Now, many employers are struggling to find workers and are trying to lure them with more family-friendly benefits, such as flexible hours and paid leave. That's attractive to women, who continue to remain the primary caregivers for children and elderly parents.

There are other things contributing to the expanding female workforce — the growth of industries such as health care and education that rely heavily on women, for example.

Women also are making inroads in historically male-dominated fields such as manufacturing and construction, says Martha Gimbel, research director at the job site Indeed, an NPR sponsor.

""In a tight labor market, employers are willing to look at applicants that they might have dismissed in the past,"" she says.

Another draw for women: Employers competing for workers are paying more. But is it enough, given a number of other financial barriers to women working?

Their return to work means there is greater demand for child care, which is harder to find. And, unlike Canada and Europe, the U.S. doesn't subsidize child care.

""If a woman has a relatively low hourly wage, maybe it makes more sense for her to take care of her own children,"" says Claudia Goldin, an economics professor at Harvard University who researches women in the workforce — even if that means earning less later in life when a woman goes back to work.

""Can wage growth support workers paying for more expensive child care?"" Gimbel asks.

The employment gains American women have made in recent years pale in comparison to countries such as Canada and Sweden, where a higher percentage of women work.

""This is a real indication that there's something wrong,"" Goldin says.

Women in the U.S. face greater financial headwinds. Much of that is tied to their role as default caregivers in many families. Paid time off to care for children and sick family members remains relatively rare. Some cities and states require it, but federal law does not.

That makes it harder to keep a job.

There's another disincentive, Goldin says: Married women with working spouses are taxed at a higher rate.

The calculation to work, or not, is personal and practical. But that choice has also long been judged and criticized as a subject of culture wars. In the 1980s, it centered on ""latchkey children"" — kids of working parents who unlocked their own homes after school and looked after themselves.

The #MeToo movement reignited workplace debates, including inequity in pay and women's representation in executive ranks. Many employers are now trying to address that.

They're adding retraining and mentorship programs to encourage women to return, and are explicitly recruiting women, says Sonu Ratra. She took a career break and founded a staffing firm and a job-placement and support group called Women Back to Work.

""There has been a cultural shift in the last two years,"" Ratra says. ""Women are being celebrated more today than ever.""

And that shift isn't just felt by women.

When Gaby Gemetti decided to go back to work, both she and her husband shifted their schedules.

""We were like, 'Oh God, child care. What are we going to do about the kids?' "" she says.

Gemetti is fortunate. Her mother and a part-time sitter can pick up the children from school most days, while Gemetti and her husband alternate on others. But between her daughter's swimming and dancing lessons and her son's baseball practices, it's still a daily logistical challenge.

That juggle hasn't gotten any easier, she says: ""Practice is at 5:30, so you have to leave work at 4:30 in order to get them ready to scramble, and then what are you going to do about dinner?""

It's all part of the calculus Gemetti and other women are making as they return to the workforce.",Hot Job Market Is Wooing Women Into Workforce Faster Than Men,labour,labour relations,950

Les Hoey’s DreamMaker Foundation – which arranges treats for children with life-threatening diseases – received a cheque for £2700 from FSG/Goldstar Promotions.

The company, part-owned by businessman Francis Gilluley who runs the popular Fighting Scots Gym in Bellshill, puts on sporting events all year round, with proceeds from ticket sales and auctions being donated to the good cause.

Such events in 2018 included evenings with boxing legends Tommy ‘The Hitman’ Hearns, Tyson Fury and Roy Jones Junior, as well as football nights with former Rangers manager Walter Smith, and ex-players Lee McCulloch, Ian Durrant and Barry Ferguson. A further £600 will also be donated following the auction of a signed Mike Tyson boxing glove last month.

Francis explained: “We host a number of events throughout the year and work closely with Les Hoey and his DreamMaker Foundation, supporting and promoting the wonderful work they do for children across Lanarkshire and the wider Glasgow area.

“We met with Les prior to Christmas to hand over the cheque for £2700.

“However, we were also delighted to host our annual Boxing Day auction 

 of a signed Mike Tyson boxing glove, which raised a further £600 for the charity.

“We look forward to continuing our relationship with the charity in 2019.”

Meanwhile, the next FSG event set to take place with proceeds for the charity, is an evening with former Celtic managers Neil Lennon – who is currently at the helm at Hibs – and Gordon Strachan.

The church has become a home for her and nearly 1,000 others from different faiths as they wait out the aftermath of Mozambique's latest devastating cyclone.

Situated in the heart of this predominantly Muslim but diverse city ravaged by Cyclone Kenneth, the Maria Auxiliadora parish houses those displaced by the storm in Cabo Delgado, Mozambique's northernmost province.

""We don't ask about people's religions, human life is all we value,"" Father Ricardo Filipe Rosa Marques, the 41-year-old priest in charge, told AP news agency.

The government has said 41 people have died after the cyclone made landfall on Thursday, and the humanitarian situation in Pemba and other areas is dire.

More than 55 centimetres of rain have fallen in Pemba since Kenneth arrived just six weeks after Cyclone Idai tore into central Mozambique.

This is the first time two cyclones have struck the country in a single season, and Kenneth was the first cyclone recorded so far north in Mozambique in the era of satellite imaging.

The danger is not over. More rain was expected and rivers were expected to reach flood stage by Thursday, the United Nations humanitarian office has said, citing a UK aid analysis. It is the end of the rainy season and rivers already were running high.

Shelter is a top priority for most cyclone survivors and this is what the church is providing, promoting itself as a safe space even before the storm.

In a region where little-known Muslim armed groups have reportedly killed dozens of people in recent months, a certain amount of tension might be expected. But for some, what matters most is shelter.

""I had never been in a church before ... but as long as I am safe I don't mind,"" said Aamilah Felciano, who is Muslim. ""It doesn't mean I have abandoned my faith, I am just saving my life.""

The church has suspended mass and other routine programmes. There is no space or time for such activities, the priest said.

""There can be no better mass than giving people shelter and hope. That is the church's mission,"" he said. 

 Women and children have taken up residence inside the main hall. The few belongs they could carry as they fled, mainly clothing and plastic buckets, are tucked close by.

Children climb over the pulpit and the priest's chair, playing. In one corner a woman breastfeeds her baby. Church pews have been turned into washing lines.

Outside, shielded from the pounding rains, girls and boys take turns stirring huge pots of rice and soup.

As nightfall approaches, people prepare reed mats or pieces of cloth. Some will sleep on the bare floor. Men sleep on the hall's balcony.

More than 900 displaced people are sheltering here, while about 200 others are staying at church centres elsewhere in the city, according to Joao Paulo, an official with Caritas, a Catholic relief agency.

Some people are still arriving. But getting people to leave their homes was not easy at first.

""The difficulty was that a lot of people here are Muslims, some said they cannot stay in a Catholic church,"" said the priest, Rosa Marques, adding: ""Some refused and preferred to stay at their homes. My heart broke because these people chose to face death over safety.""

But there are few religious tensions among city residents, he said, and many of the people arriving at the church with food, medicine and other aid are Muslim. ""It is not as difficult as in other areas,"" he said.

As he spoke, the Muslim call to prayer blared from speakers at one of the numerous mosques nearby, and people left the church to pray.

Kenneth is not the first calamity to bring people of different faiths together in the province. When the Muslim armed groups intensified their attacks on local communities last year, Muslims and Christians organised joint prayer meetings and opened an inter-faith dialogue centre, the priest said.

""People here have suffered a lot. They have been through (Portuguese) colonialism, civil war and the recent killings. They have been living with scars for years yet their love and sense of sharing is amazing,"" he said.

""I am learning from them. The people here are teaching me how to be a true priest.""",Mozambique church a refuge for Muslim cyclone survivors,religion and belief,religious conflict,702
649879,thedailyrecord,"Two members of a ""callous"" puppy farming gang have been jailed for selling dogs they fraudulently claimed were bred in a family environment, when they were actually ""sickly and diseased"", with some dying within days of being sold.

Norwich Crown Court heard that the puppies were advertised for sale as being healthy, socialised and treated for worms and fleas.

But when police raided one of their premises in 2017 they found dogs in cages, some in ""pitch-dark sheds with no access to light"" and others ""in a caravan at temperatures of up to 30C"", prosecutor Hazel Stevens said.

""They were being bred in a commercial environment, not in a family home as advertised,"" she added.

Michael Rushmer, 27, of Thurlton, Norfolk, his sister Zoe Rushmer, 26, of no fixed address, and her partner Jacob Murphy, 27, of Norton Subcourse, all admitted conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation between June 1, 2016 and June 18, 2018.

Michael Rushmer admitted continuing the offending while on bail for the offence, pleading guilty to a further count of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation between July 15, 2018, and March 16, 2019.

Michael Rushmer and Murphy were both jailed for three years and six months.

Zoe Rushmer was given a two-year prison sentence suspended for two years and ordered to complete 250 hours of unpaid work.

Judge Andrew Shaw told the mother-of-four: ""It's your children and only your children that have spared you from going to prison.""

All three defendants were also disqualified from ""owning, keeping or otherwise dealing with dogs for life"", and they cannot appeal against this ruling for at least 10 years.

He said the fraud, which began ""at least as early as 2015"", ""strikes at the very heart of this nation's love for its pets, dogs in particular"".

""A family's decision to buy a puppy is not one that is ever taken lightly,"" he said, adding that ""to sell people sickly and diseased dogs, so poorly that many do not survive, is about as callous and meanspirited a fraud as I have come across for some time"".

He described Murphy as the ""ringleader"", Michael Rushmer as ""his deputy if not his equal"" and Zoe Rushmer as ""the legitimate face of your brother's and partner's criminal enterprise"" who ""even lent her own children to the affair as part of her efforts to lend a veneer of respectability"" to what they were doing.

Ms Stevens said that the dogs had an average price of £675 and the gang made £300,000 from the fraud, though they claimed it was nearer £150,000.

She said: ""When visiting, buyers were often met by a female and there were often children present, giving the impression of a family they (the puppies) were supposed to be part of.""

Statements were taken from 31 purchasers who described how their puppies ""looked lifeless and ill"", and some died within days of getting home after they were diagnosed with parvovirus, a highly contagious disease.

One buyer was told by the sellers that their puppy died ""due to their negligence"" and were refused help with their £2,000 vet bill, Ms Stevens said.

""These defendants exploited the emotional vulnerability of potential purchasers, especially those who attended with children to see the potential new member of their family,"" she said.

She added: ""This fraudulent activity succeeds as the people who want to buy these small-type breeds, or cross-breeds, want to do something for their family, and because once they see the dog they want to rescue it or buy it.

""Once they've fallen in love with the puppy, regardless of the circumstances nine times out of 10 they buy the puppy, even if they think something is going on.""

She described it as a ""sophisticated offence"" which required ""significant planning"", with defendants using false names and addresses and multiple SIM cards so different phone numbers could be used in adverts.

Barrister Andrew Oliver said in mitigation that Michael Rushmer took over the business from his late father, started to use cocaine and made the ""foolish decision"" to buy dogs from travellers, which introduced parvovirus to the farm.

Zoe Rushmer was remorseful and Jacob Murphy was trying to fund his drug habit, the court heard.

Michael Rushmer also admitted 10 animal welfare offences, and operating a pet shop and breeding establishment without a licence.

Zoe Rushmer admitted four animal welfare offences and Murphy admitted three.

Jean Boyes, 67, also admitted conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation between June 1, 2016 and June 18, 2018, but the court heard her role was limited to taking a litter of seven puppies to be inoculated on a single occasion.

Boyes, whose given address is The Street, Bramerton, but the court heard was now living in a car, was given a two-year conditional discharge.

RSPCA inspector Amy Pellegrini, lead investigator, described the farm as a ""puppy factory"".

She added: ""The way the adverts were worded suggested to prospective purchasers that these were litters of home-bred puppies in good health and were well-socialised.

""The reality, sadly, was far from it and the sellers were running a commercial, unlicensed puppy farm on an industrial scale.""",Callous puppy farmers sold sickly and diseased dogs which died within days,health,non-human diseases,828

A team from the University of North Carolina Wilmington Marine Mammal Stranding Programme were called to the Island where the whale was discovered, and described as ""very, very thin.""

After the marine mammal was sedated, an onsite volunteer vet made the decision to euthanise it, before a necropsy (animal autopsy) was carried out.

During the necropsy, a black plastic rubbish bag was found in the mouth of the whale.

Ann Pabst, a member of the Programme, told WECT6 News: “It was just a piece of trash that the animal found in the water.

""It’s so important to be really careful about what we put in the water because what we put in the water can end up in the mouth of a whale.""

She added she did not think the bag was the cause of death, but said it ""didn't help the animal in its debilitated state.""

Robbie Johnson, who was at the scene when the whale was discovered, posted on Facebook that the event was ""life changing"" for him.

In an emotional post, he said: ""It was very emotional looking into the eye of the magnificent mammal, yet pales in comparison to what I have felt now that I've had a couple of days to absorb and look at photos of her.""

At 8:17 on Sunday morning, he said the wind gusts were getting scary at the schoolhouse in Marsh Harbor on the Bahamas' Great Abaco Island, where he was hunkered down, waiting for one of the most destructive hurricanes in the islands' history to make landfall.

""I feel like a rocket is about to take off,"" he wrote to his 80,000 Twitter followers, amassed during his long career as a tempest chaser known for capturing harrowing eyewitness video.

Morgerman's account was dark for the next day, and then the next day after that.

Online, people wished him luck and implored him to stay safe.

On the ground, Abaco was at the time one of the most unlucky, unsafe places in the hemisphere.

For nearly two days -- from a few hours after Morgerman's final tweet until Tuesday afternoon -- Dorian ceaselessly slammed the Bahamas with a catastrophic combination: winds that whipped at 185 mph, in a storm that crept along, maximizing its devastation.

And the school where Morgerman took refuge was in one of the country's hardest-hit regions.

For a short while this week, no one heard from him, even as his friends and fellow pursuers posted updates of their own. The storm passed, but rumors swirled. He was feared dead.

Then, at 5:52 Tuesday evening, the Weather Channel's Twitter account published a photo of Morgerman, brows raised and eyes sunken. ""We are in contact with Hurricane Chaser Josh Morgerman,"" the post read. ""He is safe.""

The Washington Post could not reach Morgerman that night.

But some 15 minutes later, he began tweeting again. He had made it out of the storm and into Nassau, the Bahamian capital. But he brought with him a terrifying story.

""Yep, I'm alive,"" he began in a series of posts, 54 hours after going dark. ""By far the most intense cyclone I've witnessed in 28 years of chasing. Thought I was playing it safe by riding it out in a solid-concrete school on a hill in Marsh Harbour. Thought wrong.""

""Winds pounded the building with the force of a thousand sledgehammers,"" he added.

In an interview with the Weather Channel from Nassau, Morgerman recounted the most ferocious moments.

""Everything turned white,"" he said. ""It was just solid white and a roaring sound ... It was like we were in a washing machine during the maximum winds -- and that's what I really remember about this hurricane, just this unbelievable blizzard-like whiteout.""

After that, the school was mostly destroyed, and there was more storm to come. Without shelter, Dorian could be deadly. But Morgerman and others inside the building had caught one break: They were, at that moment, in the eye of the hurricane -- a tranquil but fleeting respite from a ferocious vortex.

They took their chance to flee, driving to a government building that was filled with new refugees.

It's also why he chose that locale. Morgerman said he wanted to get as close to the eye as he could, a front-row seat for the archipelago's most brutal show.

His and other stories that began to emerge from the island nation as the storm moved north serve as the first accounts of a historic event. Dorian flattened buildings, perhaps leveling entire towns. It has claimed seven lives, but government officials expect the toll to rise much higher. It could define the Bahamas for decades.

""Whole neighborhoods were swept by mighty surge higher than anything in memory,"" Morgerman wrote in a final plea Tuesday. ""Areas above water had catastrophic wind damage. Many deaths reported from drowning, flying debris, & collapsing houses. Medical clinic overwhelmed. An absolute catastrophe. SEND HELP TO ABACO ISLANDS.""

In aerial footage taken after the storm passed, the cameramen narrate the island's desolation, pointing out landmarks no longer visible beneath torrents of floodwater.

FCA confirmed in a press statement that it reached a deal with the union but did not release further details.

A statement on the UAW's website says the union will not be releasing details of the agreement until UAW-FCA Council members have had a chance to meet and review them.

""Our UAW Bargaining Committee worked diligently, over many months, during the General Motors strike and Ford negotiations to maintain productive negotiations with FCA,"" said UAW Vice President Cindy Estrada, who directs the union's UAW-FCA department.

""The pattern bargaining strategy has been a very effective approach for the UAW and its members to negotiate economic gains around salary, benefits and job security. In addition to the $4.5 billion in major investments previously announced, negotiators secured an additional $4.5 billion for a total of $9 billion of investments adding 7,900 jobs during the contract period.""

FCA hourly and salaried workers are expected to begin their vote on whether to ratify the contract Dec. 6 in a process that usually takes about two weeks, the Detroit Free Press reported Saturday.

Workers are expected to ratify the contract, though the vote could be complicated by allegations of corruption that have roiled the union in recent weeks. This month two UAW officials -- a former UAW president and a regional director -- resigned after being implicated in a massive corruption scheme in which they were accused of submitting misleading expense reports.

Shivering and blue-lipped but smiling, Niraj Shukla emerged from the Ganges
River this week, flanked by his parents and millions of other people, feeling
renewed.

""The water is very cold, but once you have a bath – it's sort of a miracle,
you know?"" said Shukla, a 32-year-old engineer who lives in India's capital
New Delhi.

The Shukla family were among the first of what's expected to be 150 million
pilgrims all taking a dip in India's holy river through March 4 as part of the
[Kumbh Mela](https://kumbh.gov.in/), a Hindu religious festival billed as the
world's largest gathering of human beings at one event.

It happens every 12 years, its dates fixed according to the alignment of the
stars and planets. This year is a half-Kumbh – six years since the last one –
but it's nevertheless expected to be the biggest so far. The government
officials and religious authorities who organize the event estimate that 15
million people showed up on Tuesday, the opening day.

For the 2019 event, some 200 miles of new roads were built to ferry pilgrims
from all corners of India. They also come by train, or by boat down the
Ganges, carrying their belongings in bundles balanced on their heads. Pilgrims
sleep in a vast tent city at the river's edge, where temperatures slide toward
freezing at night.

Rich and poor, tourists and ascetic monks, all squat side by side, chanting
mantras.

They include naked dreadlocked holy men, Hindu priests draped in orange
sarongs and garlands of marigolds, families with infants, foreign backpackers
on spiritual journeys – and Shukla and his parents, who hail from the host
city, Allahabad.

Shukla returns home whenever his hometown hosts the Kumbh. This is his third.

The bathing spot is at the confluence of three rivers: the Ganges, the Yamuna
– two of India's biggest rivers – and the Saraswati, a mythical river which
the faithful believe flows underground. A dip in the waters is said to be
restorative, with the power to cleanse sin.

""You have work, you have tensions, you've committed some wrongdoings – you
know these things deep down inside. Now you come over here, you take a dip,
you feel that, 'I am in the company of some holy people – some saints,'""
Shukla explains. ""And then you step inside this holy water, and you feel
inside that you have cleansed yourself.""

Some people even drink the water, believing it to be curative, though
scientists caution them not to. The Ganges and Yamuna rivers are [already
polluted](https://www.npr.org/2016/05/11/477415686/can-indias-sacred-but-dead-

There have been fires and [stampedes](https://www.ucanews.com/news/more-
than-30-die-in-kumbh-mela-stampede/67383) in past years. But repeat visitors
say this year's Kumbh appears orderly so far. Organizers say 30,000 police and
security forces are on hand – plus 122,000 portable toilets and 20,000 trash
cans. The budget of nearly $600 million – the most expensive Kumbh ever – is
split between the state government of Uttar Pradesh and India's central
government, both of which are currently governed by Hindu nationalists.

Four Indian cities rotate in hosting the Kumbh. They are all said to be
located where Hindu lore says the gods accidentally dribbled holy nectar, or
elixir, down from the heavens. Kumbh means ""pot,"" a reference to the vessel
holding the elixir; Mela means ""fair"" or ""festival.""

""There was a tussle between the devil and the gods. Some drops of elixir –
amrit, we call it in Hindi – dropped at four places in India: Allahabad,
Nashik, Ujjain and Haridwar,"" explains Gitanjali Verma, 28, another local who
was attending her first Kumbh.

""It was a magical experience,"" she said after watching the first batch of
Hindu holy men dunk in the river at sunrise. ""It's just the faith, and the
total purity of the heart and mind, which bring people here."" ****

The crowd also includes foreign tourists.

""I'm an atheist, but because of this it's changing my point of view a little
bit,"" says Spaniard Santiago Merodio, 42, who tacked a trip to the Kumbh onto
the end of his India vacation, after attending a yoga retreat. ""I'm searching
for something [spiritually].""

This is the first year the city of Allahabad is hosting the Kumbh under its
new name – Prayagraj. Hindu nationalists who govern Uttar Pradesh last year
officially [renamed the city](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/india-
bjp-muslim-allahabad-prayagraj-181016165504687.html) to refer to an area of
land at the confluence of the rivers where Kumbh takes place. The new name
carries more significance to India's majority Hindus than the name Allahabad,
which had been coined by a Muslim king during the centuries when northern
India was ruled by the Mughals.

Another new twist to this year's Kumbh: huge billboards of Prime Minister
Narendra Modi, who's running for re-election this spring. Many of these
pilgrims are part of his Hindu nationalist voter base.

""We have to give credit to the ruling party, [Modi's BJP]. The elections are
coming. If that means they install more toilets and organize this Kumbh in a
more orderly way, that's great,"" Shukla says.

After their dip in the Ganges, he and his parents buy some grain and donate it
to a Hindu monk who blesses them, chants a mantra and smears a fragrant paste
called _tilak_ on their foreheads as part of a Hindu ritual.

""I was shivering and trembling, but the moment I stepped into the water, I was
just good,"" Shukla says. ""Now I am going back to my home as a new person.""

159359,eveningstandard,"The mother of a student who was shot and stabbed to death at random by roving gang members said she will “never be free from pain” as she saw her son’s killers jailed.

Russell Jordan Jones, 23, was standing on a street corner talking to friends when he was ambushed by four masked men brandishing knives and a 12-bore shotgun.

Mr Jones fled for his life but stumbled and was shot and then stabbed 12 times in a “merciless” attack. One of his friends was also knifed in the back but survived.

On Friday Judge Mark Dennis QC jailed two of the killers, Bilkan Bilkaner, 20, and Duke Quainoo, 21, for life and ordered that they both serve at least 29 years behind bars.

He said Mr Jones and his friends were not associated with gangs and had been “picked on at random” by the killers who wrongly believed they were rivals simply because they were standing together on a street corner.

At the sentencing hearing Mr Jones’s mother, Stephanie Saunders, said she believes unanswered questions about her son’s murder will “haunt me forever”.

“I would give my life in a heartbeat for Russell to have his back. Every day is pure torture”, she told the Old Bailey. “This is just the beginning of a life-long sentence, I will never be free from the pain and grief.”

She told the court her son was months away from completing a business management degree at the University of Hertfordshire and it was awarded posthumously following his murder.

Mr Jones had been out for dinner with friends on March 16 last year and was in South Street in Edmonton just after midnight when he was attacked.

Bilkaner, Quainoo, and two other men — who have not been caught — had spent an hour driving around the area looking for potential targets.

Judge Dennis said: “This was a shocking and brutal attack without a motive beyond the desire to cause death and serious injury to others.”

Bilkaner, from Edmonton, and Quainoo, from Enfield, both denied but were convicted at trial of murder, causing grievous bodily harm with intent and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life.

When the jury returned its verdicts last month and cleared a co-defendant of the attack, Bilkaner and Quainoo violently attacked the third man in the dock.

996016,thetelegraph,"Schools with debating clubs or cadets are to be rewarded under the new inspection regime, as Ofsted seeks to help build resilience in young people.

Under the new draft framework, published today, inspectors will mark schools on how much they help children “develop their character” which includes their resilience, confidence and independence.

Ofsted is proposing to have a stand-alone category for “personal development” for the first time, as a way to encourage schools to prioritise extra-curricular activities.

This could include debating or public speaking societies, cadet forces, Duke of Edinburgh, or extra music or drama clubs.

Amanda Spielman, the chief inspector, said the move is intended to emphasise to headteachers that building resilience in young people is an integral part of education.

“It’s about making clear that education is not just about teaching a good set of academic subjects really well,” she said. “There is something a bit intangible and bigger than that, and it is making sure they recognise that.”

Ms Spielman said that inspectors would not reward schools for putting on any one particular extra-curricular activity, but rather they would look at the range of pursuits on offer.

“It's not about any one thing, it’s about having a range of opportunities so people can discover their talents and interests,” she said. “A good school or college has that range of activities, so that everybody can discover what they are good at.”","Schools with debating clubs or cadets to be rewarded to help build childrens' resilience, Ofsted chief says",education,school,226
232672,greenwichtime,"After a report went viral in September that North America has lost nearly 2 million birds, new data released Thursday from the society finds that these numbers will only increase if no action is taken to reduce the human activity impacting climate change.

The effects of climate change threaten extinction for hundreds of birds in North America, according to the study, “Survival by Degrees: 389 Bird Species on the Brink.”

But if people and policy makers take steps to mitigate the effects of climate change to keep down global temperatures, about 76 percent of these at-risk birds could be saved, the report states.

“The lack of bird song in the 1950s alerted us to the dangers of the pesticide DDT,” Corrie Folsom-O’Keefe, director of bird conservation for Audubon Connecticut said. “Now birds are forewarning us of the impacts of climate change, from increased storm frequency and intensity to sea level rise.”

Bringing together 140 million observations from bird-lovers and biologists over the last five years, Audubon scientists studied 604 North American bird species and how their habitat range would change geographically based on different warming patterns. Birds were determined vulnerable if the amount of habitat they would lose, due to rising sea levels, deforestation, urbanization, heavy rains and/or increased fires, would be greater than the habitat they would gain by flying and settling elsewhere.

Audubon also launched a zip code-based Audubon’s Birds and Climate Visualizer, which people can use to see how the birds in their area could be impacted.

“Audubon’s new report emphasizes that climate change is local, it is personal, and it will require visionary and fast-moving action to achieve a more favorable future for birds and people,” Tavares said.

The scientists behind “Survival by Degrees” based their calculations on three models put forth by the 2014 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, for 1.5, 2 and 3 degrees Celsius of global warming. An increase of 1.5 degrees represents action taken to reduce the warming, while 3 degrees represents a conservative estimate of how much the Earth would warm if no action is taken, said Ana Paula Tavares, executive director of Audubon Connecticut.

In Connecticut specifically, species that are most threatened by a combination of climate change and climate-related threats under 3 degrees C of warming include the Brown Thrasher, Eastern Towhee, Scarlet Tanager, Wood Thrush and Saltmarsh Sparrow. Seventy-one species total are climate-vulnerable in summer under this scenario.

At the highest warming scenario of 3 degrees C, 305 bird species face three or more climate-related impacts.

In 2014, Audubon published its first Birds and Climate Change Report. The study showed that more than half of the bird species in North America could lose at least half of their current ranges by 2080 due to rising temperatures. Audubon’s new findings are more expanded, and more precise: Where the closest users could zoom in on the first interactive impact map was to 10 square kilometers, users can now drill down to one square kilometer — literally down to people’s neighborhoods and backyards, Tavares said.

With Audubon New York, Audubon Connecticut is working to conserve 200,000 acres of northeastern forest, 5,000 acres of salt marsh and 5,000 acres of beach and island habitat, Tavares said.

“We invite everyone to join us in this effort,” she said. “We need conservation champions to act and inspire to others to act now and act boldly. There is great hope for the future if we act now.”

Conserving forested land will help sequester carbon emissions, control flooding and protect watersheds, she said.

In Connecticut, the society is training foresters in bird-friendly forest management, so they can work with private landowners, who own the large majority of the state’s forested areas, Folsom-O’Keefe said.

To scale this effort up, the society is working on training and endorsing foresters so that they can engage larger audiences than the society’s staff could do alone, she said.

Additionally, the society is developing a forest-bird certification program that will work with large organizations, Folsom-O’Keefe said. Landowners and organizations can apply to be certified for having bird-friendly practices that meet certain requirements for being beneficial to birds and their habitats.

Audubon Connecticut also is urging state lawmakers to developing legislation to support coastal communities, which will be the first to feel the impacts of climate change, and to support the development of wind and solar energy sources.",Audubon study: Climate change to destabilize hundreds of bird populations,environment,climate change,708
20729,bbc,"Politicians in Washington have had a lot to say about the merits or otherwise of a border wall thousands of miles away. But why are so many lawmakers based there against it?

There are nine members of the House of Representatives whose districts lie along the US-Mexico border.

It is perhaps not surprising that the eight Democrats oppose President Donald Trump's signature campaign pledge.

But the one Republican congressman - whose district stretches for 820 miles (1,320km) along the border - is also hostile.

Most of his party, including some senators and governors of states at the border, back the president.

These nine House representatives have intimate knowledge of the border and the issues arising from the movement of people - legal or otherwise - across it.

So what have they said?

""I think building a concrete structure sea to shining sea is the most expensive and least effective way to do border security,"" said Will Hurd, a Republican congressman whose district has the longest border with Mexico.

Congressman Hurd's 23rd Congressional District, which stretches from El Paso to San Antonio, shares the largest border with Mexico of any member of Congress.

Mr Hurd, a former CIA agent who happens to be the only black Republican in the House of Representatives, has argued for a ""smart border wall"" which would be composed of sensors and other technology.

""A Smart Wall would use sensor, radar and surveillance technologies to detect and track incursions across our border so we can deploy efficiently our most important resource, the men and women of Border Patrol, to perform the most difficult task - interdiction,"" he wrote in an op-ed in 2017.

Mr Hurd, who broke rank with Republicans to vote on a Democratic-led bill to reopen government, said after Mr Trump's speech on Tuesday: ""If this is a crisis, the people that are dealing with this crisis should get paid.""

Federal workers who are deemed ""essential"" such as border patrol agents, have been forced to work without pay as the shutdown continues.

""It's a 4th Century solution to a 21st Century problem,"" said Congressman Vicente Gonzalez, whose district includes the border town of McAllen, which Trump plans to visit during the funding impasse.

""Nobody wants stronger border control than me,"" he told CBS.

But he opposes adding to the existing border wall because he does not ""think it brings real border security and it comes at a major cost to taxpayers"".

Congressman Henry Cuellar, who represents Texas' 8th congressional district, believes $4bn is needed to modernise ports of entry, not for a wall which he says would only delay migrants by ""a few minutes or a few seconds"".

He adds that modern telecommunications for border agents, and funding to help Mexico secure its own southern border, would also be helpful.

The new Arizona congresswoman took office in early January as the representative for Arizona's 2nd District and has pledged not to vote for border wall funding.

""We don't want a wall in southern Arizona. A third of our economy comes from Mexico. We want to build bridges not walls,"" she told Arizona Public Media as she was sworn in.

Mr Grijalva has been a vocal critic of Mr Trump's proposal.

""Not a single cent should go to funding Trump's monument to hate,"" he tweeted after Mr Trump addressed the nation on primetime TV to argue that there is a ""crisis"" at the border.

""This is a terrible, terrible mistake that Trump is making,"" he told CBS, calling it ""a fantasy"" and ""not a solution"".

""It would be devastating to my district,"" said Mr Grijalva, whose own father came emigrated from Mexico in the 1940s.

In her first act as a newly elected member of Congress, Veronica Escobar of Texas' 16th District chose to cast her vote for ""Nancy 'no wall' Pelosi"" - the Democratic House leader who has opposed budgeting for Mr Trump's wall.

""Donald Trump is trying to portray border communities as these open, lawless areas where a wall will solve problems,"" she said in a Twitter video for MoveOn.org, a Democratic advocacy group.

Mrs Escobar, who represents the border city of El Paso, blamed Republicans for wrongly and ""needless fear mongering about communities like mine"".

Congressman Juan Vargas, who has represented California's 51st District for the last five years, said there is no crisis where he lives along the border.

""I live along the border, about a little over 10 miles from the border. It's San Diego. I mean, it's basically paradise,"" he told CNN. ""The notion that we have a crisis there, security crisis, is absolute nonsense.""

""The reality is, yes, there are people sneaking into our country,"" Mr Vargas said. ""We can stop that if we have smart solutions, and that's only going to be reliant on technology.""

New Mexico's newly elected Congresswoman Xochitl Torres Small visited the border earlier this week with other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.

While visiting a Border Patrol station where a Guatemalan migrant child died on Christmas Eve, she called for first responders along remote and rural areas of the border to carry emergency medical equipment.

""The border is my home, and I am committed to fighting for and implementing policies which will help to make it #strong #smart and #fair,"" she tweeted after the visit.

Texas Congressman Filemon Vela Jr has said in the past that he agrees with President Trump on trying to tackle the Mexican drug cartels and deporting criminals.

But he is deeply opposed to the wall.

In a scathing open letter to candidate Trump in 2016, he said: ""Why any modern-thinking person would ever believe that building a wall along the border of a neighbouring country, which is both our ally and one of our largest trading partners, is frankly astounding and asinine.""

been an outspoken critic of Mr Trump's immigration policies, and criticised his decision before the mid-term elections in November to deploy troops to the border, which he said ""inspired white national vigilantes"" to flood the region.

76506,breitbart,"Parents and church leaders in Worcester, Massachusetts, joined with Massachusetts Family Institute (MFI) to defeat a Planned Parenthood-implemented sex-ed curriculum in public schools.

In a column at the Daily Signal, Michael King, MFI director of community alliances, referred to the joint efforts of his organization, parents, and church leaders as a “sex ed showdown” with Planned Parenthood and its supporters.

He told Breitbart News in a phone interview that the Worcester school board committee ultimately voted down the curriculum because of the outreach of both parents and church leaders who outnumbered supporters of Planned Parenthood.

King explained MFI has reached out to about 125 different churches across the state throughout the past three years.

He testified before the school board committee after reviewing the “Making Proud Choices” sex-ed curriculum materials, asserting that “abstinence” has been “redefined” in one of the program’s workshops to include:

“The only reason I read that is because that is how we are defining abstinence today,” King continued in his testimony. “And I think a lot of people in this room would have a different definition of abstinence.”

Making a reference to the common criticism by Planned Parenthood and its allies that studies show abstinence education does not work with teens, King said, “If studies show that abstinence doesn’t work, maybe it’s because they’ve redefined it and they’re not really looking at the real definition.”

“So, I want you to think about that, and think about what are we teaching our kids, that we are over-sexualizing our kids, and is this really age-appropriate?” he asserted.

Planned Parenthood says about the curriculum:

King told Breitbart News the decision by the school board committee to shelve Making Proud Choices was “a huge victory.”

“We had about 75 people, many from the Hispanic community,” he said, who joined with his organization.

Mary Ellen Siegler, MFI consultant on comprehensive sex education, told Breitbart News the fact that many parents are not aware of what is being taught in their children’s schools is “alarming.”

She said parents have shown her emails of responses by school officials to requests for details about the proposed sex-ed program, but those responses are often cursory or evasive.

“They’re being sent back this information that, honestly, if you are not educated on the issues or haven’t done the deep research, it looks like what they’re being presented is totally fine,” Siegler explained.

King said MFI is working in other towns and cities across the Bay State “to encourage parents to go to their school principal, or whoever teaches sex ed, and request exactly what is being taught to their children, especially in middle school and high school.”",‘Sex Ed Showdown’: Parents Defeat Planned Parenthood in Blue Massachusetts,education,parent organisation,427

The fantasy drama debuted on BBC One last night to a huge 7.2 million viewers but not everyone was impressed by the way Philip Pullman's beloved trilogy was brought to life.

The first episode introduced us to 12-year Lyra (Dafne Keen) who was raised at an Oxford University college after her uncle Lord Asriel (James McAvoy) left her there as a baby to keep her safe.

We were also introduced to the daemons, the spirit animals who house the humans' souls and follow them everywhere.

But the complex plot and dense mythology of the other-worldly adventure left many scratching their heads and turning off.

One wrote: ""#HisDarkMaterials nope, gave it a try but, not being familiar with the books, found it slow, dull and rather impenetrable (found myself playing on my phone). Have the BBC spent a fortune on something just for existing fans?""

A second added: ""Surely I can’t be the only one who is completely, and utterly confused?""

A third weighed in: ""I was not convinced. Was a bit all over the place but maybe just because it was setting the scene hopefully next week will be better I know the story is good.""

A fourth gave their verdict: ""Hmm, not sure about #HisDarkMaterials yet.

639370,thedailymirror,"An animal welfare charity has shut down what appeared to be a dog meat farm that butchered family pets.

Pictures show how dogs would be held in holding pens before being butchered with some even turned into bar snacks.

The Cambodian slaughterhouse was processing between 2,000 and 5,000 dogs a year, according to animal welfare charity Four Paws.

Dr Katherine Polak, a veterinarian at Four Paws, first heard about the slaughterhouse from local restaurants who used it as a supplier.

The first thing she saw at the rural property in the Takeo province, just outside of Phnom Penh, was a dying tree with caged dogs underneath.

She told Yahoo News : “The tree was apparently in full bloom about a year ago, but it’s just been dying from all the blood and urine and faeces.

“There’s a smell, there’s a stench to it, it’s really heartbreaking.”

“The farmer would hit them over the head and then put their back legs into the cage,” she said.

“So the other dogs would watching this, waiting for their turn.

“And then he stabs them in the throat, allows them to bleed out a bit and then he puts them in a pot of boiling water.”

Selling dogs for meat often attracts a social stigma in south east Asia and Dr Polak has heard stories of the farmers being beaten to death by villagers in neighbouring Vietnam.

The farmer at the Takeo province facility contacted Four Paws, pleading them to help him get out of the trade.

On October 27, Four Paws and Animal Rescue Cambodia entered the property and seized the surviving 10 dogs.

These included two animals the farmer had kept since they were puppies as good luck charms.

The damaged canines had been confined to cages.

Working to shut down the farm, Four Paws purchased a rice paddy for the farmer as an alternative income source and he has now pledged never to enter the dog meat trade again.

While the trade is largely conducted underground and numbers hard to estimate, Dr Polak believes annual dog slaughter numbers amount to five million in Vietnam, three million in Cambodia and one million in Indonesia.","Inside horrific dog meat farm where 5,000 family pets butchered",human interest,animal,346
33647,bbc,"Russia has become the master of denial in recent years. From military incursions to hacking to assassinations, the Kremlin has sworn blind it's not involved.

But now the country's athletes are waiting nervously, facing sweeping sanctions for another doping-linked scandal, and senior officials are keeping their silence.

There is one, striking exception.

Yuri Ganus has been warning for months that Russian sport stands on a ""cliff-edge"" and needs to radically clean up its act. For that, the head of Russia's anti-doping agency, Rusada, says he has received pressure and threats.

""Threats or not, clean sport is my mission,"" Mr Ganus told the BBC, in offices whose corridors are hung with messages of encouragement for a reformed Rusada from other anti-doping bodies around the world.

The Rusada boss is sure the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) executive committee will ban Russian athletes from global competition on Monday for four years, including next year's Olympics. He argues that is Russia's own fault.

The story goes back to the 2014 Sochi games, a prestige project for President Vladimir Putin that was meant to project Russian skill, strength and superiority to the world.

The nation's athletes bagged medals and glory across the board. But two years later Russia's reputation was in tatters when a scientist-turned-whistleblower revealed a massive, state-backed doping programme.

Returning to the sporting fold depended on Moscow proving it had turning a new page. That included handing over a key database of athletes' test results.

But Yuri Ganus confirms that someone altered or deleted ""thousands"" of entries first.

""When I opened the documents [from Wada], I was in real stress. I saw huge changes,"" he says. ""It's a real tragedy for our sport.""

The ""tragedy"" is that this apparently crude attempt at a cover-up will hurt a generation of Russian athletes, barred from the competitions they've spent their lives preparing for.

Anna Sidorova, who's won multiple medals curling for her country, is trying to blot out thoughts of a blanket ban.

""I'm still training and just trying to focus on this, because that an area I can control,"" she says as other curlers glide by, one knee bent, on the ice behind her.

""I'm not thinking about the other stuff.""

So pro-Kremlin TV channels have been working to channel public anger.

One chat show claimed Wada's accusations were invented by Europeans to eliminate a powerful sporting rival. A documentary claimed the original whistleblower was responsible, accessing the electronic database remotely from the US to alter it.

Some sports officials are also apparently in denial.

""Why I should I believe Wada and not our own people here in Russia?"" Yelena Vyalbe, the head of the cross-country ski federation, wants to know.

The former Olympic champion's office is stuffed with trophies and decorated with an image of Vladimir Putin on horseback.

""This anti-Russian hysteria is a multi-part series we've all seen before,"" she says. ""Even [1990s soap-opera] Santa Barbara was more interesting than this show on Russia and doping.""

""Do they think we're total idiots?"" the skier asks.

Was it all down to stupidity?

That is part of the key question.

Were those who altered the database - and so dug Russia into an even deeper hole - incompetent, imagining they'd never be found out?

Or did they not care about the consequences?

Sergei Medvedev, of Moscow's Higher School of Economics, suspects the former.

""It was crystal clear this would be detected. It was such stupidity, so outrageous! It's like Monty Python stuff,"" he says, adding that the world had seen ""such a strain of idiocy"" before, with the 2018 poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal in the UK.

The two suspects then appeared on state TV with a ridiculously implausible cover story.

Mr Medvedev doesn't see the direct hand of the Kremlin in the latest doping scandal, though. He suggests it's more likely that influential people - possibly former athletes - wanted the data purged.

""I think someone tried to protect their reputation,"" Yuri Ganus agrees. ""Perhaps those who now work in high level authority structures, in sports. I don't know, exactly.

""This is a wrong and bad old school approach. We need to change.""

As athletes wait to learn their fate, the minister responsible for handing the files over to Wada remains tight-lipped.

A former champion fencer, Pavel Kolobkov was appointed to head the sports ministry in the post-Sochi era, part of Russia demonstrating its commitment to clean sport.

But he has not condemned the apparent cover-up, refusing to comment at all until Wada rules on any sanctions.

For Russia, though, all this runs deeper than sport: it's about how the country is run, its priorities - and how it behaves in a crisis. So far, the traditional techniques - deny, accuse, bluster - are all in play.

But the stakes are different.

Threatened with political isolation by the West, Moscow can shrug that off - pointing to other allies, other options.

In sport, a stage on which Russia loves to strut its stuff, there is no alternative to integration.

""In politics, you can play with a poker face, deny the undeniable - but not in sport,"" Sergei Medvedev argues. ""There are clear sanctions - and you can't do sport on your own.""

""Russia could hold a 'home' Olympics with Turkmenistan, Belarus and North Korea,"" he says. ""But everyone would laugh at that.""",Russia doping: Athletes wait in fear of fresh world ban,sport,drug use in sport,850
232196,globalresearch,"Despite the European Union attempts to save the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which saw Iran reduce its low-enriched uranium by 98% and eliminate its stockpile of medium-enriched uranium in return for economic relief, JCPOA is hanging by a thread because of Washington’s withdrawal from the deal in October 2017.

The European Statistical Office revealed that from January to September trade between the EU and Iran was at €3.86 billion, a massive 74.92% drop compared to the same period in 2018. The report revealed that Germany (€1.23 billion), Italy (€734.78 million) and the Netherlands (€376.73 million) were Iran’s top three trading partners in EU while trade with Greece (€32.08 million), Luxembourg (€506,316), Spain (€207.36 million), France (€296.5 million) and Austria (€102.11 million) had plunged by 97.13%, 91.38%, 91.17%, 86.79% and 82.38% respectively.

Although Iran’s trade with Cyprus at €6.25 million and Bulgaria at €64.97 million increased by 85.12% and 29.24% respectively year-on-year— the highest among EU states — it still does not offset the massive decline in trade with Greece, Luxembourg, Spain, France and Austria. The major decline in trade is attributed due to European companies’ unwillingness to risk losing business with the U.S. for the sake of the much smaller Iranian market. Effectively, U.S. President Donald Trump’s economic war with Iran is to diminish Iranian-EU trade so that for the U.S. may reap benefits from boosting its own oil and other commodities. However, this is set to change.

With this dramatic downturn in trade with the EU, Iran is now pushing to diversify its economy even further to overcome a reliance on oil and take a number of measures in an attempt to counter U.S. economic aggression, including increasing taxes, cutting energy subsidies and to borrow money from friendly states. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani explained on Sunday in parliament that oil revenues are expected to drop by at least 70% and that Iran’s budget next year “is designed to resist against sanctions and to announce to the world that we run this country despite sanctions.”

The Iranian president explained that the new budget will reach $115.3 billion because of the reduction of oil exportation from 2.8 million barrels of oil a day before Trump’s May sanctions to 500,000 barrels a day. In addition, Iran will sell more bonds in the domestic market and plans to increase revenues from taxes by 13%, but these changes come as the International Monetary Fund has already forecasted that the Islamic Republic will have a reduction of its economy of about 9.5% this year.

This “budget of resistance,” as described by Rouhani, is “contrary to what the Americans thought. With the pressure of sanctions, our country’s economy would encounter problems, thank God we have chosen the correct path… and we are moving forward.”

Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi announced on Monday that the European signatories to the JCPOA will not activate the “trigger mechanism” for the time being that could see the return of sanctions against the Islamic Republic. It is unlikely that the EU or Iran will withdraw from what remains of JCPOA as they attempt to bypass U.S. sanctions which can see the besieged country improve its economy through increased trade with Europe.

Not only has the EU pledged to maintain its nuclear deal commitments, in a joint statement late last month, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden said they will attain shares in Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX), that was launched by Britain, France and Germany in January to allow European companies to trade with Iran without using U.S. dollars so they could be protected from U.S. sanctions.

In their joint statement, they said:

This is also a part of a wider move to counter strong U.S. efforts to muscle in on the European oil market as U.S. sanctions have scared buyers from acquiring Iranian and Venezuelan crude. The so-called hydro-fracking and shale revolution that began a few years ago has seen the U.S. aggressively seek to export its oil to new markets. It is now unsurprising that earlier this year U.S. crude shipments to Europe reached new records, behind Russia but still more than Nigeria and Libya who are important OPEC members.

Therefore, a major reason for the false allegations by Trump that Iran was violating the JCPOA was to force Iran out of the European market to push on the U.S. entrance. It appears that Trump’s plan has failed. Not only has Iran formulated its “budget of resistance,” but with Belgium, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden becoming shareholders INSTEX, they are prepared to continue their economic relations with Iran while being protected from U.S. repercussions. Effectively, although the U.S. has achieved a short-term reduction in European-Iranian trade, it will not only recover, but also be strengthened as new mechanisms are being made to bypass U.S. banks and dollars.

68036,birminghammail,"The Apprentice is a heated show on TV, I think we can all agree - however it appears, what's said in the boardroom doesn't actually stay in the boardroom.

The candidates were tasked this week with rebranding Finland and Lewis Ellis whipped his top off for the advert revealing his tattoos - much to the dislike of Lord Alan Sugar.

As the episode was airing, the businessman was tweeting along and he slammed the digital marketer's body art.

Lord Sugar tweeted: ""Lewis tattoos are horrific. Tell me where I am missing the point. What does he look like.""

A few minutes later Lewis replied: ""Wowwww LAS how could you do me like this.""

However this led to the 29-year-old being on the receiving end of a barrage of abuse and trolling.

Later he posted an image of his tattoos writing: ""Back to rule #1 f**k what people think about you! Thank you everyone that took the time to show some support for my ""horrific"" tattoos and pointing out no one has the right to judge you or your body. #theapprentice #tattoos #inked #inkedlife.""

However that wasn't the end of the argument as the host of the BBC show hit back hours later, tweeting: ""Lewis your tattoos tell your story.What are you a Kindle. You have the right to do what you want to your body. I have the right of an opinion. I say they are horrible. When you're 50 on the beach you'll wear a T shirt. You will be an embarrassment to your kids.""

The phrase has gone viral over the last few weeks and is used to dismiss or mock attitudes stereotypically attributed to the baby boomer generation.

Lewis has tattoos on his chest and one of his arms, usually hidden for business purposes under a suit and tie and a MailOnline source revealed that he was actually encouraged to go shirtless, despite not particularly wanting to.

The source said: ""One of the female candidates wasn't happy to get into a bikini for the scenes so Lewis felt forced to do it. Which isn't fair. If she wasn't body confident it doesn't automatically mean everyone else is.

""Lewis had hidden his tattoos up until that point but this task meant he had to show them. And because of Lord Sugar's old-fashioned views, he has commented on Twitter and opened the floor to all the trolls to attack Lewis. It's not right!""

Lewis has said inkings are ""an expression of himself"" and ""are a personal reminder, when I take a shower and g to the gym, to just keep going"".

The tattoos on his chest - of a man walking between two paths, a ferris wheel on one side, cogs on the other - represent ""never conforming, not being the same as everyone else, and never being part of a machine"".

His arm inkings represent ""hope and faith"" and that ""things don't always happen straight away, but you’ll get there eventually"".

Lewis has admitted that ""they're cheesy, but I love them"".

215174,france24,"European Southern Observatory/AFP | A handout photo provided by the European Southern Observatory on April 10 shows the first photograph of a black hole and its fiery halo released by Event Horizon Telescope astronomers.

Astronomers on Wednesday unveiled the first photo of a black hole, one of the star-devouring monsters scattered throughout the Universe and obscured by impenetrable shields of gravity.

The image of a dark core encircled by a flame-orange halo of white-hot gas and plasma looks like any number of artists' renderings over the last 30 years.

But this time, it's the real deal.

Scientists have been puzzling over invisible ""dark stars"" since the 18th century, but never has one been spied by a telescope, much less photographed.

The supermassive black hole now immortalised by a far-flung network of radio telescopes is 50 million lightyears away in a galaxy known as M87.

""It's a distance that we could have barely imagined,"" Frederic Gueth, an astronomer at France's National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and co-author of studies detailing the findings, told AFP.

Most speculation had centred on the other candidate targeted by the Event Horizon Telescope -- Sagittarius A*, the black hole at the centre of our own galaxy, the Milky Way.

By comparison, Sag A* is only 26,000 lightyears from Earth.

Locking down an image of M87's supermassive black hole at such distance is comparable to photographing a pebble on the Moon.

It was also a team effort.

""Instead of constructing a giant telescope that would collapse under its own weight, we combined many observatories,"" Michael Bremer, an astronomer at the Institute for Millimetric Radio Astronomy (IRAM) in Grenoble, told AFP.

Over several days in April 2017, eight radio telescopes in Hawaii, Arizona, Spain, Mexico, Chile, and the South Pole zeroed in on Sag A* and M87.

Knit together ""like fragments of a giant mirror,"" in Bremer's words, they formed a virtual observatory some 12,000 kilometres across -- roughly the diameter of Earth.

In the end, M87 was more photogenic. Like a fidgety child, Sag A* was too ""active"" to capture a clear picture, the researchers said.

""The telescope is not looking at the black hole per se, but the material it has captured,"" a luminous disk of white-hot gas and plasma known as an accretion disk, said McNamara, who was not part of the team.

""The light from behind the black hole gets bent like a lens.""

The unprecedented image -- so often imagined in science and science fiction -- has been analysed in six studies co-authored by 200 experts from 60-odd institutions and published Wednesday in Astrophysical Journal Letters.

""I never thought that I would see a real one in my lifetime,"" said CNRS astrophysicist Jean-Pierre Luminet, author in 1979 of the first digital simulation of a black hole.

Coined in the mid-60s by American physicist John Archibald Wheeler, the term ""black hole"" refers to a point in space where matter is so compressed as to create a gravity field from which even light cannot escape.

The more mass, the bigger the hole.

At the same scale of compression, Earth would fit inside a thimble. The Sun would measure a mere six kilometres edge-to-edge.

A successful outcome depended in part on the vagaries of weather during the April 2017 observation period.

""For everything to work, we needed to have clear visibility at every [telescope] location worldwide"", said IRAM scientist Pablo Torne, recalling collective tension, fatigue and, finally, relief.

Torne was at the controls of the Pico Veleta telescope in Spain's Sierra Madre mountains.

After that, is was eight months of nail-biting while scientists at MIT Haystack Observatory in Massachusetts and the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn crunched the data.

The Universe is filled with electromagnetic ""noise"", and there was no guarantee M87's faint signals could be extracted from a mountain of data so voluminous it could not be delivered via the Internet.

There was at least one glitch.

""We were desperately waiting for the data from the South Pole Telescope, which -- due to extreme weather conditions during the southern hemisphere winter -- didn't arrive until six months later,"" recalled Helger Rottmann from the Max Planck Institute.

It arrived, to be precise, on December 23, 2017.

""When, a few hours later, we saw that everything was there, it was one hell of a Christmas present,"" Rottmann said.

It would take another year, however, to piece together the data into an image.

""To be absolutely sure, we did the work four times with four different teams,"" said Gueth.

Each team came up with exactly the same spectacular, history-making picture of a dark circle encased in a flaming-red halo.",Astronomers unveil the first-ever photo of a black hole,science and technology,natural science,742
62340,birminghammail,"A convicted killer threatened to attack and rape a woman about a month before he murdered a ""beautiful"" Vietnamese mother-of-two, an inquest has heard.

Nail technician Quyen Ngoc Nguyen was murdered by Stephen Unwin and William McFall on August 15 2017 before being dumped in her own car and set alight on Shiney Row, near Sunderland.

The pair, who were convicted of the 28-year-old's murder and sentenced to full-life terms in April last year, had previously committed separate murders and met while in prison for those offences.

They met Ms Ngoc Nguyen while working as handymen on several flats she was renting out, their trial at Newcastle Crown Court heard.

An inquest into her death started on Tuesday at Sunderland Coroners' Court after coroner Derek Winter decided it was necessary to look into whether the police and probation service missed opportunities to prevent the murder.

For the latest on trials and court cases from across Birmingham and the West Midlands, join BirminghamLive's Court Facebook group .

The court heard that Unwin, of Houghton-le-Spring, Sunderland, was released from jail on licence on December 20 2012, with Northumbria Police receiving 26 ""items of intelligence"" between his release date and the murder of Ms Ngoc Nguyen.

Detective Inspector Edward Small told the court one of those items related to a complaint from a woman that, on July 2 2017, Unwin had sent her a Facebook audio message threatening to ""smash her jaw in"" and take turns with another man to rape her.

The court heard that the complainant in that incident had mentioned to officers over the phone that Unwin had served prison time for murder.

The officer who looked into the complainant's report the following day, Pc Sarah Strong, told the inquest she ""can't remember"" whether she was aware the alleged offender was a convicted murderer at the time.

Pc Strong said it was probable that she would have only briefly read the force's report on Unwin before speaking with the complainant on July 3 2017, due to the time pressure caused by having to investigate numerous cases on a day-to-day basis.

She told the inquest the alleged victim had not taken the complaint any further, and the investigation effectively ended then.

Asked whether an alleged threat from a convicted murderer should have prompted more action, Pc Strong said: ""Unfortunately these types of threats are not uncommon and are the kind of things that people do say on Facebook.""

Mr Small said a change in how the force logged ""flags"", meaning relevant intelligence, regarding prisoners out on licence would have meant that incidents like Unwin's alleged threat were not automatically passed to probation services.

From 2013 the force operated a system where flags on an on-licence offender's record would be passed to probation officers through the force's Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (Mappa).

But he said that, in a bid to reduce workload, from April 24 2015 warnings about an offender's behaviour would have to be reported to probation officers through a police officer at their own discretion.

Mr Small said that, in December last year, Northumbria Police introduced a system whereby flags against an offender would be passed to a ""multi-agency safeguarding hub"", as well as to probation services through the investigating officer.

Detective Chief Inspector Lisa Laverick told the inquest that, despite the change in 2015, a message on Unwin's report incorrectly said that flags would be passed on to probation through Mappa.

Discussing the scope of the inquest, which is expected to last nine days, the coroner said he will consider whether the killers' levels of risk were properly assessed.

He said witnesses will also be questioned on whether information relevant to a ""potential recall"" of the men before Ms Ngoc Nguyen's death was brought to the attention of the relevant parties.",Convicted killer 'threatened to rape woman before murdering nail technician mum-of-two',"crime, law and justice",crime,613

A yellow weather alert warning of ice remains in place until 11am today, which covers the entire region as well as Cheshire, Lancashire and Merseyside.

Overnight temperatures plunged to around -2C to -3C, bringing further wintry showers and causing ice to form on road surfaces.

It means driving to work during the morning commute could be tricky, with drivers advised to allow extra time for journeys.

The Snake Pass remains shut today due to dangerous conditions and snow on the route between Ladybower Reservoir and Hurst Road.

There are also issues with poor visibility at Manchester Airport caused by the fog.

At least one Flybe flight travelling to Paris Charles de Gaulle from Manchester Airport has been cancelled today, while other flights have been delayed while de-icing of the plane takes place.

Despite the bitter conditions forecasters have said there will not be as much snow today compared to on Tuesday.

There could be a few wintry showers over the hills and across the Pennines, but for most of the day there will be periods of bright sunshine in the region.

This evening it will remain dry, with temperatures dipping again to below freezing with lows of around -1C to -2C.

A band of rain is expected to arrive in the North West in the early hours of Thursday morning, which could turn into sleet or snow across the hills.

The Met Office said there could even be a bit of snowfall at lower levels in the early hours of the morning.

This is expected to clear in time for the Thursday morning commute, but there is a chance another ice warning will be issued due to icy patches forming again on the roads.

Temperatures are expected to increase to around 5C to 6C during the day on Thursday.

By Friday it will feel much warmer, with highs of around 9C to 10C expected. It will be a cloudy day, with some patches of rain but condition will be less bitter compared to recent days.

Steven Keats, meteorologist for the Met Office said: ""Today it is looking like a bit of a better day than yesterday. There will still be wintry showers around over the Pennines, but there will be a lot more sunshine than yesterday.

""It is pretty cold this morning. Temperatures are around -2C at the moment and there will be fog around, but that should clear and there will be some bright sunshine. Top temperatures today will be around 2C-3C.

""Wrap up warm, but some sunshine should prevail.

""Tonight it will start off dry with clear skies in the early hours, but a band of showers are coming in from the North.

""It will bring sleet and snow, mainly over the hills but don't rule out seeing some snow lower down. There is a greater risk of precipitation on some surfaces which will freeze, causing an ice risk. Temperatures overnight will be around -1C to -2C.

""And then tomorrow there will be showers and cloud. A warmer front is coming across Ireland into North West England in the evening. There will be outbreaks of drizzle and rain. It will turn increasingly cloudy. Temperatures will be about 5C to 6C.

The national medical director will say NHS trusts across the country must centralise services, so that victims get the right help sooner.

Professor Stephen Powis will say hospitals should follow a controversial model pioneered in London and Manchester, which is now saving around 170 lives a year.

In both cities, local stroke wards were closed, with ambulances instead taking victims not to nearest hospital, but to larger centres with access to brain scans, clot-busting drugs and specialist procedures.

As a result, the numbers dying or suffering long-term disability have fallen significantly.

Now health chiefs want to introduce the same changes across towns and cities in England, in the hope of saving more than 800 lives a year.

Professor Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said rolling out expert stroke teams will ensure thousands more people “survive and thrive”.

Speaking at the NHS Confederation conference in Manchester, he will say: “Introducing quicker access to better treatment for stroke in London and here in Manchester has saved hundreds of lives and we now want to see them rolled out across the whole of the country.

75130,breitbart,"An Australian woman with 200 tattoos said she went blind for three weeks after having her eyeballs inked.

Amber Luke, 24, who refers to herself as Blue Eyes White Dragon, said the procedure was extremely painful.

“I can’t even begin to describe to you what the feeling was like. The best thing I can give you is once the eyeball was penetrated with the ink, it felt like [the tattoo artist] grabbed ten shards of glass and rubbed it in my eye,” she recalled.

Luke said the artist shoved the needle too deep into her sclera, the white outer layer of the eyeball, causing her to go blind.

“That was pretty brutal,” she said.

However, the young woman has no regrets about her decision to have her eyes colored or any of the other tattoos that cover her body.

Luke began to modify herself when she was 16 and has since spent more than $37,000 on procedures that include breast augmentation, lip fillers, and having her earlobes stretched and her tongue split. She also got ear implants to make them look pointed and had silver fang grills made for her teeth.

Although she hopes to have her entire body tattooed by March 2020, Luke said, “I don’t plan on getting any more body modifications that are extreme in that manner. So no more tongue splitting, no more eyeball tattooing.”

However, her mother, Vikki, said she became emotional when her daughter told her she had inked her eyes blue.

“Why would you do that to yourself, knowing that there is a danger to it? As we know as the parents, some kids will just do what they want to do, regardless of what we say. But I brought her into the world with the best skills that I could give, the best that I could give her; it’s just for me to be there and go along the journey with her. And prop her up, and love her. She never saw herself as being beautiful. She didn’t see herself through my eyes. But I’ve supported her because I could actually see the transition, the growth and how it’s made her come to who she is today.”

Doctors diagnosed Luke with severe clinical depression when she was 15. She called the experience of getting her first tattoo a “negative energy release.”

“Everyone has their own opinion. Everyone knows what beauty is in their own eyes,” she said, adding that she hopes for “a bit more open-mindedness when it comes to body modification … in the community and within the workplace.”",VIDEO: Woman Covered in Tattoos Says She Went Blind After Having Eyes Inked Blue,lifestyle and leisure,lifestyle,417

71427,breitbart,"This week, half of the 24 Democrats running for their party’s presidential nomination confirmed that their healthcare plans would provide free health care to all illegal aliens at the expense of American taxpayers — including former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY).

Center for Immigration Studies Director of Research Steven Camarotta told Breitbart News that only rough estimates are available for what health care for illegal aliens will cost American taxpayers, and though a comprehensive study has yet to be conducted on this specific issue, taxpayers can expect to pay a “significant” amount.

“If we offered Medicaid for illegal immigrants, it is possible the costs could be over tens of billions of dollars,” Camarotta said. “However, it would depend on eligibility criteria as well as how many illegal immigrants actually sign up for program once it was offered. So while the actual costs are uncertain, the size would be significant for taxpayers.”

A reasonable estimate of health care for each illegal alien, Camarotta said, is about $3,000 — about half the average $6,600 that it currently costs annually for each Medicaid recipient. This assumes that a number of illegal aliens already have health insurance through employers and are afforded free health care today when they arrive to emergency rooms.

Based on this estimate, should the full 22 million illegal aliens be living in the U.S. that Yale University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers have estimated there to be, providing health care for the total illegal population could cost American taxpayers about $66 billion a year.

Over a decade, based on the Yale estimate of the illegal population and assuming all sign up for free health care, this would cost American taxpayers about $660 billion.

Even if there are only 11 million illegal aliens living in the U.S., as the Pew Research Center and other analysts routinely estimate, American taxpayers would still have to pay a yearly bill of $33 billion a year to provide them all with free, subsidized health care.

Should only half of the illegal population get health care, it would cost American taxpayers about $16.5 billion a year — almost the price of what it currently costs taxpayers to provide subsidized health care to illegal aliens.

Today, Americans are forced to subsidize about $18.5 billion worth of yearly medical costs for illegal aliens living in the U.S., according to estimates by Chris Conover, formerly of the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research at Duke University.

Nearly every Democrat running for their party’s presidential nomination has endorsed having American taxpayers pay for free health care for illegal aliens. Those who have endorsed the plan include Biden, Sanders, Gillibrand, Buttigieg, and Harris, along with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA), Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO), author Marianne Williamson, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA), entrepreneur Andrew Yang, and Gov. John Hickenlooper (D-CO).

A general election has been called for December 12, after the dissolution of Parliament.

The Conservatives gained their seat from Labour in the 2010 general election.

Prior to the Conservatives victory, Labour initially won the seat in 1997.

However, since 2010, the Conservatives have managed to steadily increase their votes.

Why are we having an early election?

A general election - which determines who runs the country - normally happens every five years.

There are 650 constituencies, where voters are invited to select an MP to represent their area.

Nearly three-and-a-half years ago voters were called to the ballot box to decide whether the UK should remain in or leave the European Union.

The majority chose to leave and we were supposed to have left on March, 29 this year, however, it has since been delayed after MPs failed to back plans put forward by former Prime Minister Theresa May and now Boris Johnson.

276645,ipolitics,"A new study suggests the provinces and Ottawa are enjoying a much improved relationship when it comes to developing labour market policy, as evidenced by new workplace development agreements and the establishment of Labour Market Information Council and Future Skills Centre.

The study, authored by Andrew McDougall and published by the Institute for Research on Public Policy, details how the once-acrimonious relationship, marked by jurisdictional squabbles and regional politics, has improved as it has shifted more toward developing pragmatic solutions.

“In the last couple of years, you’ve really seen both Ottawa and the provinces put some of that politics aside a little bit,” McDougall, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Toronto Scarborough, told iPolitics in an interview Tuesday.

“And now you see a much more collaborative relationship than you had previously, and one that’s really started to be more focused on solutions to the problems that those orders of government have identified rather than focusing on jurisdictional disputes,” he said.

The long-standing jurisdictional issues over labour market policy essentially boils down to Ottawa’s push for a national public employment service that helps match supply and demand clashing with the province’s exclusive constitutional responsibility for education, according to the study. The provincial governments have long maintained that their own training and skills development are more effective because they respond to regional and local conditions.

In particular, Quebec has argued for decades that the federal government should not be providing training programs.

Finally, in response to the nail-biter 1995 Quebec referendum and pressure from some other provinces, Ottawa began devolving leadership for training and skills programs, leading to a series of intergovernmental agreements governing the transfer of responsibility and funds to the provincial governments.

Ottawa, though, remained involved in programs for Indigenous people, youth and people with disabilities.

READ MORE: Liberals focus on skills, housing, students and seniors in pre-election budget

During this devolution period, the study points to the forum for federal, provincial and territorial labour market ministers for playing an important role in intergovernmental relations in this sector.

McDougall credited pressure from constituents favouring more amicable relationships between the various orders of government and a cooling of some of the regional political tensions for helping to improve intergovernmental relations on the file.

But he also said a big factor was the development of certain norms and expectations around co-operation that have crystallized during the devolution period.

For example, he said Quebec has long had an interest in the devolution of federal programs and, now that it has achieved that, the other provinces and Ottawa have accepted this arrangement, thus cooling the politics behind the push.

“Now there are certain norms that have developed in this field around collaboration, which hadn’t existed previously. And it becomes much more difficult for an order of government to try to pull something unexpected,” McDougall explained.

“So it kind of evolved together into this more collaborative relationship. And then some of the politics that was behind (it) sort of faded a little bit.”

The development of new institutions and communications channels have also led to the creation of their “own norms,” which have a “constraining factor on what the expectations are and what’s possible,” according to McDougall.

Intergovernmental relations, he said, have been “notoriously flexible” when it comes to what governments want to do, but there is a “constraining force that comes in from these past practices that developed when you see the same people over and over again.”

While McDougall’s study credits developments in the labour market arena by the current federal Liberal government, such as reaching workplace development agreements with all the provinces and territories and collaborating to create the Labour Market Information Council and Future Skills Centre, he said this work towards improved intergovernmental relations has been a “long standing process.”

However, he said it has been helped by the Liberal government’s greater emphasis on skills training and working with the provinces, in contrast to the “open federalism” practised by the former Harper government that was more focused on the different orders of governments staying in their own jurisdictional avenues.

For example, the Liberals in the 2019 budget introduced a new personalized training benefit program, dubbed the Canada Training Benefit. The benefit includes a $250 non-taxable credit to help pay for training fees and four weeks of income support through the Employment Insurance program that will help workers cover living expenses while on training (and not receiving income).",New study says intergovernmental cooperation on labour market policy has improved,politics,government policy,721
289847,lifesitenews,"VATICAN CITY, October 7, 2019 (LifeSiteNews) ― Loud cheers greeted one of the 13 bishops elevated to the College of Cardinals on Saturday afternoon.

Fans of Fridolin Ambongo Besungu, 59, the Archbishop of Kinshasa, enlivened an otherwise solemn Consistory in which bishops from around the world received their red hats from Pope Francis.

Many Congolese women present at the ceremony wore colorful dresses emblazoned with Besungu’s image, and crowds cheered when the cardinal elect appeared in St. Peter’s Basilica.

When Besungu received his red hat, the Congolese among the congregation cheered again and waved flags vigorously ― even from a press box hovering over the assembled bishops.

The other twelve cardinals elect at the ceremony were Michael Czerny, SJ, 73, of Canada; Michael Fitzgerald, 82, of England; Álvero Ramazzini Imeri, 72, the Bishop of Huehuetenango, Guatemala; Cristóbal López Romero, S.D.B., 64, the Spanish-born Archbishop of Rabat, Morocco; Eugenio dal Corso, 80, the Italian Bishop Emeritus of Benguela; Ignatius Suharyo Hardjoatmodjo, 69, the Archbishop of Jakarta; Jean-Claude Hollerich, 61, the Archbishop of Luxembourg; José Tolentino Calaça de Mendonça, 53, of Portugal; Juan de la Caridad García Rodríguez, 71, the Archbishop of Havana; Matteo Zuppi, 63, the Archbishop of Bologna; Miguel Ángel Ayuso Guixot, 67, of Spain; and Sigitas Tamkevicius, 81, the Archbishop Emeritus of Kaunas, Lithuania.

Having attained the age of 80, Cardinals Fitzgerald, Dal Corso, and Tamkevicius are too old to vote in any future conclave.

The celebration, which was conducted partly in Latin, ended with the choir and congregation singing “Salve Regina.”

After the celebration in St. Peter’s, Pope Francis and the new cardinals took a bus to the Mater Ecclesia Monastery for a meeting with Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said that Benedict reminded the cardinals of the “value of fidelity to the Pope,” and then “together with Pope Francis,” gave them a blessing.

Pope Francis then went home to the Casa Santa Marta, and the new cardinals were taken to the Paul VI Hall and the Apostolic Palace for the “Courtesy Visits.” During these audiences, the press had the opportunity to greet and photograph the new cardinals before their guests arrived.

According to Vatican News, the choice of cardinals, eight of whom belong to religious orders, reflects the “missionary vocation of the Church.” However, it also seems to reflect Pope Francis’ interest in migration, Latin America, and interreligious dialogue with Islam.

Three of the new cardinals have critics wondering about their orthodoxy.

Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, the Archbishop of Bologna, is a well-known “street priest” well-liked for his support for the cause of migrants, the elderly, gypsies, and drug addicts, and the peacemaking Community of Sant’Egidio. News that Zuppi would be getting a red hat caused the Italian Left to cry, “We have a Cardinal!” Meanwhile, Zuppi contributed an essay to the Italian edition of Fr. James Martin’s Building a Bridge: How the Catholic Church and the LGBT Community Can Enter into a Relationship of Respect, Compassion, and Sensitivity, a collaboration Fr. Martin has publicized.

However, according to Edward Pentin of the National Catholic Register, Archbishop Zuppi’s supporters have said “that his position is more nuanced than Father Martin has made it out to be … and that while the archbishop calls for a more sensitive pastoral approach in his foreword, he reasserts the Church’s teaching on the issue and calls faithfully Catholic outreach groups such as Courage ‘instructive.’”

Cardinal José Tolentino Calaça de Mendonça is an award-winning Portugese poet and essayist. He was appointed Vatican Archivist and Librarian to the Holy See by Pope Francis in 2018. But he too is a controversial figure, having written the introduction to a book on feminist theology by Benedictine Sister Maria Teresa Forcades. Labelled as “Europe’s most radical nun” by the BBC, Sister Forcades is known for promoting “queer theology” and supporting abortion and the morning-after pill.

Cardinal Miguel Ángel Ayuso Guixot belongs to the Comboni Missionaries of the Heart of Jesus. He is a renowed expert on Islam and was appointed President of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue by Pope Francis this May.

Before his appointment as head of the pontifical council, Archbishop Guixot served as president of the Pontifical Institute for Arab and Islamic Studies in Rome. In this role, he was in charge of overseeing the dialogue between the Vatican and the prestigious Al-Azhar mosque and university in Egypt, considered the Vatican of the Sunni Islamic world. Archbishop Ayuso played a key role in drawing up the “Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together” co-signed in early February by Pope Francis and Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, grand imam of Al-Azhar, in Abu Dhabi.

The document has drawn considerable controversy for stating that the “diversity of religions” is “willed by God.” Despite Bishop Athanasius Schneider's appeal to Pope Francis to officially correct the text, last week, the Vatican announced that a “Higher Committee” had been established in the United Arab Emirates to implement the uncorrected document. Members of the seven-member (Catholic and Muslim) commission include Pope Francis’s personal secretary, Fr. Yoannis Lahzi Gaid, and Archbishop Ayuso Giuxot.

The other 10 cardinals have not rung the alarm bells of orthodoxy as loudly.

Cardinal Michael Czerny, SJ, came to Canada as a toddler from Communist-era Czechoslovakia. He is under-secretary of the Migrants and Refugees Section of the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development. He was elevated to the episcopate by Pope Francis on October 4, one day before being created a cardinal.

Cardinal Michael Fitzgerald is an expert in Christian-Muslim relations, a former apostolic nuncio to Egypt, and also a former President of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue.

Cardinal Álvero Ramazzini Imeri, Bishop of Huehuetenango, has been described as “dedicated to the poorest people” of Guatemala “for decades” and “to migrants and indigenous people in particular.” The Diocese of Huehuetenango covers almost 3,000 square miles is situated in Guatemala’s remote north-west.

Cardinal Cristóbal López Romero, S.D.B., Archbishop of Rabat, is a Salesian who worked and ministered in Paraguay for decades before moving to Morocco in 2003. During Pope Francis’ 2017 visit, he described his Morroccan archdiocese as multicultural, noting that it serves many migrants from farther south in Africa.

Cardinal Eugenio dal Corso belongs to the congregation of the Poor Servants of the Divine and ministered in both Argentina and Angola. In Angolo, Dal Corso served as the Provincial Superior of his order, then as Bishop of Saurimo and finally as Bishop of Benguela. He retired from the latter post at the age of 78.

Cardinal Ignatius Suharyo Hardjoatmodjo, the Archbishop of Jakarta, has spoken up for the rights of Indonesia’s Christian minority and is a member of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples.

Cardinal Jean-Claude Hollerich, SJ, Archbishop of Luxembourg, is fervently pro-European Union and was elected president of the Commission of the Bishops' Conferences of the European Union (COMECE) in 2018.

Cardinal Juan de la Caridad García Rodríguez has been the Archbishop of Havana since 2016. He is on the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace.

Cardinal Sigitas Tamkevicius is the Archbishop Emeritus of Kaunas, Lithuania. He was appointed by St. John Paul II in 1996. Persecuted by the Communist authorities in Cold War-era Lithuania, he was arrested in 1983 and sent to prison camps. In 1988 he was exiled to Siberia. He was allowed to return to Lithuania after the political softening that marked the perestroika period under Mikhail Gorbechev.

332777,nationalreview,"Billed an ""equality"" town hall, the CNN event was anything but.

LGBT activists gathered last week for CNN’s “Equality” town hall with the Democratic presidential candidates. The advocates present were, in the words of Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David, the “tip of the spear in our fight for full equality.”

The “spear” metaphor grew more apt as the night went on.

Religious freedom was the second-most-popular whipping post. The candidates talked about the concept with palpable derision, as if religion — save Islam, which they predictably if incoherently exempted — were a ruse used to cement old prejudices. No one actually believes those folksy things about God, heaven, and hell, right? Never considered was the notion that people hold earnest religious beliefs that in turn inform their views on sexual morality.

The town hall was also evidence that the LGBTQ movement has grown more jaded and contemptuous, even as it has achieved more and more of its ostensible aims. If conciliation was ever the preferred tone, it is no longer. Instead, it is now increasingly unashamed and vituperative scorn.

How would Elizabeth Warren, for instance, respond to someone on the campaign trail who said that they believed in the traditional definition of marriage? “Well, I’m gonna assume it’s a guy who said that,” she said. That elicited a laugh from the audience, men being the only acceptable punchline to the humorless scolds in the crowd. She continued, “I’m gonna say then just marry one woman. I’m cool with that.” Then, after a pause: “If you can find one.”

Beto O’Rourke piled on further, affirming his belief that “freedom of religion is a fundamental right, but it should not be used to discriminate.”

You are, in other words, “free” to practice your religion, so long as you practice it in a manner that Beto O’Rourke — the skateboard-wielding ex-congressman who posts videos of his dental visits on social media — sees fit. Some animals are more equal than others: O’Rourke will be happy to “discriminate” against your church if it happens to hold an unpopular position on sexual ethics. He literally said so seconds later, when asked by Don Lemon if religious institutions should “lose their tax-exempt status if they oppose same sex marriage.” O’Rourke’s response:

What “human right” are religious organizations “infringing upon” when they “oppose” same-sex marriage? Do people have a “civil right” to have their sexual preferences validated by private religious organizations? Is there a “human right” to have your particular sexual union baptized by religious traditions with centuries of contravening theological directives?

Pete Buttigieg took this same tack, insisting that “the right to religious freedom ends where religion is being used as an excuse to harm other people.” Which of course depends entirely on what Buttigieg means by “harm.” There is certainly “harm,” for instance, in mutilating the genitals of a young girl — a more ecumenical venture than progressives care to admit — but does a baker’s refusal to bake a cake that violates his religious convictions “harm other people”? What if a church refuses to host a ceremony that offends its moral precepts? Does “religious freedom end” when someone refuses to grant moral approbation to someone else’s choices and behavior?

Indeed, that was the Freudian subtext of the entire town hall. “Equality?” That has, even on activists’ own terms, been long achieved. Notice, Alphonso David didn’t simply want “equality” — whatever that means — but “full equality”: your approval. Not simply your toleration, but your moral assent and your unhesitating affirmation. It’s not enough to live and let live. You will, in Erick Erickson’s words, “be made to care.”

First, we were told that good sense held that we ought to allow two consenting adults to do as they wished in the privacy of their own bedroom. Fair enough — what business is it of ours? Next came civil unions. Fine. Then, marriage was redefined at a federal level on the basis of specious legal reasoning. Next, religious florists, bakers, and caterers were asked to violate their consciences and dragged before the courts if they declined. And now, at long last, the public exercise of religious faith, and the very belief itself, the very notion that one has rights to “oppose” practices that violate their private conscience, are under siege.

All of which, we were told, would “never happen.” As the town hall put on display, it’s not for want of trying.",CNN’s Anti-Religious Town Hall,religion and belief,religious institutions and state relations,726

5060,activistpost,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (July 24, 2019) – Today, a bill that reforms Arkansas’ asset forfeiture laws to prohibit the state from taking a person’s property without a criminal conviction in most situations went into effect. Arkansas has already taken a step to shut a loophole that would allow state and local police to circumvent the more stringent state asset forfeiture process by passing cases off to the feds.

Sen Bart Hester (R-Cave Springs) sponsored Senate Bill 308 (SB308). The new law specifically ends civil asset forfeiture in most Arkansas cases and replaces it with a criminal procedure. Under the law, prosecutors cannot proceed with forfeiture without a criminal conviction in all but a handful of cases.

The Institute for Justice gave Arkansas former forfeiture laws a D- grade, calling them “awful.”

The House passed SB308 by a 93-0 vote. The Senate approved the measure 35-0. With Gov. Asa Hutchinson’s signature in March, the new law went into effect July 24.

While some people believe the Supreme Court “ended asset forfeiture,” the recent opinion in Timbs v. Indiana ended nothing. Without further action, civil asset forfeiture remains. Additionally, as law professor Ilya Somin noted, the Court left an important issue unresolved. What exactly counts as an “excessive” in the civil forfeiture context?

Going forward, opponents of civil asset forfeiture could wait and see how lower federal courts will address this “over the next few years,” or they can do what a number of states have already taken steps to do, end the practice on a state level, and opt out of the federal equitable sharing program as well.

While the current asset forfeiture process in Arkansas desperately needed reforming, the state had already taken a step toward withdrawing from a federal program that allows state and local police to circumvent the state process. This is key now that SB308 has become law. And it’s particularly important in light of a policy directive issued in July 2017 by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions for the Department of Justice (DOJ).

A federal program known as “Equitable Sharing” allows prosecutors to bypass more stringent state asset forfeiture laws by passing cases off to the federal government through a process known as adoption. The DOJ directive reiterates full support for the equitable sharing program, directs federal law enforcement agencies to aggressively utilize it, and sets the stage to expand it in the future.

Law enforcement agencies can circumvent more strict state forfeiture laws by claiming cases are federal in nature. Under these arrangements, state officials simply hand cases over to a federal agency, participate in the case, and then receive up to 80 percent of the proceeds. However, when states merely withdraw from participation, the federal directive loses its impact.

Until recently, California faced this situation. The state has some of the strongest state-level restrictions on civil asset forfeiture in the country, but state and local police were circumventing the state process by passing cases to the feds. According to a report by the Institute for Justice, Policing for Profit, California ranked as the worst offender of all states in the country between 2000 and 2013. In other words, California law enforcement was passing off a lot of cases to the feds and collecting the loot. The state closed the loophole in 2016.

Arkansas law prohibits the transfer of property to the feds without judicial approval.

(1) No state or local law enforcement agency may transfer any property seized by the state or local agency to any federal entity for forfeiture under federal law unless the circuit court having jurisdiction over the property enters an order, upon petition by the prosecuting attorney, authorizing the property to be transferred to the federal entity. (2) The transfer shall not be approved unless it reasonably appears that the activity giving rise to the investigation or seizure involves more than one (1) state or the nature of the investigation or seizure would be better pursued under federal law.

As the Tenth Amendment Center previously reported the federal government inserted itself into the asset forfeiture debate in California. The feds clearly want the policy to continue.

We can only guess. But perhaps the feds recognize paying state and local police agencies directly in cash for handling their enforcement would reveal their weakness. After all, the federal government would find it nearly impossible to prosecute its unconstitutional “War on Drugs” without state and local assistance. Asset forfeiture “equitable sharing” provides a pipeline the feds use to incentivize state and local police to serve as de facto arms of the federal government by funneling billions of dollars into their budgets.",New Arkansas Law Ends Civil Asset Forfeiture,"crime, law and justice",law enforcement,734
28253,bbc,"California is set to become the first US state to ban discrimination against natural hair.

The new bill, which the Senate passed in April, amends anti-discrimination laws to include ""traits historically associated with race"" and ""blackness"".

It bars discrimination against black hairstyles in schools and workplaces.

California's assembly voted unanimously in favour of the measure on Thursday, sending it to Governor Gavin Newsom's desk for signing into law.

The update to the law comes after years of nationwide reports of black students being sent home from school over braids or natural styles that violated dress code rules.

In the workplace, black employees have often reported unfair policies that describe natural hair as unhygienic and unprofessional. The US military had a ban on dreadlocks for women until 2017.

""Professionalism was, and still is, closely linked to European features and mannerisms, which entails that those who do not naturally fall into Eurocentric norms must alter their appearances, sometimes drastically and permanently, in order to be deemed professional,"" the California bill states.

""Hair remains a rampant source of racial discrimination with serious economic and health consequences, especially for black individuals.""

The bill has been referred to as the Crown (Create a Respectful and Open Workplace for Natural Hair) Act and was sponsored by Democratic Senator Holly Mitchell, who is black.

It passed 69-0 and notes that while afros are protected federally by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, black individuals are unfairly affected - deterred, burdened or punished - by dress code policies targeting ""braids, twists and locks"".

New York City enacted a similar anti-discrimination policy in February. The city's Human Rights Law now protects ""natural hair or hairstyles that are closely associated with their racial, ethnic or cultural identities"".

Black hair has been controlled and policed for centuries - during the 1700s in Louisiana, women of colour, whether they were enslaved or not, were ordered to cover their hair with scarves.

For decades in the US, black women have used sometimes dangerous or damaging chemical methods to straighten their natural hair. These harsh treatments could permanently damage hair, cause it to fall out, or burn the scalp.

California's measure, which is expected to be signed into law by the governor, has been praised on social media.

But some supporters have also pointed out that no other hair texture has needed legislation to prevent discrimination.",California set to be first US state to ban hair discrimination,society,discrimination,378

Interior Minister Salvini's anti-migrant League had sought the vote after he pulled the plug on the coalition last week. But a majority of senators from former coalition partners Five Star Movement (M5S) and from the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) opposition rejected the motion.

Instead, lawmakers approved an M5S-PD motion calling for a debate next week during which Conte would address the Senate on the crisis.

Senators were recalled at the height of the holiday season after groupings in the chamber on Monday failed to agree on a timetable for the vote demanded by Salvini.

Salvini kicked off Tuesday's debate with a stunning U-turn, offering to back a key parliamentary reform of the M5S which last week he said he could no longer work with.

In exchange, the anti-establishment M5S would back his call for swift elections despite Salvini's anti-immigration League party withdrawing from the increasingly acrimonious alliance.

While the government is still in place, the Senate decides whether to initiate a no-confidence vote in the 14-month-old administration of Conte, an independent agreed to by deputy prime ministers Salvini and M5S leader Luigi Di Maio last year.

After little support emerged for his call for a no-confidence motion in the Senate, Salvini on Tuesday offered to support the M5S's reform that would slash the number of lawmakers from 950 to 605.

""Let's vote the cut of 345 parliamentarians and then let's hold an election immediately,"" Salvini announced during the noisy Senate session.

The M5S, PD and other parties have been holding talks on a transitional government to pass the parliamentary reform and next year's budget to avoid an automatic rise in VAT which would hit the least well-off the hardest.

Salvini had wanted a vote on Conte as early as Wednesday and for elections to follow in October to capitalise on opinion polls suggesting the League could garner 36-38 percent of votes.

Populist leader Salvini effectively ended the ruling alliance on Thursday, saying afterwards he had had enough of working with the M5S and what he said was its refusal to collaborate on key issues.

The two parties have seen a stunning reversal of fortunes since forming a government after the M5S won more than 32 percent of votes and the League 17 percent in 2018.

The social media-loving Salvini has been burnishing his ""man of the people"" image through a series of beach selfies in swimming trunks in recent days, seeking to build on the League's strong showing in May's European Parliament elections when the party won 34 percent of the vote, twice that of the M5S.

Matteo Renzi, who was PD premier from 2014-16, warned on Tuesday that snap elections would be a disaster and plunge Italy into recession, also promising to unite his supporters with those of PD secretary Zingaretti.

""The secretariat of my party has asked that there be unity... I believe that they are understandable requests and absolutely to be accepted,"" he said.

""Lawmakers must today say that Salvini is in the minority,"" Renzi said shortly before the debate, suggesting that even League leaders were surprised at how the crisis has unfolded negatively for them.

""We have the chance to turn the page,"" Renzi said, extending a hand to the M5S for a new coalition.

Both the PD and M5S are divided on whether to form an improvised alliance with each other, something the PD refused to do after last May's elections, prompting the unwieldy M5S-League alliance.

Di Maio on Monday said ""no one wants to sit at the table with Renzi.""

Salvini is also seeking allies, both in the Senate and for possible elections, in the form of former premier Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia and the post-fascist Brothers of Italy of Giorgia Meloni.

While those two parties might each win six to eight percent of votes in an election, they will not be able to provide enough support in the Senate.",Italy senate delays no-confidence vote amid political crisis,politics,political crisis,693

As well as donations from the public after a visit to the Cameron Toll centre’s free Santa’s grotto, the charity raised a total of £2729.33 from a range of fundraising activity including gift wrapping, sales of reindeer dust and Santa cocoa and a Christmas raffle.

The charity also hosted carol singing in the mall that featured local group Star Harmonies.

The total raised was the highest ever Christmas charity collection at Cameron Toll in Edinburgh.

The Livingston-based charity, which was inspired by teenager Jak Trueman whose life was sadly cut short following a brief and aggressive battle with a rare form of blood cancer, provides practical, social and emotional support to children and young people with cancer and related illnesses, their family and friends and those bereaved.

Allison Barr, CEO at Team Jak said: “We are blown away by the support from all the shoppers at Cameron Toll. They really embraced our charity and we received a very warm welcome.

""We are looking forward to a fabulous year ahead with the opening of our new, bigger, more accessible Den, scheduled to open May 2019.

""The monies raised from the Christmas Activities at Cameron Toll will be going towards the cost of a beautiful bespoke memorial angel tree to remember Jak and all our angels and will have pride of place in our beautiful landscaped gardens.”

Hazel McLinden, fundraising and volunteer co-ordinator for Team Jak said: “We are delighted with the generosity shown by the customers at Cameron Toll but also with the interest shown in the charity and support offered in many other ways.

""Thank you to all the wonderful volunteers who helped us achieve this, especially so close to Christmas when everyone is busy but a massive thanks to Santa, he really was superb and it was a delight to listen to his interactions with the children. Hope to see him again Next Year.”

Claire Jefcoate from Cameron Toll Shopping Centre said: “The generosity of the shoppers has led to the highest amount we have ever raised at Christmas. Team Jak’s volunteers made Christmas at Cameron Toll and we are delighted that so much was raised for a charity that does so much for children and families facing cancer and related illness.”

Jak’s Den hosts drop-in sessions, music therapy, counselling, pamper days, alternative therapies, support groups, mindfulness, activity days including cake decorating, puppet making, magic shows, teen days- X-Box and PS4 challenges, arts and crafts, coffee mornings and much more.

In addition, the charity provides bespoke outreach support to families who can’t make it to Jak’s Den and schools support for peer groups and bereavement support.

Team Jak also provides snacks and goody bags to Ward 2 at the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital and sponsors the Palliative and Bereavement Teams Rainbow Cart which provides items to make a room more homely when a child is sadly going to gain their wings in hospital.

The charity partnership with Cameron Toll Shopping Centre sees Team Jak working with the centre management and its retailers to fundraise and increase awareness of the charity to help it grow and provide care for children, and their families, living with cancer.

6869,ageofautism,"The venerated Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote the decision upholding the Virginia law that ended a woman's right to be a mother, by saying it was no different than vaccination:

But even those who know about poor Carrie Buck may not know that the mandatory vaccine laws were the justification for this decision.  They used our old friend Jacobson, the Massachusetts minister who refused to pay a five dollar fee imposed by the state on those rejecting the smallpox vaccine during a deadly outbreak in 1905, and took it all the way to the Supreme Court.

""The concept of eugenics had been put forward in 1883 by Francis Galton, who also coined the name. The trend first became popular in the United States, and found proponents in Europe by the start of the 20th century; 42 of the 58 research papers presented at the First International Congress of Eugenics held in London in 1912, were from American scientists. Indiana passed the first eugenic sterilization statute (1907), but it was legally flawed. To remedy this situation, Harry Laughlin of the Eugenics Record Office (ERO) at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, designed a model eugenic law that was reviewed by legal experts. In 1924 the Commonwealth of Virginia adopted a statute authorizing the compulsory sterilization of the intellectually disabled for the purpose of eugenics. This 1924 statute was closely based on Laughlin's model. Looking to determine if the new law would pass a legal challenge, on September 10, 1924 Dr. Albert Sidney Priddy, superintendent of the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded, filed a petition to his Board of Directors to sterilize Carrie Buck, an 18-year-old patient at his institution who he claimed had a mental age of 9. Priddy maintained that Buck represented a genetic threat to society .""

Again with the Wikipedia (yes I know I being lazy by quoting the Wiki but I have to get back to my kids homework):

The case of Buck v. Bell was the atrocious matter in which Dr. Albert Sidney Pridd (and his successor, Dr. John Hendren Bell) Superintendent of The Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded , decided that one of his patients, an 18 year old rape-victim with a sixth grade education, should not be able to give birth again. Her mother was also ""feebleminded"" you see, and the good doctors believed society should be rid of their kind.

This, many of us have heard of, as it is our children that the states would be targeting if this policy of Nazi eugenics was being carried out today as it was in the 20th century, both in Nazy Germany and the US during the ""Progressive Era,"" which was embracing the idea of creating a superior society.

Wikipedia : ""Buck v. Bell, 274 U.S. 200 (1927),is a decision of the United States Supreme Court, written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., in which the Court ruled that a state statute permitting compulsory sterilization of the unfit, including the intellectually disabled, ""for the protection and health of the state"" did not violate the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court has never expressly overturned Buck v. Bell .""

""The judgment finds the facts that have been recited and that Carrie Buck 'is the probable potential parent of socially inadequate offspring, likewise afflicted, that she may be sexually sterilized without detriment to her general health and that her welfare and that of society will be promoted by her sterilization,' and thereupon makes the order. In view of the general declarations of the Legislature and the specific findings of the Court obviously we cannot say as matter of law that the grounds do not exist, and if they exist they justify the result. We have seen more than once that the public welfare may call upon the best citizens for their lives. It would be strange if it could not call upon those who already sap the strength of the State for these lesser sacrifices, often not felt to be such by those concerned, in order to prevent our being swamped with incompetence. It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes. Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 , 25 S. Ct. 358, 3 Ann. Cas. 765. Three generations of imbeciles are enough.""

Thus we can see that Jacobson v. Massachusetts is used to justify all manner of horrors in the name of ""societal good."" Poor Carrie Buck was not even given the option of paying a five dollar fine to prevent her forced sterilization, as Jacobson was to get out of taking the smallpox vaccine.

And we see in both cases, as we are living through now, these unwanted procedures that cause permanent and detrimental changes to the human body, are simply declared ""safe,"" and ""for our own good,"" just as this human rights atrocity inflicted on an innocent young woman was when it was declared to be, ""without detriment to her general health"" and that, ""her welfare... will be promoted by her sterilization.""

Almost a hundred years later and some evil arguments never die.

NYU legal scholar and member of the Supreme Court Bar, Professor Mary Holland, in her article ""Compulsory Vaccination, the Constitution, and the Hepatitis B Mandate for Infants and Young Children,"" in Yale Journal of Health Policy, Law, and Ethics, follows up on Buck in her discussion of the history of vaccine mandates:

So if SCOTUS views forced vaccination and forced sterilization as the same, then either Holmes right, and BOTH are justified by a ""compelling state interest,"" or NEITHER is justified by a ""compelling state interest.""



Buck v. Bell is both a Constitutional violation, and morally evil.  So is Jacobson.



All medical procedures require free, prior and informed consent.

So we can be clear that there are still some at the top of the medical profession that hold, and act on, this ""Nazi Philosophy"", I will leave you with Stanley Plotkin's testimony from just a year ago today, admitting to his own human rights abuses by experimenting on developmentally disabled children in creating the (now liability-free) rubella vaccine that we are being mandated into taking today:",Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Used Forced Vaccination Laws to Justify Forced Sterilization Laws,"crime, law and justice",law,1054

214316,france24,"FLORENT VERGNES/AFP | A man shows shell casings of bullets fired by the UN peacekeeping force MINUSCA and Central African troops, in PK5 district, in Bangui, on April 9, 2018.

A peace deal has been reached between the Central African Republic government and 14 armed groups in their first-ever direct dialogue, potentially ending years of conflict in the country, the United Nations and African Union announced Saturday.

The impoverished, landlocked nation has been rocked by violence since 2013 when mainly Muslim Selaka rebels ousted then president Francois Bozizé, prompting reprisals from mostly Christian militias and interreligious, intercommunal fighting.

UN peacekeepers were deployed in 2014. Thousands of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced in a conflict that has sent two people to the International Criminal Court (ICC).

The deal, the seventh since 2012, was announced on Twitter by the government of President Faustin-Archange Touadera just a day after African Union (AU) and UN-sponsored talks in Khartoum were suspended amid disagreements over amnesty.

""A peace agreement has been reached,"" said the tweet. ""This agreement should be initialled tomorrow (Sunday) and its signing will take place in Bangui in a few days"".

""I am determined to work with the president and his government to address the concerns of our brothers who took up arms,"" said Central African Republic's Cabinet Director Firmin Ngrebada, according to the UN.

On Sunday, the parties will sign a draft of the agreement, which focuses on power-sharing and transitional justice, Sudan's state media reported, citing Sudan's chief negotiator Atta al-Manan. The final deal is expected to be signed on Wednesday. Talks began January 24 in Khartoum.

""This is a great day for Central African Republic and all its people,"" said the AU commissioner for peace and security, Smail Chergui.

The fighting has carried the high risk of genocide, the UN has warned. The conflict began in 2013 when predominantly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power in the capital, Bangui. Largely Christian anti-Balaka militias fought back. Scores of mosques were burned. Priests and other religious leaders were killed. Many Muslims fled the country after mobs decapitated and dismembered some in the streets.

The conflict has also uprooted more than one million people, the UN said, and had until now shown little sign of abating.

The vicious fighting in a country known more for coups than interreligious violence was so alarming that Pope Francis made a bold visit in 2015, removing his shoes and bowing his head at the Central Mosque in the last remaining Muslim neighbourhood of the capital, Bangui.

""Together we say 'no' to hatred,"" the pope said.

The violence has never disappeared, intensifying and spreading last year after a period of relative peace as armed groups battled over lands rich in gold, diamonds and uranium.

After more than 40 people were killed in a rebel attack on a displaced persons camp in November, both the leader of the 13,000-strong UN peacekeeping mission and the country's prime minister both acknowledged shortcomings in the response. ""I knew that we did not have all the necessary means to protect our people,"" the prime minister said.

In a grim report last year marking five years of the conflict, the UN children's agency said fighters often target civilians rather than each other, attacking health facilities and schools, mosques and churches and camps for displaced people.

At least half of the more than 640,000 people displaced are children, it said, and thousands are thought to have joined the armed groups, often under pressure.

Last month the chief of Central African Republic's soccer federation appeared at the ICC for the first time since he was arrested last year in France on charges of crimes against humanity and war crimes. Patrice-Edouard Ngaïssona is accused of leading the anti-Balaka for at least a year early in the fighting.

In November 2018 another Central African Republic militia leader and lawmaker, Alfred Yekatom, made his first ICC appearance, accused of crimes including murder, torture and using child soldiers. He allegedly commanded some 3,000 fighters in a predominantly Christian militia in and around the capital early in the fighting. He was arrested last year after firing gunshots in parliament.

So far no Seleka fighters have been publicly targeted by the ICC’s chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda.

As the peace talks began last month, the Norwegian Refugee Council warned of ""catastrophe"" if no agreement was reached, saying repeated cycles of violence in one of the world's poorest nations had ""pushed people’s resistance to breaking point.""

A majority of Central African Republic's 2.9 million people urgently need humanitarian support, the group said.

19558,anonnews,"A fascinating photo was recently posted to Reddit by the user “OctopusPrime,” showing flowers that looked just like hummingbirds. People commenting on the thread discovered that the plant was a Pareidolia.

These flowers do not always look like hummingbirds, but because of how the petals grow, sometimes they do appear to show wings. Some experts who have found these plants in the wild also suggest that they sometimes look like butterflies.

A postdoc scientist studying the evolution and ecology of flowers commented on the post, explaining some of the science behind the photo.

“This plant inhabits remote and arid Australia. The fact that the flower looks like a bird to humans cannot have evolved adaptively because as a signal receiver, there is nothing humans could have done to increase the fitness of individuals that evolved this signal (to look like a bird). Unless indigenous Australians in arid Australia bred or traded the plant because it looks like a bird,” the Reddit user SolitaryBee said.

“We have no evidence for ornamental horticulture in indigenous Australian culture, further, the scarcity of water and food makes this a waste of resources, therefore highly improbable. Now one could argue that today, the plant has increased fitness because it is traded and bred due to its appearance. But that does not say anything about the selection that gave rise to the traits we find so interesting,” the anonymous scientist added.

The scientist’s post went on to explain that this is most likely an optical illusion, that is experienced only by humans based on our point of reference and how we perceive the world around us.

Most animals probably don’t recognize this plant as being the same shape as a bird. In fact, if this plant appeared to be a bird to other plants and insects, it would probably never get pollinated. This is because birds are predators to bees, so they would avoid the flower instead of pollinating it.

In the Reddit thread where the photo originated, there is a lively and intelligent discussion about the evolution of plants.

114572,cnsnews,"Rep. Ilhan Omar (D.-Minn.) reacted to a new regulation announced by the Department of Homeland Security that seeks to detain illegal aliens indefinitely but also keep illegal alien children in company with their families by sending out a Tweet saying President Donald Trump “attacks religious minorities to distract from his human rights abuses.”

Omar’s Tweet linked to a New York Times story about the newly proposed regulation.

“Just a reminder that Trump repeatedly stokes tension and attacks religious minorities to distract from him human rights abuses,” Omar said in her Tweet.

“Today his administration released a plan to detain migrant children indefinitely, even as children die in Border Patrol custody,” she said.

“Large numbers of alien families are entering illegally across the southern border, hoping that they will be released into the interior rather than detained during their removal proceedings,” said the departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services in a statement about the proposed regulation.

“Today, the government has issued a critical rule that will permit the Department of Homeland Security to appropriately hold families together and improve the integrity of the immigration system,” said Acting Secretary McAleenan. “This rule allows the federal government to enforce immigration laws as passed by Congress and ensures that all children in U.S. government custody are treated with dignity, respect, and special concern for their particular vulnerability.”

“The Department of Health and Human Services, through our Office of Refugee Resettlement, provides quality and compassionate care for unaccompanied alien children who are referred to our custody,” said Secretary Azar. “In this rule, we are implementing the relevant and substantive portions of the Flores Settlement Agreement pertaining to standards for the temporary care, placement, and release of those minors. As before, HHS will continue to protect the safety and dignity of unaccompanied alien children in our custody as we seek to place them with a parent, relative, or other suitable sponsor.”

The New York Times story that Omar linked to said:

“The Trump administration unveiled a regulation on Wednesday that would allow it to detain indefinitely migrant families who cross the border illegally, replacing a decades-old court agreement that imposed a limit on how long the government could hold migrant children in custody and specified the level of care they must receive…. “The new regulation, which requires approval from a federal judge before it can go into effect and was expected to be immediately challenged in court, would establish standards for conditions in detention centers and specifically abolish a 20-day limit on detaining families in immigration jails, a cap that has prompted President Trump to repeatedly complain about the “catch and release” of families from Central America and elsewhere into the United States.”",Ilhan Omar: ‘Trump…Attacks Religious Minorities to Distract From His Human Rights Abuses’,religion and belief,religious text,442
31276,bbc,"It's easy to list some of the many everyday items invented and patented by women - the dishwasher, windscreen wipers, the board game Monopoly, to name but a few - but the world is still failing to take full advantage of women's innovative ideas, a report suggests.

Women inventors account for just under 13% of patent applications globally, according to the study, by the UK's Intellectual Property Office (IPO). That's one female inventor for every seven male ones.

And although the proportion among patent applications is increasing, at the current rate it won't reach gender parity until 2070.

So, why are there so few women in the world of inventing?

Researchers attribute the gap to a lack of women working in science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem). According to Penny Gilbert, partner at intellectual property law firm Powell & Gilbert, it's simply a pipeline issue.

""If we want to see more women filing patents, then we need to see more women taking up Stem subjects at university and going on to careers in research,"" she says.

Currently only about a quarter of the UK workforce in Stem industries is female and fewer girls and women study these subjects at secondary school and university, despite efforts to diagnose and solve this imbalance.

Patents are granted to the owner of an invention, allowing the creator and subsequent owners to prevent others from using their invention. In order to qualify as an ""invention"" patent, the filing must contain a new, useful idea - that would not be obvious to a skilled person in that field.

They can be filed individually, or by teams of inventors.

The gender disparity among inventors grows even starker when you take into account most female inventorship takes the form of a lone female on a male-dominated team.

More than two-thirds of all patents come from all-male teams or individual male inventors - and just 6% from individual female inventors.

All-female teams are nearly non-existent, making up just 0.3% of applications, according to the IPO.

Even when they apply for patents, women may be less likely to receive them, according to a study of US patent applications, by Yale University researchers. They found applicants with an obviously female name were less likely to have their patent approved.

And of course, not everyone involved in an invention is credited with a patent.

All in all, female scientists are less than half as likely to obtain a patent for their research, according to a previous World Intellectual Property Organisation study, suggesting women may be less likely than men to think about commercialising their inventions.

In 1991, Ann Tsukamoto developed a way to isolate stem cells. Her innovation led to great advancements in understanding the blood systems of cancer patients and could lead to a cure for the disease.

Dr Tsukamoto, who is currently conducting further research into stem cell growth, is also the co-patentee on more than seven other inventions.

Biotechnology, the use of living organisms to produce useful products such as medicine and food, is the sector with the highest proportion of female inventors. Some 53% of biotechnology-related patents have at least one female inventor.

In second place, 52% of pharmaceutical-related patents have at least one female inventor.

Electrical engineering was at the bottom of the list, with fewer than one in 10 applications having at least one female inventor.

The proportion of women inventors has doubled in the past 20 years, according to the IPO, from just 6.8% in 1998 to 12.7% in 2017, the latest year for which full data is available.

During the same period, the proportion of applications naming at least one woman among the inventors rose from 12% to 21%.

Dr Gilbert says stereotypes around women's educational and career choices need to be tackled - by encouraging women to choose Stem areas, introducing mentoring schemes, and celebrating female role models.

""We should applaud the fact that some of the greatest scientists and inventors throughout history have been women - from Marie Curie and Rosalind Franklin to Grace Hopper, [a computer programming pioneer], and Stephanie Kwolek, the inventor of Kevlar,"" she says.

""We should tell their stories.""

Although female inventorship in the UK has increased, from 8% in 1998 to 11% in 2017, other countries are well ahead.

With 17% of patent applications including at least one woman over the past 20 years, Russia had the highest proportion of female inventors, out of the 10 countries with the most patent applications, followed by France.

At the other end of the scale, in Japan and South Korea fewer than one in 20 patent applications included a female inventor during the time period.

The gender of inventors is usually not included in patent applications, so the IPO inferred gender based on inventors' first names, using data from the European Patent Office Worldwide Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT).

Inventors' names were matched to a gender using birth data from the UK's Office for National Statistics and the US Social Security Administration, which lists the names of all babies born, and the number of male and female entries, as well as by crawling Facebook profiles to create a larger list of names and their likely gender.

Only names for which at least 95% of entries were male or female were included, so gender-neutral names such as ""Robin"" have been excluded.

A total of 75% of inventors' names were matched to a gender, although this success rate varies country by country. The name lists used were biased towards Western names, so the UK has the highest ""success rate"", while countries in East Asia, including South Korea and China, have a lower rate.

773109,theindependent,"A mysterious oil spill that has polluted shores along a vast area of Brazil’s northeast may have resulted from unspecified criminal activity, and a foreign country could be responsible, president Jair Bolsonaro said Tuesday.

An estimated 100 tons of crude has drifted towards land since early September, polluting some of the country’s most pristine beaches and forcing Brazilian officials to grapple with yet another environmental crisis. The government has already come under close scrutiny and heavy criticism after an unusually intense season of forest fires in the Amazon.

Now, oil has been spotted on at least 132 beaches affecting 61 municipalities in nine states, the country’s Environment Ministry said.

Officials have said the state oil company, Petrobras, is not responsible for the spill and that the crude is neither produced in nor exported to Brazil.

Mr Bolsonaro told reporters Tuesday that the government had a theory of what led to the spill, adding that a country is on “the radar.” He declined to elaborate, saying: “I can’t accuse a country. If it turns out it’s not that country, I don’t want to create problems with other countries.”

Ricardo Salles, the minister of the environment, flew over part of the affected area Sunday and said the government was taking “urgent measures to address pollution.”

The spill prompted the state of Sergipe to declare an emergency last week, and officials there have warned residents to stop going to certain beaches. The crude has also set off concern about wildlife. Biologists have treated several turtles that have washed ashore covered in crude, but some have died.

The spill comes as Mr Bolsonaro’s government has come under withering criticism from abroad for weakening environmental policies and agencies while taking steps to open up protected lands in the Amazon to industries.","Mysterious oil spill marks fresh environmental crisis for Brazil, affecting more than 100 beaches",environment,natural resources,289
128320,dailyheraldchicago,"With physical health, most people embrace the philosophy that preventive care provided by a vaccine is cheaper, easier and safer than a hospital stay to treat a case of potentially fatal measles.

That same concept is true with mental health, says state House Rep. Michelle Mussman, a Democrat from Schaumburg who serves on legislative committees that deal with mental health, human services and elementary education. Paying for the proper psychological help today could save taxpayer money that might otherwise be needed for expensive emergency room visits, hospital stays or prison.

""If I had just gotten you help in the community, could you stay out of that situation?"" Mussman asked Monday after watching a presentation of ""telepsychiatry,"" which allows someone with a mental health issue to talk with a psychiatrist by way of an online video conference.

Mussman, whose 56th House District covers all or parts of Hanover Park, Keeneyville, Roselle, Elk Grove Village, Hoffman Estates, Palatine, Schaumburg and Rolling Meadows, joined fellow state Reps. Robyn Gabel, an Evanston Democrat, and Justin Slaughter, a Democrat who represents the South Side of Chicago, for a presentation by Regroup, a Chicago company that is a leader in the telepsychiatry field.

Many studies have found that telepsychiatry is just as effective as meeting with a psychiatrist face to face in an office, said Dr. Hossam Mahmoud, medical direct for Regroup.

And Dr. Omar Elhaj, a psychologist who talked to the Chicago group by way of a camera in his Ohio home, said ""sometimes it's even better than face to face.""

Elhaj recently treated a prison inmate serving a term for murder who was upset after not being granted permission to attend the funeral of his wife of 25 years. During the session, the doctor, who has worked exclusively as a telepsychiatrist the past two years, pointed his camera out his window so the inmate ""could see the grass where his wife would be buried.""

""That camera gave me something nothing else could have,"" Elhaj said.

Prisons save money by using telepsychiatry instead of transporting a patient to a facility, said David Cohn, founder and CEO of Regroup. Schools can use telepsychiatry in emergencies the same way the school nurse can treat a skinned knee.

The cost of a two-day hospital stay could pay for 50 telepsychiatry sessions, Mahmoud said.

Mussman said mental health issues have no boundaries.

""We talk about mental health in a number of committees,"" she said. ""There's a whole lot of pieces that overlap.""

She notes that one in four Illinois residents has a mental health need at least once a year. ""What are we doing to see those needs get met?"" Mussman said. ""It's something we've got to figure out.""

A second group of Illinois legislators, including Rep. Deborah Conroy, a Democrat from Elmhurst, will see the Regroup presentation on Friday.

Regroup provides 10,000 telepsychiatry sessions a month across 20 states, but 70 percent of those cases are in Illinois. More than 4.8 million people in Illinois reside in areas without the necessary behavioral health care, according to research from the Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics at the University of Southern California.

Many of the mental health issues involve people who receive Medicaid benefits, and Illinois has the eighth-lowest reimbursement rate among the 50 states, which can be a disincentive for physicians to accept patients, the research showed. Some private insurance providers won't cover telepsychiatry.

701013,theguardianuk,"As you enter Roman Road Gallery in London’s East End, the noise from a pair of speakers in the foyer is almost overwhelming: grunts, exhalations and the thud of heavy metal weights landing on the floor. Recorded in a bodybuilder’s gym, this is an introductory soundscape for Alix Marie’s show, Shredded.

“I want the viewer to enter an environment that is immediately uncomfortable, almost scary,” says the Paris-born artist, whose work merges photography and sculpture and tends towards the grotesque. “I have amplified what the novelist Kathy Acker, herself a bodybuilder, called ‘the language of the body’ as it undergoes this extreme transformation and essentially breaks down.”

In the main gallery, the noise is different but no less relentless. Fans pump air into three inflatable polyester torsos – all bulging biceps, veiny skin and straining muscle – that stand erect and quivering on a raised shelf. As a metaphor for extreme bodybuilding, the pumped-up photo-sculptures are both disturbing and surreal. Likewise the images in the light boxes below, more close-ups of bulging bodies that seem to be sweating under bright spotlights. On closer inspection, they are mounted on shallow vitrines half-filled with liquid. On the opposite wall, cut-out silhouettes of pumped-up bodies are arranged in a row – arms, chests and necks, thighs as big as tree trunks. The combined effect of the noise and image overload in such a confined space is claustrophobic, ultra-masculine, almost intimidating. But also oddly camp.

“Good,” says Alix Marie, laughing. “Bodybuilding is a performance of extreme virility but, in competition, it also comprises huge men almost naked except for tight gold pants. For me, the contrast of the machismo and the campness is fascinating. When they perform they become moving sculptures, as much Auguste Rodin as Arnie Schwarzenegger.”

It was the young Arnie who, in the 1977 documentary Pumping Iron, famously likened the ritual of professional bodybuilding to having sex with a woman: “I am coming day and night. It’s terrific, right … I’m in heaven.” For Alix Marie the fascination was more about the ways in which masculinity is exhibited and performed in extremis in an enclosed, all male world. The bodies that feature in her exhibition belong to three men she photographed in gyms in Bethnal Green, Ealing and Tottenham. “I used to live opposite the one in Tottenham,” she says, “After some persuasion, they let me in to their boxing room for a total of five minutes to shoot the model. I guess they didn’t want to freak out the clientele with a female presence.”

Shredded – the term describes someone with extremely low body fat and very well defined muscles – continues Marie’s interest in “body, gender and sculpture.” In the past, she has cast her own body parts in grey concrete and printed the images on glass, fabric, paper-mache and PVC. For one show, she draped images of nude torsos on metal scaffolding and, for another, plastic pipes of fluids snaked along the gallery floor, erupting out of sculptures that looked like mutant sexual organs straight out of a David Cronenberg movie. She cites the aberrant film-maker as a prime influence alongside the surrealists. Her most powerfully unsettling work seems to come from a similar source – the realm of the unconscious and irrational, but it is tempered with a consistent formal discipline and a desire to somehow meld two creative practices that do not tend to sit together easily.

“It is challenging to work with photography as sculpture, but it is what has always fascinated me,” she says, “I never wanted to chose between the eye and the hand. In a way, I want to go inside the photograph, which is, of course, impossible. Also, I need physical contact in the making of the work, but as a big part of the viewer’s experience of it.”

A small survey of Marie’s work was on show earlier this month at Photo London. It included a ceramic sculpture in which an image of a human eye was continuously drenched in absinthe from a perspex fountain. (The tableau refers to a French wedding night tradition in which the groom places an icon of an eye in a bidet used by the bride.) Visitors could kneel and drink from the absinthe fountain if they so wished. In the context of her recent work, it was a user-friendly piece. Across town, in a group show called Apparatus, at Peckham 24, things were more brutally physical with outsize inflated polystyrene sculptures of muscular arms rotating on a contraption that called to mind a kebab skewer. “I like the idea of the viewer being simultaneously fascinated and repulsed,” she says. “The environments I create are often uncomfortable. They demand a reaction.”

Alix Marie is part of a generation of young mostly female photographers, including Juno Calypso and Maisie Cousins, whose work explores notions of femininity, eroticism, gender and body image. In contrast to the uninhibited physicality of Cousins’s more sensual close-ups of brightly-lit, glistening bodies, lips and tongues, Marie’s work is often defined by her interest in the grotesque. Fluids, flesh-coloured tubing and rubber sculptures that resemble mutant sex aids have all featured in her work. She cites the transgressive writings of Georges Bataille as another abiding influence alongside the still-shocking fetishistic doll sculptures of Hans Bellmer. “As a feminist,” she muses, “I have to ask myself why is he one of my favourite artists?”

French film, too, is a touchstone. At Photo London, an image printed on fabric of male hands buried in female hair rippled just above ground level in the artificial breeze created by a hidden fan. It could have been taken from a French nouvelle vague movie.

“I was raised watching a film a day,” she says of her childhood in Paris. Born in 1993, her mother was a screenwriter and her father a film theorist, historian and lecturer. “They really don’t get what I do, but they are hugely supportive,” she says.

Alix Marie has lived in London for 11 years, studying fine art at Central Saint Martins before completing an MA in photography at the Royal College of Art. She says: “One of the things that most interests me is the clinical aspect of analogue photography that somehow links it to medicine – the technicians, the laboratory, the baths, the gloves, the scalpel. For me, it is essentially a laboratory process and I approach it as such, as a place of experimentation and exploration.”

What has she learned from her immersion in the world of extreme bodybuilding? “I don’t think I have ever been in a more self-conscious environment,” she says. “It’s about looking strong, about poise and pose. Being ripped, as they call it, is increasingly popular, but the bodybuilders still feel they are treated like freaks. It is a very enclosed world.” She pauses for a moment, “I would describe it as being very formal, very repetitive, an activity that lies between science and art.” She breaks into laughter. “Then again, I could just as easily be talking about photography.”

643099,thedailyrecord,"The Scottish Government is facing calls to bring in an outright ban on electric shock collars for pets.

Scottish Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham announced last year she would take steps to effectively and ""promptly ban"" the use of the collars in Scotland and guidance was issued on their use.

However, the government later clarified that use of the devices, which campaigners argue is painful and cruel for animals, is not prohibited.

Conservative MSP Maurice Golden said: ""Over 20,000 people signed my petition to ban these harmful devices which cause so much harm to dogs.

""That is why it is hugely disappointing that the Government have completely failed to deliver on their promise to ban these harmful devices.

""This is an issue that cannot be kicked into the long grass, the Government must act urgently and outline plans that will see electric shock collars for dogs banned once and for all.""

Golden hosted a drop-in event at the Scottish Parliament last week for MSPs to pledge their support for an outright ban.

The UK Government announced plans in August to ban electronic shock collars for pets and the devices are banned in Wales.

Rachel Casey, of the Dogs Trust, said: ""We are disappointed that despite previously committing to effectively ban the use of electronic and other aversive training devices, a year later the Scottish Government has only issued guidance about their use.

""This means that Scotland's pets are not protected from the negative impacts of using these cruel devices.""

She said changes could be made to a dog's behaviour through positive reinforcement without the need to use the collars.

Lindsay Fyffe-Jardine, of Edinburgh Dog and Cat Home, said: ""We strongly believe that an outright ban on the use of shock collars is the only outcome that will ensure dogs are protected from the fear and misery these collars bring.""",Calls for outright ban on electric shock collars for pets in Scotland,human interest,animal,297
215692,france24,"Marty Melville, AFP | New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern speaks to the media during a press conference at the Justice Precinct in Christchurch on March 28, 2019.

Tens of thousands of New Zealand teachers walked off the job on Wednesday, a day before the government announced its ‘wellbeing’ budget, calling for higher pay and shorter hours in the country’s largest ever education strike.

Almost 50,000 secondary and primary school teachers joined the strike across New Zealand, according to their unions, closing schools around the nation.

The strike came a day before Jacinda Ardern’s government was set to release its first ‘Wellbeing’ budget, which had been touted globally as a new approach to fiscal decision-making guided by a broader range of indicators to improve New Zealanders’ living standards.

Unions working on behalf of teachers have been negotiating with the government for months for pay rises and measures to reduce workloads, but so far have ended in deadlock.

“The offers we have received from the government have not addressed the issues our profession is facing. They will not turn around the crisis in education that is looming,” said Lynda Stuart, the president of teachers’ union NZEI Te Riu Roa, in a statement when the strike was announced earlier this month.

Education Minister Chris Hipkins said earlier this month when the strikes were announced that the extra NZ$1.2 billion (€703 million) over four years in pay rises on offer was the “biggest offer teachers have had in a decade” and told Radio New Zealand on Wednesday there was no more money for teachers’ pay in this year’s budget.

The strike spotlights the difficulties Ardern’s government faces in delivering on its promise to pour money into social services and rein in economic inequality when it took office in 2017.

The centre-left government’s traditional union support base says sluggish wage growth and soaring living costs have left workers struggling, with junior doctors, nurses and court officials taking action in the past year to demand pay hikes.

The government on Tuesday said it was “hacked” following the early release of some budget information by the opposition National Party. The Finance Minister said not all the details in the information was correct.

471233,rferl,"Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystayko says the timing of a four-way summit aimed at resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine depends upon Russia.

 

 Meanwhile, Ukraine's Defense Minister Andriy Zahorodnyuk said on November 1 that Kyiv was postponing the withdrawal of its forces from the town of Petrivske, a disengagement that had been planned for November 4, because of a cease-fire violation by Russia-backed separatists that occurred there on October 30.

 

 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said on October 31 that the Petrivske disengagement would take place on November 4 provided the pro-Russia separatists there continued to respect a cease-fire agreement,

 

 The disengagement of forces near Petrivske is seen as key step ahead of a long-awaited summit that would bring together leaders from Ukraine, Russia, France, and Germany to discuss how to end the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian government forces and Russia-backed separatists.

 

 Ukrainian armed forces have been fighting the separatists in Luhansk and the neighboring Donetsk region in a conflict that has killed more than 13,000 people since April 2014.

 

 Under a deal reached earlier this month to end the five-year conflict, the sides agreed to start withdrawing from their positions near Petrivske and the town of Zolote.

 

 ""We are implementing the agreements that were reached,"" Prystayko told a press briefing in Kyiv on November 1.

 

 ""Effectively, there are two: recognizing the Steinmeier Formula as a way of solving this complicated issue, and disengagement at three sites. Today, we are close to disengaging at the last site, so in principle we will create all necessary conditions,"" Prystayko said.

 

 The Steinmeier Formula lays the groundwork for reinvigorating the larger peace deals known loosely as the Minsk Accords, and the first major international summit on the Ukraine conflict in three years.

 

 ""Currently, [the so-called Normandy-format meeting] largely depends on the Russian side,"" Prystayko said.

 

 Prystayko's statement comes after he voiced hope on October 29 that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy would meet his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, next month for peace talks mediated by the leaders of France and Germany, in what is known as the Normandy format.

 

 During a visit to Budapest on October 30, Putin said he was ready to have a meeting with the leaders of Ukraine, France, and Germany.

 

 But Putin said such a meeting ""needs to be well-prepared and produce specific results that will help the settlement.""

 

 Speaking in Kyiv on November 1, Deputy Prime Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Ukraine planned to conduct large-scale exercises in the Black Sea with NATO next year, lasting four days.

229334,globalresearch,"Jean Vanier, dead last week, was philanthropist and Christian, founder of L’Arche, a remarkable organization for developmentally disabled.  Vanier was also a philosopher who left Academia for society’s vulnerable.  I used his Becoming Human, in class after philosophy class, to explain 20th century Marxist philosopher, Che Guevara.

The connection surprises some. They don’t know Cuba’s earthy traditions. “Earthy” is the word used by Cuban philosopher, Cintio Vitier, to link early 19th century Cuban priests – reformists – to the radical vision of independence leader, José Martí, and the eventual Cuban Revolution.[i]

It has to do with feelings. More specifically, it has to do with energy arising when we do the right thing, where “right thing” is not necessarily moral but useful. It’s creative mental energy, making imaginable what was not imaginable previously. Ancients called it “faith”.

It’s confidence, not intellectual but felt, explained by laws of nature, cause and effect, mind/body connection.

When you know you’re doing what you’re supposed to do, you gain, even if your actions fail. It’s a kind of dynamic reciprocity. Earthy. Che Guevara’s “hombre nuevo” is in this line. It’s not a new being, as critics claim.  It’s people aware – in a felt, experiential sense – of shared humanity.

It’s what Vanier explained. He left a life of privilege to live with disabled folk, saying it made him more human. It was about truth, not morality. He identified a paradox: We seek community to avoid loneliness. But loneliness is the natural state of reflective human beings, aware of vulnerability.

We escape our condition through community, but loneliness, being universally shared, provides grounds for human community: between people as people. “Reality is the first principle of truth”, and the reality of human existence is insecurity. Loneliness “can only be covered over, it can never actually go away”.

His point is how to discover community. It was Guevara’s point, but it goes back further in Cuba. It was raised by priests who wanted independence from Spain, the US, the UK and slavery. It was a time when ideas from Europe persuaded young people “it’s all good”, if it feels right.

José de la Luz y Caballero, who could have been a rich lawyer, taught Philosophy because of slavery, a social cancer. Privileged progressives criticized Spanish colonialism, resisted US annexation, and decried social vices, but could not imagine living without slaves.  Slavery was an expectation.

José Antonio Saco, who preceded Luz at the institute founded by Félix Varela (1811), could not imagine abolition. Precisely because slavery was so taken for granted, consistent with opposition to almost all other wrongs, Luz dedicated himself to educating privileged youth about how to know justice when injustice is part of who you are.

Luz was a Christian, of Vanier’s sort.  He cared about truth.  He was a scientist who knew how understanding works. It depends on expectations, rooted in habit patterns. We identify with them and they must be broken, occasionally. A remarkable national debate (1836-8), the Cuban Philosophical Polemic, was about thinking. It anticipates late 20thcentury philosophy of science, in North America.

It involves loss. Vanier wrote about “brokenness”.  It is how we know the invisible, the “discarded”:

It’s also about gain. According to Vitier, the leaders of Cuba’s agonizingly long struggle for independence shared an idea: Freedom requires raising the most vulnerable. Piero Gleijeses says it’s why Cuba went to Africa in the 70s, defying the Soviets. The CIA knew it: Cuba sided with the poor and non-White. The USSR was rich and white. The division between North and South was the major fault line.[ii]

This is the “earthy” thinking that Vitier refers to: formation of people through bold, sacrificial resistance to deep-seated, dehumanizing lies.

Vanier’s brokenness defies a lie of that sort: part of the social fabric. A useful, compassionate new book on dementia, The Last Ocean,[iii] argues that the tragedy of dementia is loss of a coherent self. We spend entire lifetimes building a “vast rich palace of the self”, which falls away. US philosopher Ronald Dworkin says that without a sense of self – different from a self — suicide is rational.

Yet that “palace” is a myth. And seeking it – a sense of self as opposed to a self – is counterproductive. You seek to escape insecurity, fabricating an identity – a ‘narrative self” – and you deny in the process what is really shared: insecurity.

Guevara called it an “invisible cage” or the “bourgeois myth of the self-made man”. Patrick Modiano (Nobel Prize 2014) shows why. [iv] He tries “to impose some order on my memories. But many are missing, and most of them remain isolated.” He can’t do it, and yet the stories he wants to forget “rise to the surface like a drowned man”.

“Real encounters” are more interesting. They might “drag you in their wake when they disappear”. But they’re real, unlike the “coherent self” of memories, made of “bits of sentences spoken by anonymous voices”.

We don’t accept illness and we don’t admit death. We suffer for that. But in arguing that we are diminished by dismissing the vulnerable, The Last Ocean nonetheless maintains the myth that prevents seeing those vulnerable as people: a secure place that doesn’t exist, not just for those with dementia, but for anyone.

So argues Vanier, and Guevara, and earthy thinkers for millennia.

Some are Lazaruses. Looking them in the eye and hearing their story involves loss: of lies, unimaginable to give up, like liberalism and “development”. But there’s also gain. Vanier’s life was all about that.

758739,theindependent,"Eintracht Frankfurt host Chelsea in a Europa League semi-final first leg on Thursday night.

In the last round, Chelsea defeated Slavia Prague 5-3 over two legs, while Frankfurt knocked out Portugal’s Benfica on away goals in a scintillating 4-4 quarter-final tie.

Both Frankfurt and Chelsea are fourth-placed in their respective leagues, but neither team is in remarkable form - the Londoners have three wins in their last six matches, and the German side have only won two of their last six games.

The Europa League may therefore prove to be as good an opportunity for Champions League football next season as the clubs’ domestic ventures.

Adi Hutter’s side will be without Ante Rebic in their front line, as the Croatia international sees out the final days of a suspension. Chelsea have their own absentees in Callum Hudson-Odoi - whose Achilles injury will keep him out of the last few games of the season - and Willian.

Eintracht Frankfurt vs. Chelsea kicks off at 8pm (GMT).

The match will be shown live on BT Sport 3, with coverage beginning at 7:15pm.

Subscribers can also watch the game on BTSport.com and the broadcaster’s app.

Thursday evening’s clash will mark the first time the two clubs have played each other in official competition.

Frankfurt’s jubilation after overturning a 4-2 first leg defeat in the quarter-finals showed what the Europa League means to them, so expect the German team to be fired up for Thursday’s fixture.

Meanwhile, Chelsea are stuttering in the Premier League, but Maurizio Sarri’s side have saved some of their best performances this season for the Europa League, and they should possess enough quality to beat Frankfurt, even on foreign soil.

In any case, it will be a battle of the strikers, with Chelsea likely to field Olivier Giroud up front - the competition’s top scorer with 10 goals so far - and Frankfurt expected to utilise Serbia’s Luka Jovic, whose eight goals in the tournament mark the second highest return after Giroud.",Frankfurt vs Chelsea predicted line-up: Olivier Giroud likely to partner Eden Hazard in attack,sport,competition discipline,321

But Flaherty notes that federal science funding as a percentage of GDP has steadily decreased since the 1970s. “This trend raises questions about the nation’s ability to sustain its research leadership in areas like biomedicine and technology, particularly since federal funds play a crucial role in fueling basic science breakthroughs,” she writes.",Nearly a Third of U.S. Patents Depend on Federal Research: Study,science and technology,scientific research,117

Ernesto Valverde's side looked odds-on for a superb treble campaign as they travelled to Anfield for the second leg of their Champions League semi-final 3-0 up against Liverpool.

However, a spectacular 4-0 collapse on Merseyside has threatened to completely overshadow their LaLiga title triumph, while the Copa del Rey Final against Valencia will be of scant consolation to Barca fans - or Lionel Messi, who had made the Champions League his main target this year.

Philippe Coutinho does not appear to be part of those plans after losing the trust of both the Barca fans and board, while Ousmane Dembele's injury woes make it increasingly likely that the club will seek out additional firepower.

Frenkie de Jong has already been signed, while Atletico Madrid star Antoine Griezmann could make a different 'decision' this summer after rejecting Barca last year.

De Jong's Ajax team-mate Matthijs de Ligt could well follow him to Camp Nou, but Barca face a tricky task this summer as they seek top talent while also having to manage a huge wage bill.

The report surmised that Kaspersky Lab’s ability to catch Martin, a former NSA contractor, casts doubt on US ability to protect its own computers, especially because Martin was able to steal an estimated 50 terabytes of data from the NSA and other government agencies undetected over a two-decade period.

The theft included some of the NSA’s most sophisticated and sensitive hacking tools, which were stolen despite a scramble to upgrade computer security following leaks by another NSA contractor, Edward Snowden, three years earlier, the report explained.

Martin, who is set to go to trial in June, was arrested August 27, 2016, following a search of his home shortly after Kaspersky Lab turned its material over to the NSA. He was indicted in February 2017.

Ironically, the exposure of Martin occurred at a time when the FBI was engaged in an aggressive, behind-the-scenes campaign to discredit the company and get its software banned from US government computers on national security grounds.

One worker is understood to have a broken collarbone while others are believed to have injuries including bruised ribs.

Staff from the acute admissions unit and the intensive psychiatric care unit at Inverclyde Royal Hospital in Greenock have accused bosses of understaffing their departments.

And they claim that they have been forced to deal with patients armed with potential weapons.

Union officials believe the situation at the hospital is so serious “staff and patients are at genuine risk of serious injury or long-term damage to their health and well-being”. Union officials claim four were assaulted but the NHS insist the figure is two.

Trade union Unison is demanding NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde (NHSGGC) takes action to address a catalogue of concerns.

In a letter to CEO Jane Grant, the union said: “Attempts by local stewards to raise concerns and reach resolutions have been unsuccessful.

“Members have requested that Unison raise their concerns and call for an urgent independent task force response to ensure that staff, patients and the public are provided with a safe environment.”

The union also claim a patient brought from prison was admitted with “numerous knives and razor blades attached to his person”.

Unison’s Matt McLaughlin said: “If people are being delivered to these units equipped to cause harm then someone could be killed. I hope that doesn’t happen but it will be on the health board if it does occur.”

Labour’s health spokeswoman Monica Lennon said: “It’s shocking that little is being done to protect health workers.”

NHSGGC said: “We take very seriously any assaults or acts of violence against our staff and have a dedicated team of experts who train and support staff in techniques to reduce and manage violence.

791152,theirishtimes,"The largest dog welfare charity in Ireland has paused canine adoptions until next year in order to discourage well-meaning but ill-prepared people from getting a rescue pet this Christmas.

The Dogs Trust, which coined the phrase “a dog is for life, not just for Christmas” more than 40 years ago, has suspended its dog re-homing service from today until January 4th.

It is also bringing the curtain down on its weekly Puppy Cam until the same date, stressing that Christmas was a bad time to take on a dog, especially a puppy.

The charity highlighted the importance of dogs being provided with basic training and positive socialisation experiences in the first few months to set them up for the best start in life. It said many people, even those with the best of intentions, were simply unable to provide this at a busy time like Christmas.

Since the beginning of the year, Dogs Trust has received 2,135 calls and emails from the public seeking to surrender dogs, with 667 of these in the first three months of the year.

January continues to have the highest number of surrenders, with 189 calls and 47 emails received by the charity in the first month of this year. The main reason people gave when looking to give up a dog was that they did not have enough time to look after it.

While rehoming has been suspended, the charity’s centre in Finglas will remain open to the public over Christmas so dogs looking for homes can be visited and the rehoming process can begin with a view to adoptions in the New Year.

“Each year we are saddened and worried by the number of people looking to relinquish their dog, especially in the first few months after Christmas,” Dogs Trust executive director Becky Bristow said.

Ms Bristow expressed the hope that by spreading the message that it would remind people that “a dog is a long-term commitment and will encourage people to wait and consider adding a dog to their family in the New Year instead, when the festivities have died down”.",Dogs Trust pauses adoptions of rescue pets until after Christmas,human interest,animal,341

""The 2018 general fertility rate fell to another all-time low for the United States,"" the researchers wrote in the report, published Wednesday.

The report found that the general fertility rate dropped 2% between 2017 and 2018 among girls and women age 15 to 44 nationwide.

In 2017, the total fertility rate for the United States continued to dip below what's needed for the population to replace itself, according to a separate report published by the National Center for Health Statistics in January.

America's fertility rate and the number of births nationwide have been on the decline in recent years. A report of provisional birth data published by the National Center for Health Statistics in May showed the number of births last year dropping to its lowest level in about three decades.

Now the center's latest report presents selected highlights from that 2018 birth data. For the report, researchers examined birth certificate data from the National Vital Statistics System's Natality Data File, taking a close look at births among white, black and Hispanic women in 2018. America just had its lowest number of births in 32 years, report finds When examined by race, the data showed that fertility rates declined 2% for white and black women, and 3% for Hispanic women, between 2017 and 2018. The data also showed that the teen birth rate, for ages 15 to 19, fell 7% from 2017 to 2018. When examined by race, the data showed that teen births declined by 4% for black teenagers, and 8% for white and Hispanic teens. Also among all births, the percentage delivered at less than full term, or 39 weeks, increased -- with preterm births climbing from 9.93% of births in 2017 to 10.02% in 2018, and early-term births rising from 26% in 2017 to 26.53% in 2018. The percentages of births delivered at full-, late- and post-term declined, according to the data. Full-term births were down from 57.49% of births in 2017 to 57.24% in 2018, the data showed, and post-term births declined from 6.58% to 6.2%. Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team. Overall, a rise in preterm births might be linked with a rise in births among women in their late 30s and 40s , since a later maternal age is a risk factor, Dr. Rahul Gupta, chief medical and health officer for March of Dimes , a nonprofit focused on the health of mothers and babies, said in May . He was not involved in the new report. ""The continuing shift toward increased maternal age at first birth is something that does increase the risk. However, it does not fully explain the increase in the preterm birth rate. So that's one of the challenges here, I think, for the nation,"" he said.

The Towie star received the lowest score of the series so far and was slammed by Mr Nasty once again – which led her to hit back and start a furious on air row - and viewers quickly leapt to her defence.

One fan tweeted: "" @missgemcollins it's about time someone stood up to Jason, don't mess with the GC keep being real Gemma xx.""

Another said: ""Idk if anyone else is watching dancing on ice but one of the judges has just been such a d**** head to Gemma Collins the way he’s just spoke to her, actual disgusting and so hurtful.""

A third added: ""Well said Gemma Collins. You truly put Jason Gardiner in his low place.

""I think you put an excellent effort in and the public love to see you. Pholly were way too smug and I think bordering on bullying with their sly comments and smirks!""

Piers Morgan has also backed Gemma Collins following last night's drama.

The Good Morning Britain host, 53, accused Jason Gardiner, 47, of bodyshaming and abusing the Gemma after he said he wouldn't be expecting any lifts on the ice from her or partner Matt Evers.

He vented: ""You know what? I think they’ve been very mean to her.

""They put her on the show knowing she’s probably not going to be that great, and now they’ve been sort of taunting her and ridiculing her.

""I think she’s giving it a damn good go. I didn’t think that I’d be the Gemma Collins' defender in all this.""

In an interview with The Sun this week, Jason branded Gemma ""lazy"" and ""mediocre"" and claimed she is not working hard enough in the competition, just days after show host Holly also questioned her professionalism.

After Gemma hit back on air, Jason told her:  ""This doesn't help your cause. It shows you're just a brat. Listen to what we're saying.""

599049,thedailycaller,"Former Michigan Democratic Rep. John Dingell died Thursday, a day after his family revealed he was in hospice care.

Dingell was the longest-serving member of Congress in history, according to The Detroit News.

“It is with a heavy heart that we announce the passing of John David Dingell, Jr., former Michigan Congressman … Congressman Dingell died peacefully today at his home in Dearborn, surrounded by his wife Deborah. He was a lion of the United States Congress and a loving son, father, husband, grandfather and friend,” Democratic Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell, Dingell’s wife, said in a statement. She now represents his former district.

Dingell was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2018 and wanted to share a message with his social media followers after the hospice announcement.

“The Lovely Deborah is insisting I rest and stay off here, but after long negotiations we’ve worked out a deal where she’ll keep up with Twitter for me as I dictate the messages,” Dingell wrote on Twitter Wednesday, referencing his wife. “I want to thank you all for your incredibly kind words and prayers. You’re not done with me just yet.” (RELATED: The Hill Posts Article About Retired Congressman Who Attacked Trump, Gets Party Wrong)

The former congressman had stepped down from office in 2014 after serving since 1955. He first came to represent Michigan’s 12th Congressional District after winning a special election following the death of his father, Rep. John D. Dingell Sr, according to Ballotpedia.

He helped draft many of the nation’s important environmental and energy laws, reported The Detroit News. He was also a big supporter of the Affordable Care Act.

“Let me just say this: You ain’t seen nothing yet. My dad was one of the authors of Social Security, [and] worked a long time to get it through. We finally, under your leadership, Madame Leader [Nancy Pelosi], we got the Affordable Care Act,” Dingell said in March 2013.

Politico health care reporter Dan Diamond predicted his influence would outlast him through the progressive left’s push for Medicare for all.

“Dingell was one of the key architects — for nearly 60 years in the House! — in the movement that’s become Medicare-for-All,” Diamond wrote Wednesday after news broke that Dingell had entered hospice care.

Dingell was not a fan of President Donald Trump, having called on him to resign in August 2017.

652295,thedailyrecord,"A Bridge of Allan pensioner has lost nearly seven stone over the last year by taking part in fitness classes and watching what he eats.

Retired seed technologist Ron Don (68) currently has to lose two further stones to reach his target weight of 10 stone 6Ibs.

For more than 20 years Ron had high blood pressure, but following an annual assessment at Bridge of Allan’s hypertension clinic in June 2018 his GP Niamh Mullins expressed concern with him putting on a stone in weight over the previous year.

Ron, of Cornton Road, however agreed to be referred to the Fit4Life class at Stirling’s Peak Sports Village and he attended his first appointment the following month.

He also changed his diet cutting down on carbohydrates like bread, pasta, pastries and biscuits.

His job had involved travelling and staying in hotels with food and drink laid on. But taking on the Peak fitness classes, he explained, was a turning point.

Ron said: “The GP referral scheme at the Peak gave me the kick-start I needed. I had never been in a gym before and never taken part in organised exercise since my school days more than 50 years ago. Since July last year I have become a gym regular.

“At first I thought it was going to kill me, especially the spin classes, but they demonstrated how unfit I was and convinced me of the need to improve.”

He now grows his own vegetables on an allotment in Bridge of Allan and most days attends the Peak for either the gym or fitness classes.

Ron added: “After a year of attending the Peak, I have plucked up the courage recently to attend cardio dance, yoga and body balance classes.

“This would have been inconceivable earlier in my weight loss journey as I was so self-conscious about my lack of co-ordination, flexibility and weight.”

743435,theindependent,"The director of the British Museum has appeared to rule out returning the Elgin Marbles to Greece after its government demanded Britain open negotiations over their return last year.

The 2,500-year-old marble sculptures were removed from the Parthenon Temple on the Acropolis in Athens by the Ottoman ambassador Lord Elgin in the early 1800s.

Lord Elgin sold the marbles to the British government, who passed them on to the British Museum in 1817 where they remain one of its most prized exhibits.

Debate over where the sculptures should be located has raged for more than 200 years, with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn pledging to return them to Greece if he becomes prime minister.

In August, Greek culture minister Lydia Koniordou invited UK officials to meetings in Greece to discuss the statues’ return in the midst of Brexit talks as Britain sought allies around Europe.

In an interview with Ta Nea, Greece’s daily newspaper, British Museum director Hartwig Fischer said: “The Trustees of the British Museum feel the obligation to preserve the collection in its entirety, so that things that are part of this collection remain part of this collection.”

Asked if he thinks the Greek people are right to want the Parthenon sculptures back, he told the newspaper: “I can certainly understand that the Greeks have a special and passionate relationship with this part of their cultural heritage.

“Yes, I understand that there is a desire to see all of the Parthenon Sculptures in Athens.”

The other half of the Parthenon Sculptures are currently in the Acropolis Museum in Greece.

For several decades, Greece has called for the reunification of the statues and has sent several formal requests, threatened legal action and proposed solutions such as mediation by Unesco.

Supporters of the Greek position say although Lord Elgin said he had the permission of officials of the ruling Ottoman Empire to take the sculptures, the empire was a foreign force and had no right to let the artefacts go.

When Mr Fischer was asked about Mr Corbyn’s pledge to return the Elgin Marbles to Greece if he became prime minister, he said: “I think that this is Mr Corbyn’s personal view on the question, that you take note of.

“Obviously, that is not the stance and the view of the Trustees of the Museum.”

Asked by Ta Nea if he would accept that Greece is the legal owner of the Parthenon Sculptures, he replied: “No, I would not. The objects that are part of the collection of the British Museum are in the fiduciary ownership of the Trustees of the Museum.”

Defenders of keeping the statues in Britain have argued returning them would pave the way for requests from other coutries for items in British museums to be returned.

In a statement, the British Museum said: “Hartwig Fischer was stating the long-standing position of the British Museum. We believe there is a great public benefit in being able to see these wonderful objects in the context of a world collection.

“The museum lends extensively across the world, and some loans are long-term but not indefinite.”

Polling by YouGov conducted in 2017 suggested the British public mostly back the marbles’ return, with 55 per cent saying the statues should go back to Greece and 21 per cent saying they should remain in Britain.",British Museum &apos;rules out&apos; returning Elgin Marbles to Greece after country demands UK opens negotiations,"arts, culture, entertainment and media",culture,526
754569,theindependent,"Velvet is fast becoming something of a trans-seasonal fabric choice in interior schemes all over the world. From hotels and bars to the most Pin-able of living rooms and bedrooms, velvet has scalloped, pleated and dimpled its way onto our feeds and into our homes. From upholstery to curtains and carpets; the trend is here to stay.

One of the most prominent ways we are introducing velvet into our interior schemes is via upholstery on armchairs and sofas. Sofa Workshop, a leading sofa retailer, has reported a 58 per cent increase in searches for velvet sofas year on year, while online furniture retailer, Wayfair.co.uk, has quoted a staggering 500 per cent year on year increase.

However, velvet sofas may not have the monopoly on the market, as the site has also seen a spike in searches for “velvet wallpaper”, which is up over 1000 per cent year on year. Heritage carpet manufacturer, Brintons, has also revealed that velvet-style carpets are enjoying an increase in sales. Nadia McGowan Hill, Wayfair.co.uk’s resident style advisor, believes this is indicative of a growing confidence in the material, “proving that this trend is being creatively adapted into home improvements and decor, as well as furniture.”

But it’s not just a creative confidence in the fabric that's fuelling its popularity, as Kelling Design/KDLoves’s founder and creative director Emma Deterding tells me. “There are so many bombproof varieties of velvets available today. You can be as daring as you like, without the fear of spills, stains, wear and tear. Velvets are now just as life-proof as any other fabric on the market.”

Shelby Pearson-Hendry, visual merchandise and photography manager at Sofology, agrees and believes the variety available in top retailers today is also driving the market. “The popularity of velvet continues, not only because of the luxury and richness that it offers, but also because of the wealth of choice in terms of finishes. From crushed and matte velvet all the way through to deep pile, with interwoven pattern, this sumptuous fabric is both liveable and indulgent.”

Helen Bygraves, co-founder of London and Surrey-based design studio, Hill House Interiors, points out that due to the variety available, velvet “lends itself well to both minimalist and maximalist designs"", meaning its popularity reaches across two of the key schools of aesthetics in interiors. For example, Ikea, known for its classically Swedish and minimalist designs, has launched a series of velvet pieces including the Fasalt Swivel armchair in a glorious mustard that works just as well in maximalist schemes. Ella James has also created beautiful new season photography that demonstrates the use of decadent velvet cushions in pared-back, Scandi settings.

So, whether you’re ready to go full throttle with a carpet or sofa, or if a scatter cushion or two is your limit, embrace velvet this spring and beyond.","When it comes to interior design, velvet is taking over",lifestyle and leisure,lifestyle,452
2488,abcnews,"The head of Somalia’s electoral commission told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that 2020 is “a pivotal year” for the country whose citizens have been denied the right to political participation for 50 years and are hoping for an election with universal voting.

Halima Ismail Ibrahim said the country’s political leaders must follow through on agreements since 2011 to holding a one-person, one-vote election as a replacement for “clan-based power-sharing.” In presidential elections most recently in 2017, lawmakers were chosen by about 14,000 clan delegates and they in turn elected a president.

Ibrahim urged Somali leaders to treat one-person, one-vote elections in 2020-2021 “as a constitutional obligation and a national priority and provide the necessary political and financial support” for the National Independent Electoral Commission which she chairs to conduct an election with universal voting next year.

Since Somalia became an independent nation in 1960, she said, “universal suffrage elections have only been conducted twice, 1964 and 1969.”

Later that year, a coup brought military leader Siad Barre to power. After three decades of civil war, extremist attacks and famine, Somalia established a functioning transitional government in 2012 and has been working to rebuild stability.

But U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said the government must still tackle violent extremism, terrorism, armed conflict, political instability and corruption.

James Swan, the U.N. envoy for Somalia, told the Security Council that “political dynamics” in the country are increasingly focusing on the 2020 election and the federal government has committed to adopting an amended federal constitution by June 2020, but significant challenges remain.

First and foremost, he pointed to the lack of “effective cooperation” between the central government and states for more than a year, which has become “an obstacle to achieving important national priorities.”

“Somalia’s leaders must act urgently to break this stalemate between the central and the federal member states in the interest of the nation,” Swan said.

He also urged parliament to approve the electoral code and amendments to the law on political parties in December, warning that any delay “puts the 2020 electoral calendar at risk.”

Somalia’s U.N. Ambassador Abukar Dahir Osman told the council the government is continuing to make preparations to hold one-person, one-vote elections in the last quarter of 2020. And it has made a commitment to pass the electoral law by the end of December and to conclude the review of the constitution by June 2020, he said.

Osman said President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed’s meeting Wednesday with two former presidents “sends a strong signal of Somalia’s commitment to ... truly historic, democratic elections next year.”

He said the government recognizes it will not meet its goals and reform agenda without the cooperation and engagement of member states — but this requires “genuine reconciliation efforts and holding fair, transparent and inclusive elections” in the states.

“Where electoral process does not meet those criteria, the federal government will not recognize the outcomes and so should our partners,” he said.

U.N. envoy Swan stressed that “insecurity remains a major challenge to progress in Somalia” because al-Qaida linked al-Shabab militants continue “to execute deadly terrorist attacks against civilians as well as military targets.”",Somali official: 2020 could see first election in 50 years,politics,election,510
788291,theirishtimes,"A Co Limerick-based student has become only the second person to win a silver medal for Ireland at the world’s most prestigious second-level mathematics competition.

Lucas Bachmann (19), a 6th year student at Glenstal Abbey in Co Limerick, was one of 621 contestants from 112 countries who competed in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) in Bath, England.

The annual competition attracts the brightest mathematical brains on the planet. It is regarded as a source of national prestige in Asia in particular, with China, South Korea, North Korea and Thailand prominent among the countries participating.

Mr Bachmann was part of the six-person Irish team selected after sitting two mathematical papers at home. He was born and brought up in Switzerland and then lived in China before his family relocated to Ireland for work purposes four years ago.

He previously won a bronze medal at the competition and hoped to win gold this time around, but was stumped by question about positive integers.

“It was one of those simple questions that had a trick to it in order to solve it. Now I know the trick,” he said. “Everything I have done over the last four years has truly cemented me in participating in this. Computer science had been my favourite subject. That was not a subject I was offered at school in Ireland. Mathematics took over for me then.”

In the three weeks leading up to the Olympiad, he did mathematics training camps with the other Irish participants.

“I would say that it is not something that any ordinary student could come in and ace. You need a lot of preparation to even understand the questions.”

Having now studied in three countries, Mr Bachmann says maths in Irish schools is too easy and involves “remembering all the information before exams and then spitting it out”. He said this was not in keeping with the analytical thinking needed to take part in the Olympiad.

The only previous time a student from Ireland gained a silver medal at the Olympiad was Fiachra Knox in 2005. Ireland has participated since 1988.

Laura Cosgrave from Midleton College in Co Cork and Tianyiwa Xie from Alexandra College in Dublin received honourable mentions for their efforts at the competition in Bath.

Three members of the Irish team were born in China, meaning four of the six participants began their mathematical education abroad.

Ireland finished 71st out of 112 countries, an improvement on past performances.

Dr Bernd Kreussler, of Mary Immaculate College in Limerick, who runs the Irish Olympiad, said the predominence of foreign-born students participating for Ireland in recent years reflects on how maths is taught in Irish schools.

“Students who have had their basic education in a school in other countries are much better in dealing with these kind of problems,” he explained.

“In standard school book situation when you are given a problem, you know exactly what to do. You have to be very creative to solve the problems in the Olympiad. This is obviously not something we are well trained at in Ireland.”",Limerick-based student wins silver at International Mathematical Olympiad,science and technology,mathematics,494

A U.S. delegation met with Chinese negotiators in Beijing on Wednesday as the world's two largest economies try to hammer out details of an agreement. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will travel to Washington for talks next week.

Washington and Beijing have pushed to resolve a trade dispute that led to a series of tariffs and raised fears about spiraling economic damage. While both sides have repeatedly touted progress in the talks, disputes such as whether to immediately remove existing tariffs or keep them in place as an enforcement measure to stop practices such as intellectual property theft have derailed a final deal. President Donald Trump also wants China to buy more U.S. goods to reduce the trade deficit between the countries.

On Wednesday, the White House said the latest talks moved Washington and Beijing closer to an agreement.

307492,mediamattersforamerica,"Gillette was probably hoping for a little bit of buzz when it released its Super Bowl ad a few weeks early. What it got was wall-to-wall coverage -- at least on Fox News.

Titled “We Believe: The Best Men Can Be,” Gillette’s video begins with a play on its long-time slogan, asking, “Is this the best a man can get? Is it?” The video then cuts to scenes touching on bullying, the #MeToo movement, and behavior that people often justify by saying “Boys will be boys.” It’s provocative, and deliberately so. The core message is that men should be their best selves and set a good example for future generations because, as the ad concludes, “the boys watching today will be the men of tomorrow.”

Fox News, as expected, didn’t take kindly to it, and the network put its outrage machine to work in response.

During the January 15 edition of The Five, co-host Greg Gutfeld said the ad “bashed men, men who fought wars, who built bridges -- they just bashed them.” Fox host Brian Kilmeade appeared on Fox Business’ Varney & Co. to say that, sure, there may be times boys will “show an aggression,” but “that’s just the way men are made up to be.” Even so, he continued, he doesn’t need a razor company telling him how to live his life.

On that morning’s episode of Fox & Friends, guest Darrin Porcher said the ad represented “an atrocity,” adding, “We should be seen as equal to women, not as beneath.” Overall, the show devoted 12 minutes of discussion time to the Gillette ad while providing just 30 seconds for the House of Representatives’ decision the night before to strip Rep. Steve King (R-IA) of his committee assignments after he made comments in support of white supremacy. That’s 24 times more coverage for the razor ad than for an objectively huge story within the world of politics.

The next day, The Daily Wire’s Matt Walsh appeared on Fox & Friends to denounce the ad as “clearly insulting,” saying, “I didn't learn anything from the #MeToo movement.” The last bit is not so surprising, as he’s already written articles and published videos on why the movement has “overstayed its welcome.”

While segments about a war on masculinity do appear to have increased in frequency in recent years, at least at first glance, the theme is not exactly new. It’s a catch-all designed to give a sense of urgency and create a personal investment between viewers and issues they otherwise might not feel motivated to act on. And there’s actually a fair amount of social science explaining why this sort of laser-focus on masculinity is a politically savvy move for a politically motivated media outlet.

“Men have been emasculated, they have been feminized by the left that has pushed us on a culture, and they do see Donald Trump as someone who speaks for them,” said then-Fox host Andrea Tantaros during the December 22, 2015, edition of Fox News’ The O’Reilly Factor. A year earlier on the same program, she claimed that “young men … have been completely feminized,” leading to educated women “having the government subsidize their sex lives.” Months before that, she warned that the left “would love to feminize” the NFL, adding, “The White House has been weighing in on the NFL on concussions and other issues.”

In October 2015, when Playboy made the decision to no longer publish nude photos, T.J. McCormack penned for FoxNews.com something of a requiem for the magazine and America’s collective masculinity:

In response to a May 2017 article in Vox about the U.S. Marine Corps’ inaction over a revenge porn scandal among its ranks, Fox host Todd Starnes took a jab at “the emasculated pajama boys” who “seem to want our Marines to prance into battle wearing high heels and camouflage rompers.”

The report came as a set of guidelines designed to help psychologists work more effectively with men and boys. Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce appeared on the January 10 edition of Fox & Friends to decry the APA’s findings and recommendations, mounting a defense of masculinity as a force for good:

The way Bruce and others on Fox described the guidelines, you’d think the APA had republished Valerie Solanas’ SCUM Manifesto and was calling for elimination of the male sex. The guidelines weren’t created to blame men or masculinity, but to help men and boys by giving psychologists the same kind of specialized tools for working with them that APA provided for working with women and girls in 2007. The guidelines aren’t anti-masculinity, either. In fact, just a quick look shows that their aim is to help men embrace their masculine traits in healthy and appropriate ways and develop a deeper understanding of themselves.

In fact, during the January 3 edition of Tucker Carlson Tonight, host Tucker Carlson pointed to the male suicide rate in America as a problem that must be specifically addressed. Carlson suggested that the one solution is to promote marriage, while his guest, the Manhattan Institute’s Heather MacDonald, stressed the “need to valorize males,” citing the “uniquely male” characteristics of “valor, courage, chivalry, heroism in war.”

Male suicide is one of the primary issues the APA’s guidelines aims to address (emphasis added):

On the January 8 edition of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson and guest Christina Hoff Sommers discussed the APA guidelines, with Carlson lamenting that the report concluded that “the problem with men is their maleness,” adding, “Newly issued guidelines argue that ‘traditional masculinity’ is harmful and that psychologists should somehow undermine it.” It should be noted that this isn’t what the guidelines actually suggest.

So Fox News is upset that nobody wants to address challenges that disproportionately affect men, but when a professional organization invests 13 years in developing guidelines designed to address those issues, that is also … bad. It’s almost as though commentators like Carlson and Bruce are more interested in using these problems as talking points than in actually finding solutions.

Throughout March 2018 -- Women’s History Month -- Carlson used his massive platform at Fox to shine a light on the supposed plight of American men. In many of these shows, he could be found parroting the talking points of YouTube misogynists such as Gavin McInnes, Paul Joseph Watson, and Stefan Molyneux, and playing host to the likes of Jordan Peterson.

“The patriarchy is gone: Women are winning; men are failing,” he said during a March 28 episode. Two weeks earlier, he had argued that undocumented immigrants cause lower wages, which in turn reduce “the attractiveness of men as potential spouses, thus reducing fertility and especially marriage rates.” A week before that, he delivered a monologue about how “something ominous is happening to men in America. Everyone who pays attention knows that.”

The theme has carried on to more recent months, as well. During the October 11 edition of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson warned that Democrats were waging war on the very concept of fatherhood:

During the show’s August 23 episode, Carlson defended a video from conservative commentator Allie Stuckey that Facebook had temporarily removed and which stoked fears that “the current trend is to feminize young men in the hopes of achieving some Utopia notion of equality and peace. It's not masculinity that is toxic. It is the lack of it.”

Why is Fox News so obsessed with the idea that masculinity is under attack? The concept may have its roots in beliefs about what it means to be a man. There’s a theory in psychology -- the precarious manhood theory -- that our society views men’s status as something to be earned -- and something that can be easily lost. To oversimplify it a bit, it’s the theory that men view their maleness as though a “man card” were a real thing that could be revoked for not meeting social expectations of masculinity. In turn, the fear of losing status prompts men to make public displays of masculinity and rejection of what they perceive as feminine.

A 2015 study published in the journal Social Psychology explored what happens when men feel their masculinity is under threat.  The article looked at threats to masculinity as political motivators, theorizing that perceived threats would inspire “men's efforts to reestablish their power over women via the promotion of ideologies that implicitly subordinate women.”

The authors found that “men’s power over women is a key aspect of men’s masculinity” and that threats to masculinity “led to greater public discomfort, anger, and ideological dominance” among those studied. That anger “predicted greater endorsement of ideologies that implicitly promote men’s power over women.”

Something called social dominance theory offers an explanation for how people justify hierarchies and inequality within a society. For much of history, men held virtually all power in government and business -- a patriarchy. In just the past hundred years or so, women emerged from their position as second-class citizens and demanded equal rights and treatment. While most men likely understand that there’s no good excuse to oppose equality between men and women, social dominance theory gets at how those with the most to lose -- men, in this instance -- might subconsciously try to preserve the status quo while convincing themselves that they treat all people equally.

Through what are called “legitimizing myths,” people in positions of power can convince themselves that there aren’t any structural barriers to success, that the playing field is already level. For instance, some could justify the dearth of women in positions of power in government and business by saying that maybe women are simply too emotional to lead, that perhaps men just happen to be the ones best suited for a specific position.

To point out that a playing field isn’t already level or promote institutional change is to threaten the existing hierarchies of society. Some people respond to these threats by gravitating to political ideologies associated with the preservation of existing social norms. In other words: conservatism. Fear and anger are a powerful political motivators, and Fox News knows how to bring those emotions out: by creating the appearance of a threat.

It’s not a huge stretch to see how the success of women in comparison to men can function as a threat to masculinity in itself. If, for instance, a media outlet wanted to sway voters toward candidates who embody certain identities -- white, male, and Christian, for example -- one of the most obvious things it could do is bombard the public with the idea that those very identities are under attack. If an outlet wanted to sway people from voting for a woman, or for a candidate running on pledges to upend the current system of male social dominance, it would regularly promote stories that evoke a type of existential threat to manhood. This is what Fox News does.

Candidates themselves might try to adopt a more masculine public image -- Donald Trump did this often, once donning a hard hat to promote his support for coal miners, bragging about the size of his hands (and, indirectly, his penis) during a debate, and making frequent claims that his female opponent simply didn’t have the “stamina” to be president. But it is the news media that shapes the underlying narrative. It’s for exactly this reason that things aimed at helping men and promoting healthy masculinity -- such as the APA guidelines or the Gillette ad -- are twisted into attacks on male identity.",The social science explaining why Fox News wants you to believe masculinity is under threat,science and technology,social sciences,1882
3640,abcnews,"(RNS) — On a Sunday morning in May of 1969, as clergy processed into the sanctuary of New York’s august Riverside Church, civil rights activist James Forman vaulted into the pulpit to demand $500 million in reparations for the mistreatment of African Americans from white churches and synagogues.

At the time, Forman’s interruption represented the high point for the reparations movement. A week before, Forman had debuted a radical proposal for racial justice known as “the Black Manifesto” for 500 black activists gathered in Detroit for the National Black Economic Development Conference.

“(W)e know that the churches and synagogues have a tremendous wealth,” the manifesto stated, “and its membership, white America, has profited and still exploits black people.

”The conference determined, by a 187-63 vote, that it was time for white Christians and Jews to pay reparations and demonstrate a willingness to fight “the white supremacy and racism which has forced us as black people to make these demands.

”Riverside, then a mostly white liberal Protestant congregation whose neo-Gothic landmark building was financed by John D. Rockefeller Jr., would be deeply divided over the next few years over Forman’s challenge. As the activist brought his manifesto to other congregations and denominations, Riverside established a lecture series and a “Fund for Social Justice” that aimed to raise $450,000 over three years to help the poor in the local community. It fell short of the goal by almost $100,000.

The Black Manifesto’s demands never caught fire in the broader U.S. religious community. The Rev. Gayraud Wilmore, a black Presbyterian leader in New York City in 1969, recalled 50 years later how religious institutions responded.

“I saw them withering and unable to step forward and say ‘Let’s be the church,’” said Wilmore, now 98. “I saw no bold action taken on our side to go along with the bold action Forman was taking.

”Five decades later, the reparations debate has reentered the national spotlight, with some religious institutions leading the way.

Earlier in December, Reform Jews, declaring that “racial inequity is present in virtually every aspect of American life,” voted overwhelmingly to support a U.S. commission to develop proposals for reparations and urged conversations in their congregations to redress systemic racism.

In recent months, Virginia Theological Seminary, Princeton Theological Seminary and Georgetown University have all announced plans to fund initiatives that would benefit the descendants of slaves, while Episcopal dioceses in New York and Long Island made million- and half-million-dollar commitments as reparations committees continued their work.

In May, the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland voted to study reparations and urge congregations to “examine how their endowed wealth is tied to the institution of slavery.

”Maryland’s African American bishop, Eugene Taylor Sutton, said tears came to his eyes when the measure passed at the diocese’s general convention with no dissenting votes, and he realized that the assembled delegates, representing a membership that is 90% white, “got it.”

“They get this thing called justice, and when you put it in a frame that there is a basic injustice in this nation of stealing from generations of people and that has a direct effect on today, then people,” Sutton said, “they say, 'OK, we got to get that fixed.’

”Sutton, who testified before Congress in June with writer Ta-Nehisi Coates to advocate for the idea of a U.S. reparations commission, emphasized that reparations can come in many forms. Starting next month, members of his diocese will begin to consider options such as providing better access for people of color to home buying, job training and faculty positions at seminaries.

It has taken some American religious institutions 50 years to get their heads around reparations. When Forman hijacked that Sunday morning service, two-thirds of Riverside worshippers, including the minister, stormed out in protest. After activists occupied offices in the Interchurch Center of New York, a court issued restraining orders to bar Forman from the building. In Missouri, manifesto supporters in St. Louis carried out a series of “Black Sunday” protests, interrupting local services, which led to confrontations with white church members and arrests.

The manifesto was quite specific in its demands. Black activists would control the distribution of reparations. The $500 million (soon increased to $3 billion) would be spent on programs designed to ensure black self-determination. These included establishing a Southern land bank, publishing industries, television networks, job training centers, labor unions and a black university.

The manifesto’s rhetoric was just as controversial. Written by Forman, a former member of the civil rights group known as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the preamble framed reparations in Marxist terms. “Time is short,” Forman wrote. “(N)o oppressed people ever gained their liberation until they were ready to fight, to use whatever means necessary, including the use of force and power of the gun to bring down the colonizer.

”Prominent black and white religious leaders diverged on how to interpret Forman’s call for revolution. The Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy, who succeeded the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, compared Forman to biblical prophets who spoke truth to power. Writing in The Christian Century, he asked, “Was there not even a physical resemblance between Amos, the dusty-road-weary prophet in his desert garb, and Jim Forman in his dashiki?”

The response from some white denominations was outright rejection. The Southern Baptist Convention dismissed the manifesto as “outrageous.” The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York called it un-American and touted its own programs for the “needy and disadvantaged” instead.

The American Jewish Committee, which as part of the Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization had helped organize the National Black Economic Development Conference, withdrew from the IFCO. Rabbi Marc H. Tanenbaum, IFCO’s first president, resigned, stating hecould not “in conscience stand by in silence and appear ... to give assent to the revolutionary ideology and racist rhetoric of the Black Manifesto.

”Other denominations were more ambivalent. The Reformed Church in America invited Forman to address its general synod after he occupied the denomination’s headquarters a month after his action at Riverside. The Rev. Rand Peabody, a 22-year-old white seminarian who had already been slated to give the sermon the next day, revised his sermon after hearing news of Forman’s “liberation” of the RCA’s offices.

“I remember I said it’s not a time for us to feel either blamed or shamed and certainly not a time to feel futile,” Peabody, now 73, said in an interview. “Our denomination, in his eye, did indeed have the power to play a part and we should accept that as almost a commissioning of the denomination to indeed step up to the plate and get involved in more focused and proactive ways.

”Like other denominations, the RCA didn’t accede to Forman’s demand that reparations be handed over freely. Instead the synod voted to create a $100,000 fund “to be disbursed according to the decisions” of a newly formed Black Council. The council then rejected the money.“We just basically wanted to be at the table where decisions are being made and not considered an auxiliary or an offshoot or a secondhand portion of the denomination,” said the Rev. Dwayne Jackson, a Hackensack, New Jersey, pastor, who was a panelist at an RCA event commemorating the manifesto in October titled “Unfinished Business.”

Jackson, who knew some members of the council from his childhood church in the Bronx, said the staffer hired to oversee the council was the church’s first black executive. (Today, people of color comprise a third of the RCA’s executive leadership team.)

Other denominations acknowledged the grievances raised by the manifesto but rejected the solutions it proposed and even the language of “reparations.” Instead they created or continued programs aimed at helping poor blacks and others. The Presbyterian Committee on the Self-Development of People, the Evangelical Covenant Church’s Fund for Disadvantaged Americans of Minority Groups and the Episcopal Church’s General Convention Special Program were all created around the time of Forman’s action.

Dominique DuBois Gilliard, the current director of the ECC’s “racial righteousness and reconciliation” ministry, recently reflected on how this kind of response “enacted a very problematic erasure of the black freedom struggle.”

Met with the manifesto’s demands, “the Covenant found it more palatable to shift the conversation to marginalization in general,” Gilliard writes in the May/August edition of its Covenant Quarterly, which focused on the 50th anniversary of the manifesto. “This response has strong parallels to proclamations that ‘All Lives Matter’ in response to the declaration ‘Black Lives Matter.’""

There has been a shift in recent years, however, which Gilliard has helped encourage. The ECC Resolution on Racism, passed in June, insists that “the time is right for white clergy to attend to the sins of our own community and make a public commitment to prioritize antiracism work within our ministerium.”

Nell Gibson, a member and former chair of the Episcopal Diocese of New York’s Reparations Committee, recalled that in the wake of Forman’s declaration — which resulted in the Episcopal Church’s $200,000 donation to the National Committee of Black Churchmen — members of her Manhattan church created a Black and Brown Caucus. After receiving the $30,000 they demanded from their St. Mark’s Church-in-the-Bowery, they developed a free breakfast program for children, a summer “liberation school” that taught minority children their ancestors’ history and a prison law library.

Fifty years on, reparations are often framed as spiritual tests as much as financial ones. This year was named the “Year of Apology” for the Episcopal Diocese of New York, and each Sunday Gibson’s congregation has said a prayer that includes this sentence: “For the many ways — social, economic and political — that white supremacy has accrued benefits to some of us at the expense of others, we repent.”

Soon, the diocesan reparations committee will consider a number of possible next steps, such as a truth and reconciliation commission or education and health care initiatives.

Likewise, Sutton said his Maryland Episcopal diocese is moving methodically after years of conversation about reparations to figuring out how that will be lived out financially and otherwise.

“We don’t have all the solutions, we don’t know everything that’s going to fix the problem and so we’re going to be humble in even what we think we can accomplish,” he said. “But, by God, we’re going to do something.

It is the third EU fine for the search and advertising giant in two years.

The case accuses Google of abusing its market dominance by restricting third-party rivals from displaying search ads between 2006 and 2016.

In response, Google changed its AdSense contracts with large third parties, giving them more leeway to display competing search ads.

Google owner Alphabet makes large amounts of money from advertising - pre-tax profits reached $30.7bn (£23bn) in 2018, up from $12.66bn in 2017.

""Google has cemented its dominance in online search adverts and shielded itself from competitive pressure by imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites.

""This is illegal under EU anti-trust rules,"" said EC commissioner Margrethe Vestager.

Google's global affairs head, Kent Walker, said: ""We've always agreed that healthy, thriving markets are in everyone's interest.

""We've already made a wide range of changes to our products to address the Commission's concerns.

""Over the next few months, we'll be making further updates to give more visibility to rivals in Europe.""

Last year, the EU competition authority hit Google with a record €4.34bn fine for using its popular Android mobile operating system to block rivals.

This followed a €2.42bn fine in 2017 for hindering rivals of shopping comparison websites.

The European Commission said that websites often had an embedded search function.

When a consumer uses this, the website delivers both search results and search adverts, which appear alongside the search result.

Google's ""AdSense for search"" product delivers those adverts for website publishers.

The Commission described Google as acting like ""an intermediary, like an advertising broker"".

In 2006, Google started to include ""exclusivity clauses"" in contracts which stopped publishers from placing ads from Google rivals such as Microsoft and Yahoo on search pages, the Commission said.

From 2009, Google started replacing the exclusivity clauses with ""premium placement"" clauses, which meant publishers had to keep the most profitable space on their search results pages for Google's adverts and they had to request a minimum number of Google adverts.

Publishers also needed to get written permission from Google before making any changes to how rival ads were displayed, letting Google control ""how attractive, and therefore clicked on, competing search adverts could be"", the Commission said.

The restrictive clauses ""led to a vicious circle"", Ms Vestager said in a media conference.

""Google's rivals, they were unable to grow, and to compete, and as a result of that, website owners had limited options for selling advertising space on those websites, and were forced solely to rely on Google,"" she said.

""There was no reason for Google to include these restrictive clauses in their contracts, except to keep rivals out of the market,"" she added.

Between 2006 to 2016, Google had more than 70% of the search intermediation market in the EU. It generally had more than 90% of the search market and more than 75% of the online search advertising market, the Commission added.",Google hit with €1.5bn fine from EU over advertising,politics,non-governmental organisation,480

In fact, there’s nothing much to suggest how a sleepy fishing town in Jutland, Northern Denmark, got such a tropical nickname — unless you know your waves.

Klitmøller’s reef break reminded intrepid Danish surfers of the waves in the balmy birthplace of their sport. The weather, less so. Hence, Cold Hawaii.

Taking full advantage of the waves is Westwind, a surf school and shop staffed by absurdly chiselled, sun-tanned, blonde instructors.

I’m paired up with Kristine. A confident teacher who speaks perfect English, she helps me catch a few waves, while I whine about feeling seasick in the choppy conditions.

My home for the weekend is Niels Juel, a thatched-roofed fish restaurant and B&B with panoramic sea views and a wood-burning hot tub, run by Jesper and Helle Birch.

“The Cold Hawaii thing is a bit of fun but Klitmøller is Klitmøller not Hawaii. Even the waves aren’t that similar. But the area has its own charms,” says Jesper whose only nod to the Pacific is a car dashboard hula girl and lei necklace behind the bar.

After a mouthwatering seafood platter, Jesper, a friendly face with an easy laugh, cracks open the homemade herbal akvavit.

Birch For Homesickness or Hawthorn For Seasickness — I go for an extra measure of the latter.

Helle hands me some books on the area and one hardback catches my eye. Below the title ‘Thylejren’ in rainbow font stands a but-naked bloke chatting to a man dressed as a sailor.

Turns out surfing wasn’t the first countercultural wave to reach these shores. “You don’t know Thylejren?” Jesper asks. “It’s a nearby hippie commune.”

Thylejren was founded in 1970 by revellers at a music festival who had such a great time that they decided not to leave.

Half a century later and they’re still there.

It’s a half hour cab ride from Niels Juel to the camp. But in Cold Hawaii you don’t Uber, you Book a Biker. Next morning, bang on midday my ride arrives - a mean-looking motorcyclist on a Harley.

But this long-haired hard-man is no Hells Angel, Harald la Cour, is the vice- principal at Klitmøller High School.

In his spare time the 57-year-old runs Book a Biker, taking tourists on motorcycle rides and tours.

Rolling past the dunes and heaths of Thy National Park we pull up in a small clearing in the woods.

Kristian, a social worker, shows me around the camp.

Visitors are welcome for a drink in their bar-cum-meeting hall but he recommends they don’t treat the locals like an Instagram attraction.

The 65-people commune has no cars, acres of outdoor space and homes built from recycled and eco-friendly materials.

Kristian’s handmade house is a hodgepodge of reclaimed wood and windows, where he lives with his pregnant wife and young son.

He won’t let me leave without a small bag of organic “greens”, grown right there in his garden.

My final evening is spent in the market town of Thisted for what must be the world’s most hygge (cosy) music festival.

Organised by a small group of volunteers, Alive Festival is held every August in a small park, with three stages connected by paths lit with fairy lights.

There are comfy seating nooks in which to unwind and vegan burgers and ice cream on the menu.

The artists, especially up and coming London/Copenhagen singer Iris Gold, were unreal.

The locals were so warm I felt I’d made friends with the entire town. Yet despite my best efforts I couldn’t persuade a soul to stay put and set up a hippie camp.

The makeup also includes the first Native American congresswoman and the first two Muslim women to be elected to the Congress.

Detroit Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib was to be sworn in to Congress using Thomas Jefferson’s copy of the Koran, which created quite a stir among conservative Christians. Conservative pastor and radio commentator E.W. Jackson expressed his rage that a Muslim woman was going to be serving in Congress.

‘The floor of Congress is now going to look like an Islamic republic. We are a Judeo-Christian country. We are a nation rooted and grounded in Christianity and that’s that. And anybody that doesn’t like that, go live somewhere else. It’s very simple. Just go live somewhere else. Don’t try to change our country into some sort of Islamic republic or try to base our country on Sharia law.’

According to The Detroit Free Press:

‘Tlaib, a Detroit Democrat who was elected to the seat formerly held by U.S. Rep. John Conyers, said she’s unfazed by comments such as Jackson’s and expects that the objections will extend well beyond her being sworn into office the first week of January, even though she says she’s far more concerned with economic and environmental help for her constituents than pushing any religious agenda.’

Tlaib finally decided she wanted to use her own copy of the Koran, saying:

‘The Detroit Free Press had earlier reported on Tlaib considering using the Jefferson text, a 1734 translation of the Koran into English that resides in the Library of Congress. But Tlaib said her earlier decision was never meant to be final and that she changed her mind some time ago.’

Considering the use the Jefferson’s Koran though, she remarked:

‘It’s important to me because a lot of Americans have this kind of feeling that Islam is somehow foreign to American history. Muslims were there at the beginning. … Some of our founding fathers knew more about Islam than some members of Congress now.’

For her swearing in, Tlaib who is Palestinian-American, wore a traditional Palestinian thobe, or dress, which her mother was there for the swearing in – made for her as she was sworn in. Tlaib said:

Trump-loving conservative Christians also expressed their opinions on Twitter:

Other Twitter users were quick to explain the Constitution to the crazed fundamentalists:

The Department for Education has referred 676 state schools to the Health and Safety Executive, according to The Guardian.

Trade union bosses branded the numbers “shocking” and warned cash-strapped investigators might not be able to fully probe all the cases.

Around 500 people a year die from asbestos-related illnesses, according to official figures.

Kevin Courtney, general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “The fact that nearly 700 schools have been referred to HSE because they weren’t able to satisfy the DfE that they were managing their asbestos in line with legal requirements, is a shocking indictment of current systems of oversight.

“The lives of thousands of staff and pupils could be at risk in these schools.”

A Department for Education spokesman said: “The safety of pupils and staff is our highest priority which is why we have asked schools to provide information through the asbestos management assurance process.

“This data will help the department develop a greater understanding of the management of asbestos in schools.

“We plan to publish a report of the findings shortly.

Asbestos is a term for a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres. Before its dangers were known, asbestos was often used in buildings for insulation, flooring and roofing and sprayed on ceilings and walls. It is now banned in the UK. Buildings constructed before the year 2000 may still have asbestos in them. If the asbestos-containing materials inside these buildings remain intact, they pose very little risk. It’s only when these materials are damaged or disturbed that tiny asbestos fibres can be released into the air and breathed into your lungs. The symptoms of asbestos-related disease take many years – even decades – to appear after the original exposure to asbestos, so exposure a long time ago might only be showing up as a disease today.

HSE Spokeswomen said: “The HSE have worked with the DfE to use the AMAP returns to provide targeting intelligence for a planned programme of proactive visits to schools.

“This identified a number of schools in England to select from to be included within the profile of HSE visits planned across Great Britain.

“The visits will assess compliance in respect of the duty to manage asbestos with the school buildings.”",Nearly 700 schools ‘could have unsafe asbestos in their buildings putting thousands of pupils at risk’,education,school,381

""Saudi Arabia will coordinate with fellow oil producers to ensure adequate supplies are available to consumers while ensuring the global oil market does not go out of balance"", he said in a statement.

The Trump White House announced earlier in the day that in May, it will end all waivers granted to eight economies that have allowed them to bypass US sanctions and purchase Iranian oil.

""President Donald J. Trump has decided not to reissue Significant Reduction Exceptions (SREs) when they expire in early May. This decision is intended to bring Iran's oil exports to zero, denying the regime its principal source of revenue"", the statement said.

In addition, Washington announced that the US, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) would ensure that the global oil market would remain ""adequately supplied"".

The three nations ""have agreed to take timely action to assure that global demand is met as all Iranian oil is removed from the market"", the White House said in a statement, which was later reiterated by US President Donald Trump, who confirmed that Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members would ""make up"" for oil supply once the waivers are terminated.

In light of Washington's decision, oil prices have surged, reaching their highest in 2019: Internatonal benchmark Brent increased 2.6 percent to $73.87 a barrel, the highest since early November, while US crude futures rose 2.4 percent to $65.52.

1040299,theweekuk,"Climate change could make insurance unaffordable for ordinary people leading to wide-ranging social issues, the world’s largest reinsurance firm has warned.

Citing £18bn of losses from the recent Californian wildfires, Ernst Rauch, Munich Re’s chief climatologist, told The Guardian costs could soon be widely felt, with premium rises already under discussion with clients holding asset concentrations in vulnerable parts of the state.

“If the risk from wildfires, flooding, storms or hail is increasing then the only sustainable option we have is to adjust our risk prices accordingly. In the long run it might become a social issue,” he said, warning that “affordability is so critical [because] some people on low and average incomes in some regions will no longer be able to buy insurance.”

“What makes the insurance industry's relationship with climate change so unique is the fact that the industry is built on the concept of managing risk,” says The Ecologist, and “with climate change set to be one of the greatest risks of them all, insurers stand to be impacted in significant and far-reaching ways.”

Analysing decades worth of data, Munich Re, the world’s largest reinsurance company, concluded the spike in wildfires, and hence insurance claims, was “broadly consistent with climate change”.

It is the first time an insurer has linked wildfires to climate change, and the repercussions across the entire sector could be huge.

The UK insurance industry is the largest in Europe and the third largest in the world. The industry manages total investments that equate to 25% of the UK’s net worth, “making it pivotal to our economy”, says the Ecologist.

This “may also influence several court cases testing the liability of fossil fuel companies for the effects of global warming”, The Guardian says.

In the US, for example, numerous cities and one state — Rhode Island — are suing the oil industry over the impact of fossil fuel emissions.

“The litigation is likely to run for some years, and it is not yet clear whether it will be decided in state or federal courts”, says the Financial Times, “but if the 38 oil companies being sued lose, they are very likely to claim some or all of their costs back on their insurance policies.”

Neil Beresford, partner at law firm Clyde & Co, predicts “the insurance industry’s exposure could go up to tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars.”

This could easily see firms increase their premiums, the knock-on effect of which could pose a threat to social order warns Nicolas Jeanmart, the head of personal insurance, general insurance and macroeconomics at Insurance Europe, which speaks for 34 national insurance associations.

A court in the capital, Minsk, on February 12 began preliminary hearings in the case against Maryna Zolatava, editor in chief of the website Tut.by.

Dozens of people who came to the trial greeted Zolatava with applauds and supporting chants as she entered the courtroom. All of the courtroom's 170 seats were filled.

As the hearing started, Zolatava rejected all the charges.

""I have not committed any of the crimes I'm charged with,"" Zolatava said.

 

 The case has raised concerns by right advocates, who have warned about growing press restrictions under President Alyaksandr Lukashenka's government.

 

 In August, police officers searched Tut.by's Minsk offices, along with that of another outlet, BelaPan. Several reporters and employees, including Zolatava, were detained.

 

 The Belarusian Investigative Committee later alleged that computers from within the Tut.by and BelaPan offices used an account and password other than their own to access the paid subscriber section of BelTA, the state-run news agency. A third outlet, Belarusskaya Nauka, was also targeted.

 

 ""The crime inflicted considerable damage"" on BelTA, ""leading to the illegal procurement and use of information protected from unauthorized access, as well as to the erosion of the enterprise’s business reputation,"" the committee charged.

 

 In all, 15 people faced charges. However, all except for Zolatava had charges dropped after paying administrative fines and damages.

 

 Zolatava, meanwhile, was hit with new charges of ""official inaction,"" a charge comparable to negligence.

 

 She has denied the allegations.

 

 Independent Belarusian media have faced severe restrictions for years under Lukashenka's authoritarian government.

 

 In June, lawmakers passed controversial amendments to the country's media laws, which media advocates warned would likely to lead to further censorship of the press.

 

 A month later, a journalist was sentenced to four years of restricted movement and forced labor after being convicted of assaulting two police officers. The reporter, Dzmitry Halko, said the case against him was retribution for his critical stance against Lukashenka.

361623,newsweek,"Almost 20 years after measles was eliminated from the U.S., 2019 could see the highest rates of the dangerous disease in three decades, an expert has warned.

A combination of the efforts of the small but extremely vocal anti-vaccine movement and barriers to accessing shots in some communities has sparked outbreaks of the potentially deadly—but entirely preventable—disease across the country.

In the decade prior to the deployment of the first measles vaccine in 1963, an estimated three to four million people in the U.S. were infected with the disease. It killed between 400 to 500 people each year. An outbreak in school-aged children in 1989 prompted immunologists and pediatricians to push for a country-wide immunization program. The campaign was a success: By 2000, the disease was eliminated, defined as reduced to zero incidences for more than 12 months, short of eradication where this effect is seen worldwide.

However, efforts to prevent measles have unraveled, and 2019 could be the “worst year for measles” since 1989, Professor William Moss, a specialist in epidemiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Newsweek. ""[This forecast] points to the fact that we are losing ground to this disease that once killed millions of children each year,” said Moss.

While a spokesperson for the CDC tempered Moss’s prediction, and told Newsweek it is too early to predict how many cases there will be in 2019, the figures from 2018 lay bare the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy in pockets of the country.

Some 349 cases of measles were identified across 26 states and the District of Columbia last year: The second highest levels in the U.S. since an outbreak in 2014 sickened 667 people. Last year’s bouts included the worst in New York since the 1990s, mostly affecting members of Orthodox Jewish communities and unvaccinated travelers returning from Israel.

And the issue has bled into 2019. In Clark County, Washington, a total of 38 people—including 27 children under the age of 10—have so far been affected by a measles outbreak which led its governor to declare a state of emergency to channel public funds to tackling the problem. Three unvaccinated members of the same family have been diagnosed with the disease in Atlanta, Georgia. Meanwhile, outbreaks in New York State, New York City, and New Jersey, are ongoing.

The anti-vaccine movement has played an important role in the reemergence of measles, Moss explained. The swell of distrust towards the MMR vaccine—which safely protects against measles, mumps and rubella—partly stems from the false claims made by disgraced former doctor Andrew Wakefield. In 2010, he was struck from the medical register for publishing a 1998 study in The Lancet journal wrongly linking the MMR vaccine to autism. The work has since been shown to be false and with no scientific basis.

Regardless of this, his claims have been spread online by anti-vaccine campaigners on both sides of the political spectrum. Anti-vaccine sentiment has even been peddled by President Donald Trump, who invited Wakefield to his inaugural ball.

Last year, a study published in the journal PLOS suggested the number of children not being vaccinated due to their parents' non-medical, philosophical beliefs had risen in the 12 of the 18 states which allow this: Arkansas, Arizona, Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Utah. Metropolitan areas including Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; Phoenix, Arizona; Salt Lake City, Utah; Houston, Texas; as well as smaller counties in Idaho, Wisconsin, and Utah were identified as “hotspots” for anti-vaccine attitudes which leaves populations vulnerable to preventable diseases, the researchers concluded.

Indeed, an outbreak of measles among a Somali community in 2017 was a direct result of a targeted campaign by such groups, Professor Helen Bedford, an epidemiology expert at the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, U.K., told Newsweek. The rise of vaccine hesitancy has become such a concern that the World Health Organization named it as one of the biggest health threats of 2019 earlier this month.

But while the movement “must be taken seriously,” pinning the blame solely on anti-vaxxers risks giving the movement more credit than it deserves, she said. After all, only around 2 percent of the U.S. population opposes vaccines, Bedford said.

Importations, where an individual brings the disease from a country where vaccine rates are low, are another “major issue,” said Bedford, pointing to the cases in New York’s Orthodox Jewish communities linked to Israel.

""Research has shown that these communities are not necessarily opposed to the vaccine but often have difficulties with access, often having large families which can make it difficult to attend for vaccination,” Bedford explained.

Irrespective of the motivations for an individual being unvaccinated, the worrying outcomes are the same. Vaccines are able to eliminate conditions because of what is known as herd immunity. This is where a population is protected from an infectious disease because the vast majority of people have been vaccinated against it. That not only means an individual won’t fall ill themselves, but is less likely to pass it to the most vulnerable who can’t receive shots because their immune systems are too weak. Newborn babies and children with cancer fall into this category.

For herd immunity to work, at least 90 to 95 percent of the population must have up-to-date vaccines. Getting shots is therefore sometimes regarded as a public duty. Tellingly, between 2017 and 2018 only 77.6 percent of children from kindergarten to 12th grade in Clark County received all their shots. The graphic below was provided by Statista.

Often underscoring vaccine hesitancy is the false belief that measles is not particularly dangerous, while the measles vaccine is. But once herd immunity is compromised, individuals risk contracting a disease which can kill or severely disable sufferers, said Moss. ""The measles vaccine is very safe"" and measles is ""completely preventable,"" he stated.

The disease poses the greatest risk to children younger than five, and adults above the age of 20, as well pregnant women, and those with weak immune systems.

Alyssa Hernandez, whose 2-year-old son is not healthy enough to be vaccinated after receiving a liver transplant, lives in California where some counties have vaccine rates lower than 90 percent. She recently told NBC News: ""I’m scared to take him out. I’m scared to have him go to school, because you don’t know what’s around.""

First, measles can cause a high fever, cough, and runny nose, followed by a rash that spreads from the head to the rest of the body. An infectious person can spread the disease four days before and after the rash appears.

It can trigger complications such as pneumonia—the biggest cause of death in young children with measles—as well as encephalitis, which causes the brain to swell and can trigger convulsions, deafness and intellectual disabilities.

Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases, told Newsweek outbreaks of measles such as that in Clark County should act as “a reminder to parents that many diseases rarely seen in the United States can affect their unvaccinated children.

“There’s no way to tell if a child’s case will be mild or serious. It is best to protect our children rather than treat them,” she said.

Moss advised parents who are confused by vaccinations ""to speak to someone who is informed and who they can trust, such as their child’s pediatrician or nurse practitioner.""

""Parents need to be very wary of information they find on the internet as many sites present false or misleading information about vaccines,"" he argued. ""Websites to be trusted include those of the CDC or World Health Organizations. These are organizations with the goal of protecting children from disease.""

To combat the wider issue of vaccine hesitancy, Bedford argues those on the right side of the debate should use tools like social media and celebrity endorsements—which have been harnessed by anti-vaxxers to devastating effect—to inform parents that the MMR shot is safe, and measles can be deadly.

“We need to have key community advocates talk about the danger of measles and the benefits and safety of measles vaccines, including physicians, lawmakers, celebrities, sports figures and parents whose children have suffered or died from measles,"" said Bedford.

""We need smart laws that promote public health while recognizing individual rights, and that are designed to reduce the risk of measles outbreaks,” she said, pointing to recent legislative changes in California following an outbreak in Disney as an example.

Bedford added: “There is no reason—other than medical contraindications, for example children with cancer—that a child in the U.S. should not be protected against measles.""",2019 Could Be Worst Year for Measles in U.S. for 30 Years: 'We're Losing Ground to a Disease That Once Killed Millions',health,diseases and conditions,1363
1069276,upi,"Dec. 29 (UPI) -- Ukraine's government and Russian-backed separatists swapped 200 prisoners Sunday in an effort to end a standoff in the Donbas region.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's office confirmed on Twitter that 76 prisoners held by separatists had been returned to the government and representatives for the Luhansk and Donetsk regions of Ukraine said the government returned 124 separatist prisoners.

The prisoner exchange Sunday made good on promises in peace talks between Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Paris at the beginning of December.

Nine people elected not to return to the separatists in Luhansk and four refused to return to the government in Kyiv.

The exchange took place at a checkpoint in east Ukraine, where violent conflicts following the Russian annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014 has resulted in more than 13,000 deaths.

Among those freed in the exchange were soldiers, activists, alleged spies and riot police officers accused of shooting protesters during the 2014 revolution.

The exchange was viewed as a victory for Zelensky, who was elected in April after campaigning to release Ukrainian prisoners and end the war.

The U.S. embassy in Kyiv issued a statement on Twitter praising the exchange.

Billionaires around the world, who have almost doubled in number since the 2008 global financial crisis, saw their combined fortunes grow by $2.5bn a day, while the 3.8 billion people at the bottom of the scale saw their wealth decline by 11 percent in 2018, said the UK-based charity's annual inequality report on Monday.

The findings were released in the face of the World Economic Forum, which kicks off in the Swiss city of Davos on Tuesday.

The world's richest man, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, saw his fortune increase to $112bn last year, Oxfam said, pointing out that just one percent of his wealth was the equivalent to the entire health budget of Ethiopia, a country of 105 million people.

Analysts found that 3.4 billion people have barely escaped extreme poverty and are living on less than $5.50 a day while stressing the growing gap between rich and poor was undermining the fight against poverty, damaging economies, and increasing public anger.

""Our economy is broken with hundreds of millions of people living in extreme poverty while huge rewards go to those at the very top,"" Oxfam said.

""People across the globe are angry and frustrated,"" warned Winnie Byanyima, Oxfam's executive director, in a statement.

""Governments must now deliver real change by ensuring corporations and wealthy individuals pay their fair share of tax,"" she added, arguing this money could be used for education and healthcare to lift people out of poverty.

The report also said women and girls are the hardest hit by rising inequality, as men own 50 percent more of the total global wealth and control 86 percent of corporations.

Oxfam analysts acknowledged the number of extremely poor people was reduced by half between 1990 and 2010, and has since fallen further to 736 million.

They also noted, however, tax rates for high incomes have fallen in wealthy countries over the past decades.

""The super-rich and corporations are paying lower rates of tax than they have in decades,"" the Oxfam report said, pointing out ""the human costs - children without teachers, clinics without medicines - are huge.""

Calls for increased taxes on the wealthy have multiplied amid growing popular outrage in a number of countries over swelling inequality.

In the United States, new Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made headlines earlier this month by proposing to tax the ultra-rich up to 70 percent.

And in Europe, the ""yellow vest"" movement that has rocked France with anti-government protests since November is demanding that President Emmanuel Macron repeal controversial tax cuts on high earners.

Oxfam said getting the world's richest one percent to pay just 0.5 percent extra tax on their wealth could raise more money than it would cost to educate the 262 million children out of school, and provide life-saving healthcare for 3.3 million people.

It also suggested governments look again at taxes on inheritances or property, which have been reduced or eliminated in much of the developed world and barely implemented in the developing world.",Oxfam: World's richest 26 own same wealth as poorest half,politics,non-governmental organisation,506
290672,lifesitenews,"December 17, 2019 (CatholicCulture.org) — When social scientists study family life, one factor trumps all others. Study after study confirms what common sense suggests: children are better off when they are raised in an intact home, raised by their mothers and fathers together.

The data are overwhelming, and they all point in the same direction. Children raised in a single-parent household are, statistically:
• less likely to perform well in school,
• more likely to live in poverty as adults,
• less likely to be physically healthy,
• more likely to compile a criminal record,
• less likely to earn a college degree,
• more likely to suffer emotional disorders,
• less likely to succeed professionally,
• more likely to abuse alcohol or recreational drugs,
• less likely to marry and stay married, and therefore
• more likely to continue the cycle of misery by becoming single parents themselves.

Yet despite what we know about all these problems, our nation’s policies continue to encourage single-parent households. Welfare programs encourage women to give birth out of wedlock, and penalize them for marrying the babies’ fathers. Lawyers paid by the government help women secure divorces, and social workers (again paid by the government) discourage reconciliation. Tax deductions and outright subsidies are available to parents who send their children to day-care centers — but not those who care for their children in their own homes.

Here’s another common-sense observation that social science confirms: If you subsidize something, you’ll get more of it; if you tax it, you’ll get less. Sure enough, after decades of misbegotten family policies, the US now leads the world — by a wide margin — in the one category most likely to produce societal disaster.

Today nearly one-fourth of all American children — 23% — are living in a single-parent household. No other country comes close to that mark. In most European countries the figure is in the low to middle teens; in Asia, below ten. In 1965, when Daniel Patrick Moynihan called attention to a crisis in the African-American family, he pointed to the rate of out-of-wedlock births: 25%. At the current rate the entire nation will surpass that rate within the next year or two.

The implications of that shocking statistic are predictable. Over the next generation — barring a dramatic change in our society — we will face higher rates of crime, drug addiction, welfare dependency, unemployment, emotional pathology, and, yes, family breakdown. (Oh, and by the way China, which is bidding to replace the US as the world’s superpower, won’t have the same problems; there the percentage of children in single-parent households is just 3%.)

A BBC freedom of information (FOI) application found 19 officers from Avon and Somerset Police have a criminal record.

The force said the suitability of those convicted of an offence to keep their job would always be reviewed.

Steven Smith, who was assaulted by an officer from Avon and Somerset, said he wanted a change in the law.

The force said nine of the convictions came before the individuals joined the constabulary, while 10 were committed by serving officers.

The force, which employs 2,771 officers, said the offences included burglary, assault and deception.

PC Mark Foster was convicted of assault after placing Steven Smith in a hold outside a Bristol pub in 2014.

He was found guilty of assault at Bristol Crown Court in 2016 but the judge said he would still be ""an asset to the force"".

Following a police misconduct hearing, PC Foster was permitted to keep his job.

Mr Smith thinks the force should not employ anyone with a criminal record.

""If it's violence or excessive force I do think maybe a law change could be a good idea,"" he said.

Avon and Somerset Police said: ""When officers are charged with offences, they will be subject to open and transparent court procedures and could then face internal misconduct processes.

""The suitability of those convicted of an offence to remain employed by the constabulary will always be reviewed and the circumstances relating to their conviction will be taken into consideration when a decision is made.""

588029,theconservativetreehouse,"It’s an interesting exercise to consider just how much national economic policy shifts can impact U.S. workers and industry.  Only a few years ago the ‘best play‘ for auto executives was shifting manufacturing overseas or to Mexico.

Today, with the advent of a comprehensive energy policy, enhanced U.S. investment incentives, re-prioritized trade expectations, focused tariffs, lowered regulations, and expanded  economic freedom allowing consumer demand to drive investment decisions, the entire landscape of a massive industry shifts.

Now the ‘best play‘ is for multinational firms to focus on expanded investment directly in the U.S.A.  Simple, yet stunningly consequential:

The announcement comes on the heels of cross-town rival GM axing 4,000 workers, and is part of the $11 billion restructuring Ford announced last fall that includes dropping all passenger car models except the iconic Mustang. It is shifting resources to light trucks, like those it is building in the Windy City. […] The investment plan will allow Ford to expand capacity for the Explorer as well as the new Explorer Police Interceptor it is launching. Ford has traditionally dominated the market for police vehicles and expects the Interceptor — which debuted last month at the Detroit Auto Show — to expand its hold. Also scheduled to go into the Chicago Assembly Plant is the all-new Lincoln Aviator, a big, three-row sedan that is winning early praise and could become a critical part of Ford’s drive to revive the long-struggling luxury brand. The $1 billion investment will be used to add “advanced manufacturing technologies,” according to company sources, and also to train workers to both boost plant efficiency and improve quality.  (read more)

This decision by FORD actually becomes an example of what CTH was predicting prior to the 2016 election.  Specifically about FORD; and specifically about the auto industry.

FLASHBACK TO 2016: […]  This key distinction is the heart of the Economic Patriotism argument.

An argument that Bernie Sanders has made effectively, Donald Trump has also recognized, and one which through the course of time -and history has empirically evidenced- creates terrible long-term consequences for the rapidly diminishing middle class U.S. worker.

The economic patriotism distinction is also where traditionally minded conservatives, like myself, have reevaluated the bigger picture and accepted the following:  In a global world the concept of traditional economic models (for free-market capitalism) are no longer working on behalf of the United States of America – because there is no national pride or incentive attached to the end goal, profit.

Paul Samuelson, the Nobel laureate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, recalled that John Maynard Keynes once was challenged for altering his position on some economic issue:

While I have never agreed with Keynesian economic theory, Keynes attributed quote itself is never more apropos than today’s 2016 American economics argument amid various conservatives.   What good is Mark Levin’s definition of conservatism, when there’s no middle class America left to conserve?

What good are George Will’s free market theories when the end result is the outflow of American wealth into poorer, less economically developed countries, while we EBT ourselves into a national debt crisis because we are trying to sustain the diminished value of the American worker?

Not only is this historic approach now rapidly becoming the pathway into an unrecoverable American economic death spiral, it is also global wealth distribution done by Wall Street, not Main Street.

The result, our result, is an ever expanding, seemingly impossible to stop, wealth gap, creating an unnatural and profoundly unhealthy class system, in America, between the “Rich” and “Poor”.

We do not need socialism to fix the problem, we need economic patriotism from industrial giants, Main Street, who value the principles behind putting American-workers-First. (link)

Thankfully, two-months after writing everything above, the American electorate voted to put a Main Street President Trump into office.  Today U.S. jobs are plentiful, wages are growing, inflation is low and entire industries are recommitting to the U.S. worker.

Ironically, a few days ago that same economically patriotic president just said “We will never be a socialist country”…

In July, before the connections between the MIT Media Lab and Jeffrey Epstein came to light, The New York Times Magazine published a thorough and damning article about the pernicious effects of outside funding on MIT, including the media lab.

MIT had taken money from the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, as had the famed media lab, which the article cleverly points out isn’t much of a media organization. Joi Ito, the now-deposed head of the lab and also now a former member of the board of the company that owns The Times, showed his contempt for the media by being vague, evasive, and unhelpful when asked to clarify who had donated how much and what their status was.

Together with the Epstein episode, details around Ito’s departure (particularly in Ronan Farrow's piece in The New Yorker on Friday), point to the corporate rot at the heart of pseudo-academic institutions like the media lab and, for that matter, full-on academic institutions like MIT. According to the magazine article, corporate donors—called “members”—who pay at least $250,000 a year make up the majority of the Media Lab’s annual budget. In other words, while these institutions project the appearance of being focused on academic pursuits—finding the truth, asking tough questions, pursuing independent lines of exploration, and so on—in reality they are corporate lap dogs fetching the balls their masters throw. (Slate also had a good take with more insider details on the vibe at the Media Lab.)

The point here is that these institutions can afford to pay their own way. MIT’s endowment exceeds $16 billion. And yet they insist on chasing dollars from organizations whose jobs, no matter what the Business Roundtable says, is to make money. Getting mixed up with unsavory donors is the tip of the iceberg of why that’s problematic.

6383,activistpost,"Reports have emerged depicting long lines in front of a physical gold sales location in Germany, in view of pending legislation which would once again lower the anonymous purchase limit, this time from €10,000 to €2,000. The last drop happened in 2017 when the limit was set at €15,000. A draft bill from the German finance ministry is being pointed to as the reason for the change, which is scheduled to take effect from Jan. 10, 2020.

In a tweet posted Wednesday, precious metals consultant and analyst Dan Popescu shared a picture of a long line of people waiting in front of “Degussa store to buy gold in Köln.” Popescu described, “From Jan. 1, 2020, the limit to buy gold anonymously drops from €10,000 down to €2,000. Only two years ago the limit was €15,000.” One user posted his own photo and replied “This is me line at Degussa in 23rd. The employees said they haven’t seen anything like it before.” To give an idea of the relatively small amount of gold €2,000 (~$2,224) can buy, even a 50g gold bar is currently too expensive.

After the new legislation takes effect, reports from German media state that purchases of the precious metal over €2,000 will now require customer identification for buyers, including criminal background checks for businesses. The news outlet details:

If given final approval, the German draft bill designed to implement EU guidelines as laid out in the anti-money laundering directive AMLD5, will take effect on Jan. 10. This is the stated deadline for member states to implement legislation accommodative of the directive.

Residents of the country appear to be very concerned about the impending limitation, as the European Central Bank (ECB) continues to draw fire for its controversial economic polices such as negative interest rates. Also for newly installed ECB President Christine Lagarde’s recent criticism of perceived German conservatism. Skeptical reactions were voiced on Reddit as well, with one user stating:

The Far Reaching Arm of AMLD5

As news.Bitcoin.com previously reported, the 5th EU anti-money laundering directive has big implications for holders of crypto and crypto businesses. Its impending policies have already squeezed some out of the industry, at least temporarily, but crypto is far from the only area that will be affected.

Per the legislation, non-transparent assets, accounts, and even private safety deposit boxes will now be subject to state information gathering by law. Gold is a bastion for private value storage, so the stricter limits come as no surprise. AMLD5 focuses on combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) and preventing money laundering (AML), but given the state of economic affairs in the EU, skeptics maintain the new laws are part of a larger bid to establish financial control and force users to remain stuck in a faltering system.

The fact that the ECB is now also in development of its own digital currency system amplifies these concerns, as one of the last remaining escapes from bank-imposed negative interest rates is to hold paper cash privately. With central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), negative rates can be applied directly to the asset, effectively closing this escape route.

Gold is thus seen as one of the final hedges against irresponsible government policy, and the proposed new limits on the precious metal will leave residents of Germany with even fewer options. The encroaching ECB and German policies have many on social media suggesting permissionless cryptocurrencies, which can be traded privately, as a means to hedge against the growing surveillance state.

697533,theguardianuk,"Pupils from Asian and white-majority areas are put into a classroom together in a well-intentioned social experiment that fails to get to the root of prejudice

Amina, a brown-skinned, teenage, Muslim pupil from Saltley academy, a secondary school in a predominantly brown-skinned Muslim area of Birmingham, thinks white people have different accents. “They’re like: ‘Ew, yew fucking plonkah!’” Her friends, of similar ethnic and religious heritage, think white people have “really messy houses”, they “don’t give a shit” and have “alcohol bottles everywhere”. They “have their feet up watching TV with a bowl of popcorn on the sofa”. There also seems to be a consensus that white people go to “naked beaches” a lot.

White-skinned Lucas from Tamworth Enterprise, a secondary school in a predominantly white area of Birmingham a few miles away, thinks Muslims “worship a god called Allah and their prophet is Muhammad Ali”. He is doing better than Lauren, who thinks Islam may be a country, and Dan, who reckons Mecca is a YouTuber. They and their friends think Muslims wear burqas, smell of curry, shop at Primark and can be “horrible and nasty people”.

“That’s because of terrorism,” Cabdul explains wearily to his fellow Saltlerians as outrage begins to build.

Welcome to The Great British School Swap (Channel 4). It is the same premise you have seen before, only this time it is set in schools instead of homes. Or it is the other premise you have seen before, but this time looking at race and religion instead of money and class. Two groups of people who don’t normally meet are forced to spend time together in each other’s environments in the hope they can all learn something about themselves, about each other and, hey, maybe about life, too.

In this opening episode, the Tamworth teenagers (a dozen boys and girls aged 13 and 14) are bussed across the invisible lines that separate them from Saltley. They will take part in a week of specially devised lessons aimed at making both groups think more deeply about messages they have received uncritically and ideas they have internalised.

As is almost always the case with even the most well-intentioned social-experiment programmes, the pace is dizzying and the results maddeningly superficial. There are plenty of telly-worthy moments – the strangely pure innocence of Dan, for example, as he explains earnestly that he doesn’t use the word “Paki” because, in Tamworth, “there’s no Pakis around to say it to”, or the explanation from one student to another of what a golliwog is: “A black doll, costs about £7.”

There is the standout character around whom a whole series could be built: the mighty Kiran, who has yet to have an unexpressed thought. On white girls’ clothing, she says: “You seen ’em on the streets in short skirts and boob jobs? Are you being serious? Keep it PG!” Talking about a transgender pupil, Lucas (a model of impressive grace under increasing pressure, as his gender becomes a source of growing fascination to many Saltley students), she admits: “Do you want my honest opinion? I just don’t like gay people. I feel weird around them.”

And yet she is charming. She is clearly wrestling with herself and the received wisdom with which she has grown up. The obviousness of the cogs turning is enough to give you hope. As Mr Turnkey, the headteacher at Tamworth, says: “The important thing is that we’re working with minds still open to change.”

But it feels so slight, so fragmentary. The sense of the programme itself preaching to the choir is pervasive. Of course, you can take your own deep dives into more thoughtful waters off the rocky promontories that the pupils’ unguarded words, attitudes and relationships provide, but only if you are already that way inclined.

If you want to inspire deeper thought among a wider demographic – as you surely should, to justify putting these children in extremely exposing positions – then you need to drill down, follow through, unpick some issues and lay them out for examination.

It isn’t clear yet whether the next two episodes will do that. A trailer for next week’s show, which concentrates more on the children’s parents, suggests that, whether it is as superficial or not, it is going to be several degrees bleaker as they work with minds less open to change.

On the upside, you can already see the two dozen children doing each other good. Simply getting to know each other – none of them drunk, naked, terrorists or clad in Primark – is enough to have an effect. It’s so simple, isn’t it? And so, so hard.",The Great British School Swap review – racial harmony? It's child's play,education,school,761

Monday that the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) will introduce the use
of a second vaccine to control and in the long term eradicate the Ebola

2018 in the country's eastern North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

Nation**_](https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/DRC-New-Drug-Cures-Two-Ebola-
Patients-Brings-Hope-to-Congo-20190816-0016.html)

“The health authorities in the DRC have announced plans to introduce a second
experimental Ebola vaccine, manufactured by Johnson & Johnson (J&J), from mid-
October,” the WHO said in its statement, adding that the vaccine will be
provided “to targeted at-risk populations in areas that do not have active
Ebola transmission.”

The new experimental vaccine will complement the current one produced by U.S.
pharmaceutical group Merck, whose product will continue to be provided to
health workers and people at high risk of infection.

Last July, the WHO recognized a shortage of the Merck vaccine, while J&J says
it has 1.5 million doses of its vaccine to introduce to the market, meaning
that if DRC wants to immunize people in other parts of the country it will
need more supplies from both pharmaceutical giants.

J&J’s vaccine introduction has sparked controversy among DRC health officials.
The country’s health minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga presented his resignation in
July after President  [Felix Tshisekedi](https://www.telesurenglish.net/news
/DR-Congos-Tshisekedi-to-Release-700-Political-Prisoners-20190314-0003.html)
stripped him of the management of the pandemic.

Kalenga had denounced the creation of parallel chains of authority and the
interference in the management of the response to the epidemic, but also the
urging from foreign actors to introduce the second vaccine to be tested in
DRC.

The former minister had expressed that the vaccine currently used proved its
efficiency since it is estimated to be 97.5 percent effective, with the
capacity to protect a person up to 12 months.

""It would be fanciful to think that the new vaccine proposed by actors, who
have shown an obvious lack of ethics by voluntarily hiding important
information from medical authorities, could have a significant impact on the
control of the current outbreak,"" the ex-official had stated recalling that

While J&J states on its website that it has tested the product on more than
6,000 volunteers in several trials, defenders including the WHO and the
international medical organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF), have urged
for its use, arguing that all ""available tools and resources"" must be
mobilized to end the epidemic.

Backers of the use of the experimental vaccine proposed to use it to vaccinate
and protect people outside the outbreak zone.

Health expert and United States law professor Lawrence Gostin welcomed on
Monday the decision to introduce the experimental vaccine. ""We need a major
increase in vaccination coverage in the DRC ... [so] it must be rapidly
implemented,"" Gostin told Al Jazeera.

""It is well within the power of DRC health authorities to educate the public
without confusing them about the differences in the vaccines. The bottom line
is simple; they are both very effective vaccines,"" he added.

Ebola’s crisis grew rapidly since it resurfaced 13 months ago, and is [the
second largest](https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/Ebola-Outbreak-in-DR-
Congo-Now-Second-Largest-in-History-20181130-0010.html) one just behind the
crisis that hit West Africa in 2014.

Active armed groups and communities’ profound distrust in the medical health
teams have so far hindered the efforts to stop the outbreak. However, and
among the unrest, health workers have managed to vaccinate around 225,000
people with the Merck vaccine.

6236,activistpost,"Dr. Francis Schaeffer was an historian, Christian philosopher and one of the greatest thinkers of the last century. In Episode X (the final segment) of his video series, How Should We Then Live?, he stated that society was falling into a moral abyss with no fixed absolutes to provide form and structure for living. To replace that necessary structure and thereby avoid utter societal chaos, he accurately and clearly recognized that such absolutes would be supplied by an increasingly authoritarian, technocratic elite. (Yes, Schaeffer actually used the word “technocratic”.)

In other words, as people lost the ability to self-regulate their own life and behavior, someone or something would step into the vacuum and do it for them.

A younger contemporary of Schaeffer was Zbigniew Brzezinski, who wrote Between Two Ages: America’s Role in the Technetronic Era when he was a political science professor at Columbia University in the late 1960s. Brzezinski was the polar opposite of Schaeffer in that he eschewed Christianity, Christian philosophy and even the existence of God.

Brzezinski came to virtually the same conclusion as Schaeffer (for entirely different reasons) when he wrote,

Such a society would be dominated by an elite whose claim to political power would rest on allegedly superior scientific know-how. Unhindered by the restraints of traditional liberal values, this elite would not hesitate to achieve its political ends by using the latest modern techniques for influencing public behavior and keeping society under close surveillance and control. Under such circumstances, the scientific and technological momentum of the country would not be reversed but would actually feed on the situation it exploits. (emphasis added)

Since Schaeffer was an avid reader, he likely had read Brzezinski’s work, but I can find no proof of that. He did, however, read Daniel Bell’s seminal 1973 book, The Coming of Post-Industrial Society: A Venture in Social Forecasting.

Bell had received his PhD in sociology from Columbia University in 1961. We know he was well acquainted with Brzezinski’s work because he thoroughly critiqued it in his own book.

There are two reasons that I bring up Bell: first, he was a self-professed apologist for Technocracy and second, Schaeffer held up Bell’s book toward the end of Episode X and quoted from page 480:

Bell was indeed a big thinker in the same vein as Brzezinski; both were Technocrats and both were educated at Columbia University where Technocracy was originally conceived in 1932. Bell, however, was much more direct than Brzezinski when he wrote,

It was Bell who first popularized and developed the concept of the “post-industrial” society:

Bell’s 489-page “essay in social forecasting” presented the big picture of the future. It was ominously written in the same year (1973) that the Trilateral Commission was co-founded by Brzezinski and David Rockefeller.

Now, I had already cited Bell’s works in both of my books on Technocracy, but I had fallen short in examining who or what might have stimulated Bell to write his book in the first place. This became my 2019 surprise as I picked up my own copy of Bell’s The Coming of Post-Industrial Society (the same edition that Schaeffer referenced above) and read its Preface more carefully:

My greatest debt, institutionally, is to the Russell Sage Foundation and its president, Orville Brim. A grant from the foundation in 1967 at first released me from one-third of my teaching schedule at Columbia, and allowed me to organize an experimental graduate seminar at Columbia on modes of forecasting. The foundation also subsidized my research in the next few years. In 1969-1970 I spent a sabbatical year as a visiting fellow at the foundation, where this book began to take shape. (emphasis added)

Essentially, Bell was employed by the Russell Sage Foundation as he fleshed out his book.

The Russell Sage Foundation, launched in 1907, is one of the oldest foundations in America. It started as an ultra-progressive champion of “social sciences” and has been continuously connected to the most progressive elements of the global elite ever since. Its website currently states,

Not surprisingly, the historical archives of the Russell Sage Foundation are housed at the Rockefeller Archive Center in New York.

The academic support for modern Technocracy is obvious and easily traced. The literature is pointed and definitive: they all envisaged a technocratic elite rising to dominate populations.

Given this vision, it is no surprise that the Trilateral Commission sprang forth in 1973 to “make it so” – with “Captain Brzezinski” at the helm as its first Executive Director.

1011711,thetelegraph,"Prepare your homes for flooding, the Met Office has warned as sandbags were handed out ahead of the expected midweek downpour.

Severe weather warnings with the potential for homes and businesses to be “flooded quickly” have been issued for the next two days by the Met Office.

Forecasters have said that a second band of low pressure will hit the country on Tuesday with half a months rainfall predicted in just a few hours in parts of the South West and Wales.

The Met Office said the warnings meant “that homes and businesses could be flooded quickly, with damage to some buildings from floodwater, lightning strikes, hail or strong winds.”

They added that the floodwater could be “fast flowing or deep” with a substantial risk of lightning strikes, hail and strong winds.

Yesterday, Fire Services worked alongside the Environment Agency in Manchester to  hand out sandbags after flooding on Sunday night as further bad weather is predicted over the coming days.

695315,theguardianuk,"Insects have “no place to hide” from climate change, scientists have said after analysing 50 years’ worth of UK data.

The study found that woodlands, whose shade was expected to protect species from warming temperatures, are just as affected by climate change as open grasslands.

The research examined records of the first springtime flights of butterflies, moths and aphids and the first eggs of birds between 1965 and 2012. As average temperatures have risen, aphids are now emerging a month earlier, and birds are laying eggs a week earlier. The scientists said this could mean animals were becoming “out of sync” with their prey, with potentially serious ramifications for ecosystems.

Researchers are increasingly concerned about dramatic drops in populations of insects, which underpin much of nature. In February it was said that these falls could lead to a “catastrophic collapse of nature’s ecosystems”, and in March there was further evidence of widespread loss of pollinating insects in recent decades in Britain.

Other studies, from Germany and Puerto Rico, have shown falling numbers in the last 25 to 35 years. Another showed butterflies in the Netherlands had declined by at least 84% over the last 130 years.

James Bell, at Rothamsted Research institute, who led the woodlands research, said: “Under global warming you would expect woodlands to have some protection for insects, a buffer against change. But we didn’t see that. It is the major surprise and is disturbing. There is really no place to hide against the effects of global warming if you are an insect in the UK.”

Another surprise was that insects and birds living in farmland are emerging later in the spring, not earlier as expected. “We can only assume this is to do with other, non-climate factors,” Bell said. The loss of wild areas and changing crop types could be among the factors, he said, along with declining food availability leading to delayed breeding.

James Pearce-Higgins, of the British Trust for Ornithology, said: “Birds are at the top of many food chains and are sensitive to the impacts of climate change on the availability of their insect prey.”

A separate new study found that populations of birds that rely on insects for food fell by 13% across Europe between 1990 and 2015, and by 28% in Denmark, which the scientists used as a national case study. The omnivorous birds assessed did not show a decline.

The UK research, published in the journal Global Change Biology, found that the shift to earlier emergence or egg-laying varied considerably according to the type of habitat and how far north the species lives. Aphids breed very rapidly and can adapt to changing temperatures quickly. Their first flight is now an average of 30 days earlier than 50 years ago. Birds, butterflies and moths are appearing one to two weeks earlier.

Bell said the changing timings were affecting farming, with aphids arriving earlier but potato crops being planted later due to wetter winters. This combination meant the aphids, which transmit viruses, were attacking much younger plants. “Plants are just like babies, with very poorly developed immune systems, so when a virus is transmitted into a young potato plant it has a much greater effect,” he said.

Jon Pickup, of the Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture division of the Scottish government, said: “As pests, it remains a concern that aphid migrations are getting earlier at a dramatic rate and this piece of work shows us that signal across the UK very clearly.”

Bell said timing mismatches were also affecting wildlife. “For example, the leafing date of the oak tree determines when the caterpillars will appear, and that determines when blue tits that feed on caterpillars lay their first egg,” he said. “If they become desynchronised, it has cascading effects through the food chain, leading to fewer eggs, and this has been seen.”

During February’s exceptionally warm weather there were sightings of rooks nesting, ladybirds mating and dozens of migratory swallows arriving along the south-west coast, all more than a month ahead of schedule.","Insects have ‘no place to hide’ from climate change, study warns",environment,nature,659
185603,eveningstandard,"There have been some iconic moments at the London Stadium. Super Saturday and Usain Bolt winning 100m gold at London 2012 have gone down in history and memorable goals from Dimitri Payet and more recently Aaron Cresswell have helped West Ham start to create new memories at their new home.

On Sunday, West Ham Women get a chance to provide their own special moment when they play there for the first time.

A crowd of around 20,000 is expected to watch West Ham play London rivals Tottenham in the WSL on what will be a landmark day for the Hammers.

“The London Stadium is so historic for so many reasons,” said West Ham Women managing director Jack Sullivan.

“The players are going to be doing their prehab where Usain Bolt, Mo Farah and Jessica Ennis-Hill have warmed up.

""They are going to be on the pitch where Andy Carroll did that amazing overhead kick against Crystal Palace and Dimitri Payet ran from the halfway line against Middlesbrough.

“We wanted to say 'you are part of West Ham, you are not just the women’s team, you are part of all these historical events at the stadium'. Hopefully we can make an important memory of a great moment at the London Stadium for this team as well, by scoring a great goal or something.”

West Ham have had just five weeks to promote ticket sales for the game but that rush has been no problem for a club that has grown rapidly and is in a hurry to establish themselves at the top of the women’s game.

In the past 18 months, West Ham have turned professional, moved up two divisions into the WSL as part of a league restructure and reached last season’s FA Cup Final at Wembley.

Sullivan’s aim is to secure a sustainable future for the club as interest in the women's game grows after the success England had in reaching the World Cup semi-finals in the summer.

“It is a great time to be part of women’s football, but we have got to make sure this time becomes permanent,” said 19-year-old Sullivan. “The thing for us, and for everyone in women's football, should be 'how can we make the women's game sustainable?'

“Commercially and attendance-wise, you have seen how much we have grown in a year. Playing at the London Stadium, we have had five weeks to sell that game and I think it just shows we want to do things quickly. We have always wanted to do things quickly.

“It is one of the most annoying things in the world when someone is like, ‘oh, can we wait a month’. Why? There is no point. We have jumped from the third division to the top division and that was fine, and we want to grow quickly but sustainably.”

West Ham average around 1,500 fans for their home games at Rush Green. The fixture against Tottenham will be a one-off at the London Stadium for this season but the hope is to attract more supporters to attend their games every week.

So how long will it be before women’s games are regularly being played at bigger venues?

“For everyone, I think that is the aim,” said Sullivan. ""But I am not sure when that will be.

“We have to get people through the door and then make sure Sunday is not a one-off game for them. It is about having them come once, enjoy it and then come to the next home game and start that cycle.

""We want to get as many people through the door and then hope people will come more often off the back of that.

“We do not want people to come just because it is at the London Stadium. It is all about getting them to come consistently. Not just focusing on these historic events, but an all-year-round thing.

“We have sold 900 season tickets this season and we are going to fill the best part of 20,000 for the game on Sunday, which shows people are interested in the women’s game. The more people you have coming to the games, the more sustainable the team becomes.”

West Ham have beaten Birmingham and lost to Arsenal and Chelsea so far in the WSL this season. They have ambitions of challenging the established elite and their game at the London Stadium is an important landmark for the club as it grows on and off the pitch.

“We know our team is good and if they perform to their maximum then we should be able to give everyone a good game,” said Sullivan.

“We have lost to Arsenal and Chelsea but both were close affairs. It is just continuing to push on, in all aspects on and off the pitch.

""How can we grow everything? How can we get more supporters coming here? Because that is how we think women’s football is going to become sustainable, by getting more people involved in women’s football.”",West Ham United Women look to forge their own London Stadium memories as Jack Sullivan aims for sustainability,sport,sport venue,803
747751,theindependent,"New fabrics being grown in laboratories may provide a viable alternative to the materials currently shedding vast quantities of plastic into the world’s oceans.

Synthetic textiles like polyester are durable replacements for natural fabrics like wool and cotton, but they also contribute to the trillions of microplastics filling the world’s oceans.

Concern has been growing about this form of pollution, which is known to be consumed by underwater wildlife with potentially harmful health effects.

These tiny shards of plastic come from many sources, but by far the most abundant variety is thought to be microfibres.

These fibres are produced in their thousands every time a piece of clothing is machine washed, and most are not trapped in filters as they flow through sewage systems.

Trillions or even quadrillions of these tiny shards are thought to have entered waterways and oceans already.

To tackle this problem, Dr Melik Demirel has been leading a project at Pennsylvania State University growing new fibres in large fermentation tanks using the same substances that make up natural materials.

“We are developing different types of protein-based fibres, similar to silk and wool and so on,” said Dr Demirel.

“The problem with synthetics is that they don’t adapt to the natural cycle, so they are not degradable,” he added.

“You need to come up with something that works with the cycles of nature, and the logical answer is to use the same building blocks as nature.”

If these “biosynthetic” materials were to shed fibres during the washing process, they would naturally break down in the water system with no harmful effects for wildlife.

Dr Demirel presented his work so far as part of a panel exploring solutions to the microplastic crisis at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) meeting.

Besides replacing plastic-based materials, he said he hoped to develop materials that can be used instead of fibres like cotton, which despite being natural can come with an enormous water and carbon footprint.

In a process similar to the creation of beer or yogurt, his “biosynthetic” fibres are created in fermentation tanks using bacteria and substances like corn syrup as the starting materials.

The next step is to scale this process up so that it can compete with the millions of tonnes of cotton and other textiles produced every year.

“We can make kilograms but we cannot make tonnes yet,” said Dr Demirel.

The Prime Minister's meeting was confirmed by Downing Street on Monday evening.

It will be Mrs May's final throw of the dice ahead of Tuesday's Commons vote on her Withdrawal Agreement.

The talks with Mr Juncker will be one last opportunity to secure legal assurances on the Irish backstop - and in doing so secure the vital support of hardline Tory Brexiteers and the DUP.

Ministers in the Irish cabinet were also summoned to an emergency government meeting on Brexit.

The Irish premier, Leo Varadkar, who was due to begin his journey to the US for St Patrick's Day, returned from Dublin airport and was brought back to government buildings for the cabinet briefing.

A government source confirmed the hastily-arranged meeting took place at 7pm on Monday night.

Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliment's Brexit coordinator, confirmed he and EP president Antonio Tajani will also meet Theresa May tonight.

He tweeted: ""Meeting with @theresa-may & @EP-President tonight. I hope progress can be made, if it is possible, as a no deal £Brexit would be a catastrophe. We will stand by Ireland & the need to safeguard the Good Friday Agreement.""

One of those Tory Brexiteers, Iain Duncan Smith, responded to the news by telling the BBC ""I think they are reaching the point where they are about to have some kind of agreement"".

However, he added his support - and that of the influential European Research Group - would be dependent on the verdict of its ""group of legal people"" which will pore over any proposal coming out of Strasbourg.

A statement to the Commons by Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay has been put back to about 10pm as a result of Mrs May's talks.

The negotiations are a boost for Number 10 after Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, said earlier on Monday there would be no more high-level backstop talks.

Mr Barnier had claimed the only talks that mattered were “between the Government in London and the Parliament in London”.

Mrs May had earlier ducked a demand from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to update the House of Commons on the progress of negotiations, sending Brexit minister Robin Walker to respond to his urgent question in her place.

If her deal is defeated on Tuesday, MPs will then vote on Wednesday whether to support a no-deal Brexit.

1093,abcnews,"As the Senate confirmation hearing got underway Tuesday for William Barr, President Donald Trump's nominee for attorney general, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin asked Barr if he's prepared to be at odds with the president, for a ""Mattis moment,"" a reference to former Secretary of Defense James Mattis' recent decision to resign over his disagreements with Trump.

Barr, who's 68, said while he might be intimidated a few years ago, he wouldn't be this late in his career.

""I have a very good life, I love it -- but I also want to help in this circumstance and I am not going to do anything I think is wrong, and I will not be bullied into doing something that I think is wrong, by anybody"" including Congress or the president, Barr said.

Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, >, Barr is facing tough questions from Democrats over his views on special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and a memo that Barr wrote in June 2018 opposing an obstruction of justice case against the president.

Analyzing the president's firing of then-FBI director James Comey in May 2017, Barr argued in the memo to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that any obstruction of justice inquiry into Trump based on the firing would be ""fatally misconceived.""

Barr knows the Justice Department from his time as attorney general under President George H. W. Bush. And while Democrats acknowledge his previous experience, many insist the current situation is unprecedented, and have been in lockstep demanding assurances from Barr that the Mueller report be made public and that he not interfere or limit the special counsel.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has gone so far as to call on Trump to rescind Barr's nomination based on the memo.

""I wrote the memo as a former Attorney General who has often weighed in on legal issues of public importance, and I distributed it broadly so that other lawyers would have the benefit of my views,"" Barr said in his opening statement.

""As I explained in a recent letter to Ranking Member Feinstein, my memo was narrow in scope, explaining my thinking on a specific obstruction-of-justice theory under a single statute that I thought, based on media reports, the Special Counsel might be considering. The memo did not address -- or in any way question -- the Special Counsel's core investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election,"" Barr continued. ""Nor did it address other potential obstruction-of-justice theories or argue, as some have erroneously suggested, that a President can never obstruct justice. I wrote it myself, on my own initiative, without assistance, and based solely on public information.""

Barr also sought to reassure Democrats he thinks Mueller should be allowed to finish his work, unhappy over Trump's appointment of Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker whom they suspected was named to block Mueller's investigation.

""I believe it is in the best interest of everyone -- the President, Congress, and, most importantly, the American people -- that this matter be resolved by allowing the Special Counsel to complete his work. The country needs a credible resolution of these issues. If confirmed, I will not permit partisan politics, personal interests, or any other improper consideration to interfere with this or any other investigation,"" Barr's said.

""Second, I also believe it is very important that the public and Congress be informed of the results of the Special Counsel's work. For that reason, my goal will be to provide as much transparency as I can consistent with the law. I can assure you that, where judgments are to be made by me, I will make those judgments based solely on the law and will let no personal, political, or other improper interests influence my decision.""

""President Trump has sought no assurances, promises, or commitments from me of any kind, either express or implied, and I have not given him any, other than that I would run the Department with professionalism and integrity,"" Barr said. ""As Attorney General, my allegiance will be to the rule of law, the Constitution, and the American people. That is how it should be. That is how it must be. And, if you confirm me, that is how it will be.""

Barr said Mueller would never go on a ""witch hunt"" -- what the president has repeatedly called the special counsel's investigation.

However, some decisions that could impact the release of Mueller's findings, such as whether the White House will assert any type of executive privilege, would not rest with Barr.

Mueller and Barr worked together in the early 1990s when Barr was Attorney General and Mueller was the head of the DOJ's Criminal Division.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the Judiciary Committee's new chairman, said Mueller and Barr are ""best friends"" and have known each other for more than 20 years, adding that their wives have been in a Bible study group together and that Mueller has attended the weddings of two of Barr's daughters.

At Graham's request, former Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican and long-serving member of the Judiciary Committee, introduced Barr Tuesday as he did for Barr's previous confirmation hearings.

Barr, meanwhile, outlined his friendship with Mueller.

""I have known Bob Mueller personally and professionally for 30 years. We worked closely together throughout my previous tenure at the Department of Justice under President Bush. We've been friends since. I have the utmost respect for Bob and his distinguished record of public service. When he was named special counsel, I said that his selection was 'good news' and that, knowing him, I had confidence he would handle the matter properly. I still have that confidence today,"" Barr said.

Barr also said his priorities at the Justice Department are fighting violent crime, prosecuting hate crimes, enforcing and improving immigration laws and protecting the right to vote.

553295,sputnik,"According to experts, today, the most common base for theoretical research in physics is the idea that, apart from the well-known three spatial and temporal dimensions, there are some extra ones. It is assumed that the size of the extra dimensions is so small that they can’t be detected with modern equipment.

Scientists at NRNU MEPhI, together with their colleagues from Kazan Federal University, have studied why the Universe has grown to gigantic size, while the sub-spaces remained microscopic. The study was based on the Big Bang theory, which resulted in the creation of our world as well as the Universe growing.

According to Rubin, the scientists will study the role of extra dimensions in the observed physical phenomena and in the early Universe, as well as study whether the size and shape of extra dimensions are the same in different areas of space.

Successive restoration of this shape is a difficult task, which will take more than a dozen years to resolve.

The scientists emphasised that, like all basic research, the study is an attempt to obtain new knowledge that will be used in the future to preserve civilization in the Universe, which is gradually cooling after the Big Bang.

275836,ipolitics,"Kevin Hua, the NDP candidate for Carleton, is looking to become the youngest-ever representative elected to the House of Commons. Photo by Charlie Pinkerton/iPolitics

It’s at almost the half-an-hour mark into an interview when Kevin Hua is posed with the question, “How did this government let you down?”

“How long do we have?” quips back the 18-year-old.

More pointedly, Hua says it’s the Trudeau government’s failure to live up to its promise to deliver electoral reform and do away with the first-past-the-post electoral system, as well as what he deems as the government’s failure to effectively address climate change in Canada. That’s part of what’ll drive him to vote for the first time ever in this election for his NDP candidate: himself.

As the NDP’s representative for Carleton, Hua will be (at least) one the youngest contestants’ whose name will be on a ballot in the federal election this fall (the NDP did not get back to an iPolitics request for a list of its similarly aged candidates). And to succeed in becoming the Baby of the House (a moniker unofficially given to the youngest MP in the Chamber), Hua will have to unseat Conservative mainstay and former cabinet minister Pierre Poilievre, who is in his 16th year of sitting in the House after he was elected for the first time at just 25 years old.

Though he only reached voting age in April, Hua’s not a rookie to the political arena.

An overachiever in school, specifically the social sciences, he points out, Hua’s interest in politics drew him online, which led him to connect with the NDP. He was led to the NDP by participating in House of Commons-styled simulations on social media site Reddit.

“The (simulations) tried to emulate Parliament as close as they possibly could – standing orders, everything; everything is emulated to be as close as possible, so people can create bills, they debate on the bills, there are political parties, there’s even elections to decide on who gets into parliament,” Hua told iPolitics in an interview in July.

From there, Hua became involved with Courtney Potter’s campaign in last year’s provincial election, volunteering by canvassing Carleton on her behalf.

Hua says he has a “professional relationship” with one-time baby of the House Pierre-Luc Dusseault, who was elected to the House of Commons as part of the NDP’s “Orange Wave” in Quebec in the 2011 federal election. Hua would take Dusseault’s record as the youngest MP ever if he could pull off an upset against Poilievre, which is a task that’s difficulty would be tough to overstate.

A representative of the NDP has never won the riding. The party’s candidate came in a distant third place to Poilievre and Liberal candidate Chris Rodgers in the 2015 election (Rodgers is again the Liberal candidate in the upcoming election). Poilievre had won the seat in each of the three previous elections with more than 50 per cent of the vote. In his first try at being elected in 2004, Poilievre unseated David Pratt, who had been a cabinet minister of the incumbent Liberals.

But winning, Hua says, isn’t his only reason for running.

“It’s about winning, if possible, but it’s also about that option – that option has to be available to the voters that if they want to choose, not the Liberals, not the Conservatives, not the Greens, or if they legitimately want to vote for policies that the NDP hold, they have that option,” Hua said.

In case that isn’t the result, Hua will have already begun his next politically-involved pursuit as a first year student in Carleton University’s bachelor of public affairs and policy management program. But if need be, he’d be happy to put those plans on hold.

And for what he wants voters to take of his claim as perhaps this election’s youngest candidate: “Don’t look at my age.”

“Listen to what I have to what I have to say,” Hua says, adding later, “and watch out for me in the riding.”",18-year-old NDP candidate facing tough task in bid to become Baby of the House,science and technology,social sciences,653

FIFA said in a statement on October 11 that Sayed Aghazada was guilty of ""various violations"" of the FIFA Code of Ethics for failing to report sexual-abuse complaints lodged by several Afghan female soccer players against Keramuudin Karim, the former president of the AFF.

""In its decision, the adjudicatory chamber ruled that Mr. Aghazada was aware of this abuse and had the duty to report and prevent it according to the FIFA Code of Ethics,"" the statement said.

Karim was banned for life in June following a FIFA investigation that found him guilty of having abused his position and for sexually abusing ""various female players.""

In addition to a ban from all soccer-related activity at both the national and international level for five years, Aghazada was also fined 10,000 Swiss francs ($10,016), FIFA said.

785937,theirishtimes,"Scientists are expected to unveil next Wednesday the first photograph of a black hole, a breakthrough in astrophysics providing insight into celestial monsters with gravitational fields so intense no matter or light can escape.

The US National Science Foundation has scheduled a news conference in Washington to announce a “groundbreaking result from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project,” an international partnership formed in 2012 to try to directly observe the immediate environment of a black hole.

Simultaneous news conferences are scheduled in Brussels, Santiago, Shanghai, Taipei and Tokyo.

A black hole’s event horizon, one of the most violent places in the universe, is the point of no return beyond which anything - stars, planets, gas, dust, all forms of electromagnetic radiation including light - gets sucked in irretrievably.

While scientists involved in the research declined to disclose the findings ahead of the formal announcement, they are clear about their goals.

“It’s a visionary project to take the first photograph of a black hole. We are a collaboration of over 200 people internationally,” astrophysicist Sheperd Doeleman, director of the Event Horizon Telescope at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian, said at a March event in Texas.

The news conference is scheduled for 9am (2pm local time) on Wednesday.

The research will put to the test a scientific pillar - physicist Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity, according to University of Arizona astrophysicist Dimitrios Psaltis, project scientist for the Event Horizon Telescope. That theory, put forward in 1915, was intended to explain the laws of gravity and their relation to other natural forces.

The first - called Sagittarius A* - is situated at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy, possessing 4 million times the mass of our sun and located 26,000 light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).

The second - called M87 - resides at the center of the neighboring Virgo A galaxy, boasting a mass 3.5 billion times that of the sun and located 54 million light-years away from Earth. Streaming away from M87 at nearly the speed of light is a humongous jet of subatomic particles.

Black holes, coming in a variety of sizes, are dense entities formed when large stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. Supermassive black holes are the largest kind, devouring matter and radiation and perhaps merging with other black holes.

Psaltis described a black hole as “an extreme warp in spacetime,” a term referring to the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time joined into a single four-dimensional continuum.

Doeleman said the project’s researchers obtained the first data in April 2017 from a global network of telescopes. The telescopes that collected that initial data are located in the US states of Arizona and Hawaii as well as Mexico, Chile, Spain and Antarctica. Since then, telescopes in France and Greenland have been added to the network.

The scientists also will be trying to detect for the first time the dynamics near the black hole as matter orbits at near light speeds before being swallowed into oblivion.

The fact that black holes do not allow light to escape makes viewing them difficult. The scientists will be looking for a ring of light - radiation and matter circling at tremendous speed at the edge of the event horizon - around a region of darkness representing the actual black hole. This is known as the black hole’s shadow or silhouette.

Einstein’s theory, if correct, should allow for an extremely accurate prediction of the size and shape of a black hole.

“The shape of the shadow will be almost a perfect circle in Einstein’s theory,” Psaltis said. “If we find it to be different than what the theory predicts, then we go back to square one and we say, ‘Clearly, something is not exactly right.’” –Reuters",First photo of black hole expected in astrophysics milestone,science and technology,natural science,633
711499,theguardianuk,"German authorities are investigating a man who drove a stolen lorry into a line of cars in Limburg in the western state of Hesse, injuring eight people.

The 32-year-old had pulled the driver of the vehicle from his cabin at a red light before using the lorry to plough into eight cars waiting at a light near the town’s central railway station at about 5.20pm (1620 BST) on Monday.

The man, a Syrian national named as Omar AI by the national broadcaster ARD, was arrested at the scene.

Germany has been on alert following several jihadi attacks in recent years claimed by Islamic State. The most deadly was committed in 2016 by a 23-year-old Tunisian, who killed 12 people when he stole a truck and ploughed it through a Berlin Christmas market.

A number of German media outlets, citing security sources, reported that authorities believed Monday’s incident to have a terrorist background. However, a spokesperson for the general public prosecutor in Frankfurt said they could not confirm a terrorist motive and were still investigating the case.

According to the news agency dpa, the suspect has lived in Germany since 2015 and was known to the police for a number of minor criminal offences including possession of drugs and theft.

However, he had no known links to Islamist extremist circles.

The Hesse state interior minister Peter Beuth urged people not to jump to conclusions. “Although the events recall the horrible attacks in Nice and Berlin, the motive of the detained man remains unclear,” he said.

Marius Hahn, the mayor of Limburg, said he was shocked by the incident. “My thoughts are with the injured victims of the accident and their families,” he said.",Eight injured as stolen lorry crashes into cars in Germany,"disaster, accident and emergency incident",emergency incident,274

According to a Harris Poll of 2,035 adults, conducted Feb. 21–25, 2019 and provided to Axios, two-thirds of all Americans agree that the government should provide universal health care, compared to 73.2% of Millennial and Generation Z respondents.

But, when asked in the same survey if the government should allow private insurance, more than three-fourths of Millennials and Generation Z respondents agreed, as did nearly nine in ten of all respondents.

1884,abcnews,"McDonald's chief executive officer has been pushed out of the company after violating company policy by engaging in a consensual relationship with an employee, the corporation said Sunday.

The fast food giant said former president and CEO Steve Easterbrook demonstrated poor judgment, and that McDonald's forbids managers from having romantic relationships with direct or indirect subordinates.

In an email to employees, Easterbrook acknowledged he had a relationship with an employee and said it was a mistake.

""Given the values of the company, I agree with the board that it is time for me to move on,"" Easterbrook said in the email.

McDonald's board of directors voted on Easterbrook's departure Friday after conducting a thorough review. Details of Easterbrook's separation package will be released Monday in a federal filing, according to a company spokesman. He will also be leaving the company's board. Easterbrook was CEO since 2015.

McDonald's would not provide details about the employee with whom Easterbrook was involved, and an attorney for Easterbrook declined to answer questions.

The board of directors named Chris Kempczinski, who recently served as president of McDonald's USA, as its new president and CEO.

Two weeks ago, McDonald's reported a 2% drop in net income for the third quarter as it spent heavily on store remodeling and expanded delivery service. The company's share price has dropped 7.5% since, though it's still up 9.2% for the year. The burger chain also has been plagued by declining restaurant traffic.

The leadership transition is unrelated to the company's operational or financial performance, the company said in a news release.

McDonald's decision to act may be a sign of progress on workplace issues that have come to light in the #MeToo era, said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond.

""Other companies don't always act on that kind of information or fire their CEO for that, and so it seems like they trying to enforce a pretty strict policy in this situation,"" Tobias said.

Among other challenges at its restaurants, McDonald's has faced workplace harassment charges. In May, McDonald's said it was enhancing training and offering a new hotline for workers after a labor group filed dozens of sexual harassment charges against the company.

Fight for $15, the group which filed the charges, said McDonald's response to its sexual harassment complaints has been inadequate, and ""the company needs to be completely transparent about Easterbrook's firing and any other executive departures related to these issues.""

Kempczinski joined McDonald's in 2015. He was responsible for approximately 14,000 McDonald's restaurants in the U.S. He was instrumental in the development of McDonald's strategic plan and oversaw the most comprehensive transformation of the U.S. business in McDonald's history, said Enrique Hernandez, chairman of McDonald's board, in a statement.",McDonald's CEO pushed out after relationship with employee,labour,labour relations,444

You’ve heard of Mad Cow Disease, the scientific name of which is bovine spongiform encephalopathy — a type of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs).

TSE is an incurable fatal disease that affects the brain and nervous system of many animals, including humans. Autopsies of infected brain tissue show a myriad of tiny holes in the cortex, giving it a sponge-like appearance — hence spongiform.  (See below)

The disorder causes impairment of brain and bodily functions, including memory changes, personality changes, and problems with movement (shaking, trembling) that worsen over time.

Like all TSEs, the bovine variant is transmitted via prions (a type of protein) instead of via bacteria or viruses. The prions come from the tissue of a TSE-infected cow which was ingested by another cow. The corporate meat industry actually mix cow tissue in the food that’s fed to cows. Yuck!

When humans eat TSE-infected beef, they develop a type of TSE called Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease.

But there is another form of human TSE called Kuru that is caused by humans ingesting TSE-infected human tissue. In other words, Kuru is the result of cannibalism.

Kuru was first identified in 1961 among the Fore tribe in Papua New Guinea. Research suggested that the epidemic may have originated around 1900 from a single individual who lived on the edge of Fore territory and who is thought to have spontaneously developed some form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. From that infected individual, Kuru spread easily and rapidly in the Fore people due to their endocannibalistic funeral practices, in which relatives consumed the bodies of their dead, especially the brain tissue where prions are concentrated,  to return the “life force” of the deceased to the hamlet. By the mid-1960s, Kuru was in decline among the Fore due to Australian colonial law forbidding cannibalism, as well as the efforts of local Christian missionaries. But cases continued to appear for several more decades because the mean incubation (asymptomatic) phase of the disease is 14 years after initial exposure, although cases were reported with latencies of 40 years or more. The clinical (symptomatic) phase of the disease lasts an average of 12 months, before the infected person dies.

The last sufferer in Papua New Guinea died in 2005. Little did the world know that Kuru would make its reappearance thousands of miles from Papua New Guinea — among Muslim “rebels” in civil war-torn Syria.

In April of this year, Time magazine obtained a video that had been smuggled out of Syria by a “rebel fighter.” Aryn Baker writes for Time magazine, May 12, 2013:

In the video a man who is believed to be a rebel commander named Khalid al-Hamad, who goes by the nom de guerre Abu Sakkar, bends over the government soldier, knife in hand. With his right hand he moves what appears to be the dead man’s heart onto a flat piece of wood or metal lying across the body. With his left hand he pulls what appears to be a lung across the open cavity in the man’s chest. According to two of Abu Sakkar’s fellow rebels, who said they were present at the scene, Abu Sakkar had cut the organs out of the man’s body. The man believed to be Abu Sakkar then works his knife through the flesh of the dead man’s torso before he stands to face the camera, holding an organ in each hand. “I swear we will eat from your hearts and livers, you dogs of Bashar,” he says, referring to supporters of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Off camera, a small crowd can be heard calling out “Allahu akbar” — God is great. Then the man raises one of the bloodied organs to his lips and starts to tear off a chunk with his teeth.

Two TIME reporters first saw the video in April in the presence of several of Abu Sakkar’s fighters and supporters, including his brother. They all said the video was authentic. We later obtained a copy. […] These 27 seconds of footage provide a glimpse at how brutal the Syrian war has become….

Walid Theodore Shoebat, a former member of the radical Muslim Brotherhood but now a truth-telling peace activist, writes in his blog that Kuru has been found in 8 to 20 people in war-torn Syria, and the only way it could have come about, doctors confirmed, is through cannibalism and the consumption of human brain,as first reported by Arabian news source Zaman al-Wasal and substantiated by Orient News Television.

Two of the infected were sent from Syria to a hospital in Ghazi Antab in Turkey for further examination, then transferred to another hospital in Germany. One of the two was confirmed to have eaten human flesh, and he eventually died.

Shoebat has written extensively on Islamic cannibalism, which can be found here, here, here, and here.

The asymptomatic incubation phase of Kuru is between 5 to 20 years following initial exposure, with the average being 12 years. But the Syrian civil war began in 2011. This suggests that the Kuru of the infected Syrian men would have been transmitted BEFORE the civil war.

Such is the Religion of Peace!

717057,theguardianuk,"Nearly one in five school buildings in England require urgent repairs, a Guardian investigation has found, leading to warnings that they are “crumbling around teachers and pupils”.

Almost 4,000 schools across the country have been judged by surveyors to be in need of immediate restoration work, and many more were found not to have the paperwork required by law, including electrical test certificates, fire risk assessments or asbestos management plans.

According to data gathered through a government programme to assess the condition of England’s schools estate, 17% (3,731) were found to have buildings with “elements”, such as a roof, wall or window deemed in need of immediate replacement or repair.

Of the 21,796 schools for which information was released, 1,313 had elements that were given the worst possible condition grade D, defined as “life expired and/or serious risk of imminent failure”. Seven hundred and five schools had more than two elements awarded a grade D, while 69 had more than 10.

The data, which was obtained though freedom of information requests, were gathered through the Department for Education’s school condition data collection (CDC) programme, launched in early 2017. As part of the scheme, surveyors visited every government-maintained school in England to collect data about the physical condition of school buildings and how they are managed.

Schools were also asked to fill in a survey before the surveyor’s visit to provide information about its buildings. According to FOI data, 2,939 schools – 14% of the 20,854 respondents – did not have an asbestos management plan; 2,717 (13%) did not have a fire risk assessment; 2,215 (11%) did not have a gas safety test report; and 2,098 (10%) did not have an electrical test certificate.

The Department for Education (DfE) said that in some cases the documentation could have been held off-site by the multiacademy trust managing the school. However, a spokesperson for the National Education Union (NEU) said such paperwork was pointless if it was not held within the building it related to for staff to refer to.

Critics said the findings pointed to a system in which overstretched school leaders were struggling to keep their buildings safe after years of budget cuts. Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the NEU, said the figures highlighted the effect of failure to invest in a crumbling educational infrastructure and that teachers, other staff and pupils deserved better.

He added: “It makes no sense for important practical documents, required by law, not to be held on the premises of a school or college. The reason the government gives – that they may be held by a multi-academy trust would be laughable if it weren’t so serious. If they are missing how can the risk be safely managed?”

Teachers across England told the Guardian they were having to work in buildings so cold they had to keep their coats on, with damp walls and infestations of vermin. One teacher in a primary school in Teesside said she worked in a 26-year-old portable building with windows that would not open and others that would not close.

“There is a horrendous cold draft, so I often have to sit with my coat on with the children coming in,” she said. “We had to shut for a week last year because of a massive rat infestation.”

She helped to fix a leak in her classroom because the school could not afford to call a plumber. “I know the state of the school budget and I know that lots of schools in the area have faced restructuring and redundancies and I don’t want us to become one of them,” she added.

Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said schools across the country were in dire need of repair, but the funding was not available. “That failure to invest has left our children and hard working school staff at risk, trying to teach in buildings that are crumbling around them,” she said. Labour has pledged to spend £7bn on repairs and upgrades to school buildings in England.

Upon arriving in office in 2010, the Conservatives scrapped the previous Labour government’s Building Schools for the Future scheme, a £55bn programme to rebuild every secondary school in England. By 2017, the National Audit Office (NAO) warned the condition of schools was worsening, with about 40% of the schools estate built between 1945 and 1976 coming up for replacement or major refurbishment.

The NAO estimated it would cost £6.7bn to bring existing school buildings up to a satisfactory standard, a figure that was expected to double over the course of five years to 2020-21.

In a survey conducted by the NEU last month, 47% of members said the school or college buildings they worked in were not fit for purpose, with 65% blaming funding cuts. Twenty-two per cent said the condition of the buildings had lead to an unsafe environment for pupils and staff.

The issue of health and safety in schools was highlighted in July when the Guardian revealed that nearly 700 had been referred to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) over concerns they were failing to safely manage asbestos in their buildings.

Lucie Stephens has campaigned for asbestos to be removed from school buildings since her mother, Sue, a former teacher, died of the asbestos-caused cancer mesothelioma in 2016. She said the discovery that more than one in 10 schools did not have the legally required documents on site was horrifying.

Stephens has launched a website that aims to show parents and pupils that schools contain asbestos, but has accused the DfE of a lack of transparency for refusing to release the necessary data. The HSE advises that asbestos is only a risk if it is disturbed or damaged, which releases fibres into the air.

Responding to the findings, the schools minister Nick Gibb said: “The Conservative government provides money annually to improve the condition of school buildings. In this academic year, over £1bn has been made available. We also recently announced a £400m fund for schools to improve their buildings.

“A Conservative majority government would build on that record with £14bn over the next three years, and by increasing the minimum level of per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools.”",Revealed: one in five school buildings in England require urgent repairs,education,school,1013

Rebecca Brady, nine, donated £222 to the play scheme after she and her two brothers – Jack, 13, and four-year-old Calum – saved their spare change over several months.

The trio normally spend their savings while on holiday, but this week handed much of it over to Project 31 which has brought them joy for years.

The charity, which provides organised play activities throughout Rutherglen and Cambuslang, proved especially valuable to the Brady family in 2018 as Rebecca was struggling with her confidence.

Her mum Donna Brady said: “Last year Rebecca had a lot of anxiety and confidence issues.

“She had been working through that and Project 31 really helped her.

“The Young People’s Park is an event where the children go independently [from their parents] with Project 31 workers at Cambuslang Park.

“They do forest school things, team work, learn new skills and it really helps things like anxiety. Rebecca has come on so much, I can’t believe the difference in her. Friends and family are commenting so much on how she is coming out of her shell.”

Donna added: “Lorna Bamford and Elizabeth Dewar at Project 31 – Rebecca thinks they are absolutely wonderful. They are great role models for her.

“She wants to volunteer and become a member of staff when she is older. She is hoping to volunteer soon and pass on what they have taught her.”

Explaining that Rebecca and her brother Jack were amongst the first children to attend project 31 events when the scheme started in 2011, Donna says that the team of staff and volunteers are incredible at looking at each child’s needs at their activities.

She takes all three children to sessions for the whole family and says her children wanted to “give back” to an organisation that has been so supportive of them.

Donna added: “We saved pennies, five and 10 pences all last year.

They usually take that on holiday with them, but they kept some back, adding to it, and family members helped with the donation too.

Delighted Lorna Bamford, project manager of Project 31, said: “We always feel very lucky when we receive donations to the project, but this is a very special one indeed!

“The brilliant Rebecca, who was one of our first ever Project 31ers, her brothers Calum and Jack and their family have been saving their pennies for us since last March.

“We can’t tell you how much this is appreciated or how much such kindness means.

“Funding is a constant challenge and takes up far more of our time and energy than we would like it to, so donations like this really are amazing.”

210906,foxnews,"President Trump might as well stick his tweet Friday morning on a campaign bumper sticker: ""JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!""

The social media declaration came as the Labor Department reported robust new economic numbers, saying employers added 263,000 jobs in April as the unemployment rate dropped to a 49-year low.

The stats only bolstered the president's economy-focused message as he gears up for what is sure to be a grueling 2020 re-election fight. As Democrats increasingly make the election about the president's character and controversies, the string of positive jobs reports are complicating any efforts to expand that message to run on more traditional kitchen-table issues.

""I'll be running on the economy,"" Trump said flatly, speaking to reporters at the White House Friday.

Trump's campaign was quick to tout the numbers as well, with press secretary Kayleigh McEnany declaring ""the era of low expectations for American workers and their families is long over thanks to the Trump economy.""

She added in a statement, ""With this kind of momentum, we look forward to hearing the economic plans of the Democrats as they spin tales about Americans not feeling the results of the Trump economy, when in fact workers everywhere can feel the boom!”

The unemployment rate fell to 3.6 percent with the latest report. While part of that drop was due to an increased number of Americans who've stopped looking for work, the jobless rate is at its lowest level since 1969.

Also of note: the average hourly pay for workers jumped 3.2 percent from a year ago, which is considered a very healthy increase by economists.

The new numbers appear to put to rest fears earlier this year that the economy was heading toward recession. And they extend the nation's nearly decade-long recovery from the Great Recession. That economic recovery, which started during then-President Barack Obama's administration, is expected to become the longest in the nation's history come July.

The president touted on Twitter that ""we can all agree that AMERICA is now #1. We are the ENVY of the WORLD — and the best is yet to come!"" as he re-tweeted a Drudge Report headline that read ""ENVY OF THE WORD. UNEMPLOYMENT 49-YEAR LOW.""

While Trump spotlighted the new economic report, the news appears to make it a tougher sell for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination contenders on the economy, which remains a leading issue for voters.

Many of the leading Democratic presidential candidates passed on reacting to the Labor Department's report.

But former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, taking aim at Trump, argued that ""nobody should be beating their chest over that ... We've got a long way to go.""

Hickenlooper, speaking with Fox News in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire before unveiling his own plans to boost the economy, admitted that ""certainly we're making progress and that's great."" But he added, ""is it fast enough for most Americans? I don't think so.""

McEnany boasted that ""the new jobs report is further proof that the Trump economy continues to boom and deliver benefits that all Americans are feeling.""

Her statement was an implicit shot at many of the leading Democratic contenders, who've continuously slammed the president as they argue the Trump tax cuts and the economic recovery have only benefited the wealthy and large corporations.

""The middle class is hurting, it’s hurting now,” former Vice President Joe Biden declared on Monday in Pittsburgh, as he delivered the first speech of his newly declared White House bid.

“The stock market is roaring. But you don’t feel it. There was a $2 trillion tax cut last year. Did you feel it? Did you get anything from it?” Biden asked, as the audience packed into a union hall chanted, ""No.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a top rival for the Democratic nomination, wrote in an opinion piece for Fox News last month that ""in America today, we have more wealth and income inequality than any other major country on Earth and it is worse now than at any other time since the 1920s.""

And the independent senator from Vermont, who's making his second straight White House run, vowed to fight for ""an economy that expands the middle class and reduces poverty and not one that makes the very rich much richer.""

Another progressive contender for the nomination, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, repeatedly spotlights that the 2020 election ""is our chance to dream big, to fight hard, and to make this an America that works not just for the rich and the powerful but an America that works for everyone.”

Veteran New Hampshire-based political scientist Wayne Lesperance said that ""challengers to the president are working hard to craft a narrative that elevates their stature and defines the president as not deserving a second term. Part of the strategy is to reframe the president’s strengths as illegitimate.""

Lesperance, vice president of academic affairs at New England College, stressed that ""the fact is economic growth and job creation are stronger than expected and impact all Americans positively.""

""Harry Truman’s famous maxim that the buck stops here is as true in good economic times as bad. President Trump is the beneficiary of a surprisingly strong and growing economy. And if the past is prologue, American voters will reward the president as they continue to vote with their pocketbooks,"" he added.

The release of the report comes just two days after a new national poll by CNN indicated Trump had hit a new high on his economic approval ratings, with 56 percent of those questioned saying the president's doing a good job on the economy. CNN's polling, though, also showed numerous Democratic candidates including Sanders, Biden and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke beating Trump in head-to-head matchups.

While there's plenty for Trump to brag about and a good narrative for him to tell, there's no guarantee he'll stay on message. Republicans in Congress urged the president to spotlight the economy and the tax cuts during the 2018 midterm elections, but he often drifted to other issues as he stumped for GOP candidates.

Some pundits question whether the 2020 election will see an electorate focused on the economy, or on values.

White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney thinks the economy will win out over all the controversies that have consumed the Trump presidency.

Spelling out the president's 2020 economic message, Mulvaney on Tuesday suggested voters would still be willing to support Trump at the ballot box even if they don't like him personally.

""You hate to sound like a cliché, but are you better off than you were four years ago? It's pretty simple, right? It's the economy, stupid. I think that's easy. People will vote for somebody they don't like if they think it's good for them,"" Mulvaney said as he spoke at the Milken conference in Los Angeles.",Surging economy complicates Dems’ 2020 message against Trump,"economy, business and finance",economy,1088
218608,freebeacon,"Presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) says the burden should be on parents to fix public education, urging parents who want options beyond failing schools to pay for improvements and services themselves.

""If you think your public school is not working, then go help your public school. Go get more resources for it,"" Warren said in an interview with labor giant National Education Association (NEA). ""Volunteer at your public schools. Help get the teachers and school bus drivers and cafeteria workers and the custodial staff and the support staff, help get them some support so they can do the work that needs to be done. You don't like the building? You think it's old and decaying? Then get out there and push to get a new one.""

Warren's comments are at odds with her past support for school vouchers for children in failing schools, a position she advanced before she became an elected official. She has received more than $2.5 million in campaign donations from the education industry throughout her political career, including nearly $70,000 from the teachers' unions.

Warren's comments to the NEA follow a recent revelation that the senator sent her son to a private school rather than public. Though Warren's daughter attended public school for the entirety of her K-12 education, her son attended multiple elite private schools beginning in fifth grade.

Warren has received backlash from some minority voters over her opposition to charter schools. Pro-school choice activists interrupted her recent campaign event in Atlanta, telling the Massachusetts senator, ""We want the same choice for our kids that you had for your kids.""

Warren sent her son to the Haverford School, an all-boys college preparatory school in suburban Philadelphia, for six years. Her son graduated from the school, which now costs $39,500 a year, in 1994. Warren's son also attended the Kirby Hall School, a private college preparatory school in Austin, Texas, as a fifth grader in 1986.

The Warren campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

During the NEA interview, Warren touted her opposition to a 2016 ballot initiative that would have expanded charter schools in Massachusetts. While Warren sides with the nation's most powerful teachers' unions on the issue of school choice, charter schools in urban Massachusetts have proved extremely successful, benefitting the same disadvantaged groups Warren claims to fight for.

A 2015 study by Stanford University's CREDO institute found that urban charter schools ""provide significantly higher levels of annual growth in both math and reading"" that are ""larger by significant amounts for black, Hispanic, low-income, and special education students."" A Brookings Institution study of charter schools in Massachusetts mirrored these findings. Researchers found that urban charter schools in the state produce educational outcomes ""far better than those of the traditional public schools that charter students would otherwise attend.""

Despite the positive impact of charter schools on Warren's urban constituents, the Massachusetts senator was proud to detail her opposition to charter school expansion in the state, saying she ""fought on the side of the educators"" to ""beat back a well-funded effort."" Though Warren claimed the ballot initiative aimed to ""lift the cap on charter schools and expand the number of charters across the state,"" the initiative only impacted low-performing districts that hit their caps for charter school attendees.

Warren previously supported a voucher system that would allow parents to choose the school their children could attend. The then-Harvard professor wrote in her book, The Two-Income Trap, that ""with fully funded vouchers, parents of all income levels could send their children—and the accompanying financial support—to the schools of their choice."" Warren references the book in her NEA interview, claiming she ""argued in that book that what we need to do is find another school assignment process where every dollar stays in the public schools."" This assessment fails to recognize tuition-free charter schools as a public option, a common union characterization.

Warren reversed her support for a voucher system when she launched her presidential campaign, releasing an education plan that calls for the ""aggressive oversight"" of charter schools and vows to eliminate federal funding for charter school expansion. Warren's plan aligns her with the nation's most powerful teachers' unions, an alliance she reaffirmed in the NEA interview.

""For me, having a union, a strong union, making sure that it is easy to join a union, that unions have more power when they negotiate, is a central part in both making sure that we have strong public schools, and frankly, making sure that we have a strong economy overall,"" Warren said.",Warren to Parents: You Fix the Public Schools,education,school,745

The joyous occasion, which means ""Festival of Breaking the Fast"", is celebrated for three days as it marks the end of Ramadan and its month-long fast.

One popular tradition sees Muslims enjoy a large meal following the fasting period, and along with the celebration the festival is also a time for forgiveness and making amends.

During this time, well-wishers often greet each other by saying ""Eid Murbarak"" - which means ""happy holiday"".

With Ramadan currently underway, here's everything you need to know about Eid al-Fitr.

Eid al-Fitr is celebrated at the end of Ramadan, but because the Islamic calendar is lunar the date will vary depending on the moon.

This year Ramadan began on the evening of Sunday May 5, which means Eid al-Fitr will is expected to begin on Tuesday, June 4.

Eid-al-Fitr typically lasts for one, two or three days.

The first Eid al-Fitr was celebrated by Prophet Muhammed with friends and relatives after the victory of the battle of Jang-e-Badr.

To many Muslims, Eid al-Fitr is an important show of gratitude to Allah for the help and strength he gave them throughout the previous fasting month to help them practice self-control.

A celebration that marks the end of Ramadan and the 30 days of fasting, Eid al-Fitr is an important religious holiday that is celebrated by Muslims worlwide.

During Eid al-Fitr, most Muslims will visit a mosque and participate in prayer before sitting down with family and friends for their first daylight meal after fasting.

Another Eid al-Fitr tradition is known as ‘Zakat al-Fitr,’ which is the practice of giving money to the poor so those less fortunate can join in the feast.",Eid 2019 UK: How do Muslims celebrate Eid al-Fitr? When does Ramadan end?,religion and belief,religious event,280

A total of 125 red flood warnings and a further 118 amber flood alerts stretch from Sunderland in the north to the Isle of Wight in the south.

The flash flooding caused by torrential downpours is expected to spark more misery for commuters and residents.

Five 'severe' warnings are active and relate to towns and villages surrounding the River Don which are in immediate risk.

The river in Doncaster burst its banks yesterday and will reach its highest recorded level today, forecasters predict.

Areas such as Barnby Dun, Kirk Bramwith, Kirk Sandall, South Bramwith and Willow Bridge Caravan Site will receive severe flooding.

Doncaster Council has warned some residents to evacuate their homes because the River Don is breaching its banks near St Oswald Church at Kirk Sandall.

The council tweeted: “There is a Severe Flood Warning in place for Sandal Grove, Old Kirk Sandall.

“Residents in these areas are advised to evacuate immediately.”

Northern Rail said that, due to heavy flooding, there would be “severe disruption” to their network.

Train operators are warning passengers not to travel on a number of routes through Yorkshire and the North West.

This includes lines from Sheffield to destinations such as Leeds via Moorthorpe, Lincoln, Doncaster and Goole.

Trains are also unable to run on routes such as Manchester Piccadilly-Cleethorpes, Leeds-Doncaster and Hebden Bridge-Rochdale.

Rail replacement bus services are not being provided due to road closures and unsafe driving conditions.

Network Rail, which owns Britain's rail infrastructure, said track inspections will take place ""where possible"".

Rail firm Northern warned that disruption could continue into the weekend despite the weather improving in many areas.

A spokesman said: ""We are still advising customers on several routes not to travel as flooding is making rail and road travel extremely difficult.

""Colleagues at Network Rail are inspecting the tracks and working hard to return them to normal, but at present we have no estimate as to when we will be able to operate services on the affected routes.""

He added that Northern will ""try to run as many services as possible"".

Other train companies hit by the weather include CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, LNER, TransPennine Express, Transport for Wales and Virgin Trains.

The downpours also caused mayhem on roads as several routes were blocked and some vehicles were abandoned in floodwater.

Sheffield City Council said 14 of its roads were closed due to flooding as of 7am, and urged drivers to take extra care.

Six of the roads were reopened by 8.20am

The rail operators' ‘do not travel’ advice for passengers still stands.

River Derwent in Derbyshire has also burst its banks causing people to evacuate homes and take refuge in a shopping centre.

Only 18 flood warnings have been deescalated in the last 24 hours.

When one months worth of rain fell in two days it wreaked havoc on areas of the country.

An Environment Agency (EA) rain gauge showed Swineshaw in the Peak District saw 4.4in of rain yesterday - the highest total of anywhere across England.

The average monthly rainfall total for the region at this time of year, is 3.5in.

Homes were evacuated and cars submerged in water were abandoned.

Thirty-five homes were cleared out as a precaution in Mansfield after a mudslide on Thursday night.

Last night, dozens of people became stranded in shopping centres in Sheffield and Nottinghamshire.

Police ordered shoppers, a number of which had travelled to Meadowhall Centre for a Christmas event, to stay put.

Pictures taken from those stuck in the centre emerged showing people and staff in makeshift beds in a communal area and stock room.

In a later statement, Meadowhall said: “Whilst the road networks have been severely affected by the floods, our centre remains dry and secure.

“The majority of customers left the building before the centre officially closed at 22.00 hours but there are a small number of people who have chosen to stay with us for the time being.

“We will continue to look after them until they can return home safely.”

Saskia Hazelwood, 17, from Doncaster, said she was among those stranded in Sheffield’s Meadowhall shopping centre.

She said: “When we got to Meadowhall it was very hectic and we heard about the flooding and saw the river about to burst.

“Our trains were then cancelled so we went to get food, then spoke to the police and security and they told us it was unsafe to leave and there was no way of getting in or out.

“So we instantly started panicking and, when we found out there was no way of getting home, we went into Primark and all bought spare clothes and we bought food and drinks to keep us going throughout the night.

“We were in M&S for a while on the sofas until they closed the store, and we were then moved to the Oasis food quarter. We were there until 7am.”

Saskia, a student, added: “We were provided with free refreshments throughout the night and morning but it was certainly not enough.

“We had to basically camp out in the food area until they finally got a taxi to us at 7am.

“None of us had slept for over 24 hours. We were very tired, stressed and, of course, our families were panicking and kept keeping in touch.

“My dad even tried driving to us around 11.30pm but, because the centre was gridlocked and also flooded and shut off, he wasn’t able to get to us and so he had to turn around and go home.

“At the start we thought it would be fun, a nice sleepover, something to certainly remember, but after 14 hours of being stranded in Meadowhall we just couldn’t wait to get home, get into our own beds, feel safe again, and catch up on sleep.”

Around 25 homes in Worksop were also evacuated due to the risk of flooding.

Damien West, head of prevention and protection at Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service, tweeted: “In Worksop with Crews who are working tirelessly to rescue a large number of people from flooded premises.

923505,thesun,"IF YOU'RE a gardener who speaks to your shrubs, there's hope for you yet: A new study shows plants can hear.

Scientists found that some flowers listen for the buzz of a bee's wings and make their nectar sweeter if they hear it.

This entices the insects to visit more often, giving the plant a better chance of spreading its pollen.

The discovery boosts our understanding of the evolution of flowers and insects, say researchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel.

When they played recordings of bee buzzes to evening primrose flowers, the plants boosted the sugar content of their nectar.

But when played sounds at a higher frequency, like those made by a mosquito, the flowers did not change their nectar.

Researchers suggest that the sound of a bee makes tiny vibrations in flower petals that trigger the sugar response.

The finding is the first evidence that plants can respond to sounds in ""an ecologically relevant way"", scientists wrote in their study published on the website BioRxiv.

It hints that plantlife is also impacted by human-made noises, which may damage the ability of flowers and bees to communicate.

This is not the first time scientists have investigated the hearing ability of plants.

Research has found plants can also listen out for flowing water through vibrations made in soil.

This helps them grow their roots in the right direction.

Another recent plant study suggested that plants know when you're eating them.

Shrubs release special chemicals in response to damage that sends signals ""like a pain response"", scientists found.

While growth remains soft, Goldman’s current activity indicator in February is slightly above the downwardly-revised December and January numbers.

“Some green shoots are emerging that suggest that sequential growth will pick up from here,” Hatzius and Sven Jari Stehn wrote in a note dated Feb. 26. Still, the risk to Goldman’s global GDP forecast of 3.5 percent for 2019 “is probably still on the downside.”

Goldman also sees tentative signs of a turnaround in Chinese growth. That’s in line with Bloomberg’s snapshot of early indicators of activity:

Some executives remain cautious. Jamie Dimon, Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., used the bank’s annual presentation to investors to acknowledge a growing number of potential obstacles to the economy that carried his firm to record profits last year.

“We are prepared for a recession,” Dimon said. “We’re not predicting a recession. We’re simply pointing out that we are very conscious about the risks we bear.”

Goldman reckons Europe looks like the weakest major region, “with Italy in recession, Germany close to it, and most other economies growing at only about a trend pace,” according to the note. Goldman has pushed back its expectations for the first ECB hike from late-2019 to mid-2020.

As for the Fed, Goldman says the prospects for moves in the next 6 to 9 months have fallen and an increase toward the end of the year would require a rebound in both growth and core inflation.

42974,bbcuk,"Parliament is set to be suspended next week in order for the government to hold a Queen's Speech - laying out its policy agenda - in October.

But the controversial move does not just make it harder for MPs to block a no-deal Brexit.

When a Parliament is suspended - or prorogued - all outstanding bills going through the legislative process are effectively killed off.

So what could that mean for laws relating to Northern Ireland?

After Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his decision to suspend Parliament, the Labour MP Jess Phillips took to social media to say she was concerned about what it would mean for a flagship piece of legislation relating to domestic abuse.

It was introduced by Theresa May in the last days of her premiership but has not moved through most stages of the Parliamentary process yet.

The bill would bring in the first ever statutory government definition of domestic abuse to include economic abuse and controlling and manipulative non-physical abuse.

Crucially, it would also be extended to Northern Ireland to allow coercive control to become an offence in the region for the first time.

That's because Northern Ireland has been without its own government for more than two years now, with no ministers in place to pass any laws through the devolved institutions.

Former Stormont justice minister Claire Sugden, who had backed the move to extend the law to Northern Ireland, said it would be an ""insult"" to victims if the bill was lost in ""brinkmanship"".

""We've waited too long and this needs to happen now to prevent further victims,"" she said.

""The prime minister talks big about improving people's lives through his fresh domestic agenda and if he means it then he must prioritise this bill.

""A new broom won't sweep away the issues that continue to destroy lives.""

She added that if the bill fell in Westminster, it could be picked up by a future Stormont executive, but that required the two main parties to ""put aside their party politics"".

Asked by BBC News NI if Number 10 would commit to ensuring the bill was part of the next programme for government, the Home Office said the government was ""determined to continue with the work done so far on legislating to support the victims of domestic abuse"".

In recent months, the government has also been under pressure to pass legislation through Westminster to provide compensation to victims of historical institutional abuse (HIA).

The HIA Inquiry was set up by Stormont leaders in 2013 to investigate allegations of abuse in children's residential homes run by religious, charitable and state organisations.

Since the inquiry ended two years ago, 30 survivors of historical institutional abuse have died and payments have been stalled due to the lack of devolution.

Conservative MP Simon Hoare, the chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, said on Thursday the looming suspension effectively ""slams the brakes"" on attempts to bring the laws through Westminster.

Last week, victims and survivors met the Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith and said he told them he was looking for a ""slot"" in early autumn to bring it to Parliament.

Margaret McGuckin from the abuse victims' group Savia, said the government's decision to prorogue Parliament had ""scuppered"" that.

""It is heartbreaking and outrageous, that is no way to run a government - but we are not stopping,"" she said.

""I have written to the secretary of state and Simon Hoare to put through the legislation [in] early September before Parliament is suspended.""

For its part, the government has already committed to bringing through legislation to provide redress to victims, if Stormont is not restored before the end of 2019.

But victims have said they cannot wait any longer and want the law fast-tracked through Parliament.

Since Wednesday's announcement of impending prorogation, questions have also been raised about whether it could affect potential law changes regarding same-sex marriage and abortion laws in Northern Ireland.

In July, the government passed a bill that will legalise same-sex marriage and liberalise abortion laws on the condition that Stormont is not restored by 21 October.

Ultimately, that has already become law and will not be affected by the suspension of Parliament, which will resume on 14 October when the government holds its Queen's Speech.

The government has committed to changing the laws on those two matters - as well as introducing a pension for victims of the Troubles - and there's no suggestion at the moment that that legislation would be delayed.

The other question about 21 October is what happens regarding the government's obligation to call a Stormont assembly election if devolution isn't restored by 21 October.

The law gives the Northern Ireland secretary the power to order an extension and push back that requirement to 13 January 2020.

685294,theguardianuk,"Lots of academics worry that focusing too much on the real-world impact of
research threatens pure, curiosity-driven science. But really the two go hand
in hand, especially when it comes to solving the complex question of how we
achieve sustainability despite increasing human pressures on our planet.

As a tropical field ecologist studying rainforest destruction in Borneo, I saw
the impact of the expanding palm oil industry on tropical biodiversity first
hand, and so it was always a high priority to ensure the research I was doing
made a difference. I was driven by scientific curiosity about how nature
responds to the most drastic human activity, but also by the motivation to
find solutions.

A Natural Environment
[Research](https://www.theguardian.com/education/research) Council-funded
fellowship allowed me a rare opportunity to devote all my energies to using
science to teach palm oil companies how to look after biodiversity. In just
under four years I was able to translate the pure ecological research I had
done for my PhD, studying the responses of ants and butterflies to the
destruction of tropical forests, into practical knowledge which will actually
save rainforests.

I worked with the industry to develop a practical toolkit for stopping
deforestation in tropical commodity industries, by showing how big rainforest
reserves need to be to conserve biodiversity in land dominated by plantations.
The toolkit, spearheaded by Greenpeace and several key palm oil industry
players, has so far been used to conserve half a million hectares of forest in
multiple countries – not only in the palm oil sector, but also in rubber, pulp
and paper, and cocoa. Last month the major certification standard for palm
oil, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), voted to use the toolkit
to strengthen its “no deforestation” policy. Hopefully this will lead to
larger areas of forest being protected from an industry that has been
responsible for worrying levels of habitat destruction.

Work like this doesn’t just have an immediate impact on the environment; it
has a multiplier effect on the wider research landscape. The government’s
research excellence framework, the exercise that assigns universities funding,
is coming up in 2021, and much discussion has focused on whether it’s fair
that it places a lot of emphasis on research projects being able to
demonstrate impact through case studies. My experience has confirmed their
importance: work on the toolkit has secured nearly £2m in new research
funding. An understanding of the knowledge needs of the industry has resulted
in repeat funding from the RSPO for our [socially and

programme](http://www.sensorproject.net) aimed at testing the impact of
certification.

The work has also helped me forge new academic collaborations. My links with
Indonesian academics resulted in a project with the
[Universities](https://www.theguardian.com/education/universities) of York and
Leeds and the Zoological Society of London to investigate the impacts of
peatland restoration in Sumatra. This wouldn’t have come about without those
critical local partner contacts.

These varied perspectives have also been a source of new routes of scientific
enquiry. For me, questions about how to develop conservation policy changed
the debate from “How do species respond to habitat fragmentation?” to “How big
is big enough to support biodiversity?”.

So why aren’t we seeing more of this in UK academia? Positions in universities
focused on building links between pure research and the industries,
organisations and individuals that will use it tend to be short-term or
administrative. To really make a difference, we need long-term networks led by
academic staff who are experts in working with industry.

There is no reason why science with a social or environmental impact should
compete with the need for pure research. As with my own example, applied

Global say they will be creating the three largest commercial radio breakfast shows in the UK, with 4.8m, 3.7m and 2.7m listeners respectively each week.

But it means a reduction in locally produced programmes, with more than 100 jobs at risk due to the changes.

Ofcom has approved the move following a change in guidelines for local radio.

Capital will launch their network breakfast show first in April, with Heart and Smooth following later in the year.

Global says local news and travel information ""will continue to air on a local licence level as per legislation requirements"".

But it said its news teams would see ""refreshed structures"" along with engineering and marketing.

Analysis by Radio Today said that 95 local radio presenters could lose their jobs as a result of the changes.

The changes will also mean the closure of broadcast facilities. The sites earmarked for closure are Brighton, Cambridge, Chelmsford, Exeter, Gloucester, Kendal, Kent, Lancaster, Norwich and Swindon.

Global's revamp is likely to be replicated at its biggest commercial rival, Bauer, which owns stations like Kiss, Absolute and Magic.

The companies have been given the go-ahead by broadcasting regulator Ofcom, which relaxed its rules on how and where stations make their programmes last October.

Stations still need to apply to change their formats, and Ofcom has published a number of approved format changes for Global Radio stations across the UK.

Ashley Tabor, Global's founder, told staff the news at a meeting on Tuesday and said it ""would mean change"".

Yet he also said ""the ability to lead the commercial radio sector's next huge step, and to properly compete with BBC Radio 1 and 2 at breakfast time"" was ""a huge opportunity"".

Meanwhile, Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson - who is also the shadow culture secretary - said the announcement was a ""terrible blow"".

He added: ""The loss of more than 100 local radio jobs across the country is a travesty and particularly damaging at a time when local news is already under extreme pressure.

""Replacing local voices with London-based presenters will be a terrible loss to communities across the country.""

Many big-name stars have yet to comment on the news, but some station staff have given their reaction.

BBC Berkshire presenter Paul Coia tweeted his support for his fellow radio professionals.

34087,bbc,"The Pope has declared that the rule of ""pontifical secrecy"" no longer applies to the sexual abuse of minors, in a bid to improve transparency in such cases.

The Church previously shrouded sexual abuse cases in secrecy, in what it said was an effort to protect the privacy of victims and reputations of the accused.

But new papal documents on Tuesday lifted restrictions on those who report abuse or say they have been victims.

Church leaders called for the rule's abolition at a February Vatican summit.

They said the lifting of the rule in such cases would improve transparency and the ability of the police and other civil legal authorities to request information from the Church.

Information in abuse cases should still be treated with ""security, integrity and confidentiality"", the Pope said in his announcement. He instructed Vatican officials to comply with civil laws and assist civil judicial authorities in investigating such cases.

The Pope also changed the Vatican's definition of child pornography, increasing the age of the subject from 14 or under to 18 or under.

Charles Scicluna, the Archbishop of Malta and the Vatican's most experienced sex abuse investigator, called the move an ""epochal decision that removes obstacles and impediments"", telling Vatican news that ""the question of transparency now is being implemented at the highest level"".
• Child sexual abuse and the Catholic Church: What you need to know

The Church has been rocked by thousands of reports of sexual abuse by priests and accusations of cover-ups by senior clergy around the world. Pope Francis has faced serious pressure to provide leadership and generate workable solutions to the crisis, which has engulfed the Church in recent years.

Pontifical secrecy was designed to protect sensitive information such as communications between the Vatican and papal embassies - in a similar fashion to the secrecy applied to diplomatic cables. But it was also applied over the years to judicial cases, to protect the privacy of victims and the identities of those accused.

Critics said pontifical secrecy had been abused by some Church officials to avoid co-operation with the police in abuse cases.

""Certain jurisdictions would have easily quoted the pontifical secret ... to say that they could not, and that they were not, authorised to share information with either state authorities or the victims,"" Archbishop Scicluna said. ""Now that impediment, we might call it that way, has been lifted, and the pontifical secret is no more an excuse.""

Under the new instruction, the pontifical secret no longer binds those working in offices of the Roman Curia to confidentiality on other offences if committed in conjunction with child abuse or child pornography. Witnesses, alleged victims, and the person who filed the report are also be unbound from obligations of silence.

On his 83rd birthday, Pope Francis has responded to a longstanding complaint from survivors by announcing that any testimony gathered by the Church in relation to cases of sexual violence, the abuse of minors and child pornography will now be made available to state authorities.

In the past, the Church has been accused of using secrecy laws as a justification for not reporting cases of abuse. The consequence of breaching the pontifical secret was excommunication from the Church, so there was little incentive to be open to state authorities. That prohibition has now been abolished.

It is the latest attempt by the Roman Catholic Church to address the scourge of clerical abuse that has manifested itself across continents and in a range of religious institutions.",Pope lifts 'pontifical secret' rule in sex abuse cases,religion and belief,religious institutions and state relations,567

The city council is expected to vote Monday on a deal to lease the Des Plaines Theatre to Onesti Entertainment Corporation, which will book shows and operate a restaurant at the 1925 Art Deco-style building at 1476 Miner St.

Ron Onesti, the president of the company, said he realizes the project is important to Des Plaines residents and business owners.

""Let me just make it clear that this is all subject to the city council approval, and if it does go through, I would consider it an honor and responsibility that I wouldn't take lightly,"" Onesti said.

City officials began searching for a company to run the day-to-day operations of the theater in July 2018 and interviewed three firms. The city council interviewed two of those companies and then authorized City Manager Mike Bartholomew to negotiate the lease agreement with Onesti.

Bartholomew cited Onesti's track record of success operating the Arcada Theatre in St. Charles as a reason for choosing his company as the finalist. Onesti also operates Rock 'N Ravioli Restaurant and Music Hall and the Bourbon 'N Brass Speakeasy & Jazz Club in Evanston.

""We were aligned on the vision of the theater,"" Bartholomew said. ""We want the theater to be an experience. We want people to go to the theater, no matter what the show is.""

Under the proposed five-year agreement, the city will lease the theater to Onesti for free during its first six months of operations and $10,000 per month the next six months. Rent will increase to $12,000 per month the second year, $14,000 per month the third year, $16,000 per month the fourth year and $18,000 per month the fifth year. The city has the option to renew the lease.

However, the city is less concerned about earning money and more focused on the number of people the theater can draw downtown. City leaders view the theater as the anchor of an entertainment and restaurant district and even has a grant program to give new restaurants up to $100,000 to locate there.

""The payoff isn't how much money we can make on rent,"" Bartholomew said. ""The payoff is people.""

The proposed deal is unique because Onesti will help the city decide the layout and design of the restaurant on second level, a bar concept on the first level and seating for anywhere between 600 to 900 people. The agreement stipulates the city will prepare the restaurant space to ""vanilla box form"" -- meaning it will install electrical, drywall and a layer of paint. The cost of installing a kitchen, tables and chairs and all other aspects of the restaurant will be paid by Onesti.

The city estimates construction could take between six and nine months.

Though Onesti is staying quiet about the type of restaurant that may open, he pointed to the shows and the overall experience at the Arcada Theatre as a blueprint for what he envisions for Des Plaines.

Typically, the Arcada books a wide variety of musical acts. For example, recent and upcoming acts include Jay and the Americans, B.B. King's Blues Band featuring Michael Lee from ""The Voice,"" Warrant, Steven Adler of Guns N' Roses and Dwight Yoakam.

""Everything is ambience-driven, themed and upscale,"" Onesti said. ""The experience is as important as the quality of food and the level of the cocktails.""

The city entered an agreement with Rivers Casino in May 2018 to buy the shuttered theater, with the casino pledging up to $2 million to help purchase and renovate the building. The city completed the purchase of the building in June and has been completing improvements to the venue.

Richard Kelly, 53, is being treated for liver cancer and was due to start a cutting-edge treatment, selective internal radiation therapy (Sirt), alongside chemotherapy in April — but despite Sirt being recommended months ago, at his last appointment on 23rd April his oncologist at Bristol Royal Infirmary informed him ""NHS England were unable to set a budget for this kind of treatment because of the chaotic nature of the Brexit negotiations and the actual leaving of the European Union…therefore this essential treatment was delayed, with no suggestion of a date when it would be available,"" Kelly told The Independent.

​The delay in Britain's scheduled departure date for leaving the EU was expected to limit the damaging consequences of a no deal Brexit — but Kelly was told ""in black and white terms"" that Brexit was putting his life at risk.

Consultants had offered the ""groundbreaking"" form of radiotherapy after they determined his cancer had progressed and was ""incurable"", but could be contained with chemotherapy. But while Kelly's doctors didn't discuss whether other patients had been affected by Brexit, he said he knew of other people who certainly had been.

""I can't be the only one, how serious is this going to get? We haven't even left. That big red bus said £350 million a week going into the NHS, but we can't even afford cancer treatment. This is the reality of it, thanks a bunch Nigel Farage,"" Kelly despaired.

While the UK will continue to use EU standards on medicines and clinical trials in the short term once it leaves the EU, the charity noted there would still be some degree of disruption — and urged drugs companies to stockpile medicines just in case.

In February, the Royal College of Radiologists cautioned NHS trusts would have ""no choice but to prioritise"" which patients receive cancer treatment should a no-deal Brexit go ahead and delay the import of radioactive isotopes.

The College said it had not seen the ""detail of the customs paperwork"" that would allow the materials, which cannot be stockpiled as they decay too quickly, to gain fast-track entry into the UK — medical isotopes are used in nuclear medicine either to treat cancer by killing diseased cells, or to diagnose diseases by injecting a radioactive tracer into the body that allows scanner images to be taken of tissue and organs.

LATAKIA /Syria/, June 17. /TASS/. The temporary accommodation centers in the Syrian province of Latakia have received refugees from the Idlib de-escalation zone where military activities are ongoing, Spokesman for the Russian Center for Reconciliation of the Opposing Sides in Syria Sergei Smolinsky told reporters, adding that the Russian military had provided humanitarian aid to the refugees.

Officers from the Russian Center continue to distribute food kits and bedding among refugees, while military doctors provide them with medical assistance.

According to Idlib Governor Fadi Sadun, the authorities are determined to make everything possible to encourage people to return to their homes. ""Many families left Idlib. According to our data, as many as 7,500 refugees reside in Latakia, 11,000 found shelter in Hama, while others moved to Homs, Damascus and other cities. Our goal is to bring them back and we will make every effort to that end. The process will begin as soon as the situation in Idlib improves,"" he said.

In accordance with a decision made by Russia, Iran and Turkey - the guarantors of the Syrian ceasefire - de-escalation zones were set up in Syria in May 2017. They include the Idlib Province, some parts of its neighboring areas in the Latakia, Hama and Aleppo provinces, Eastern Ghouta, as well as some areas in the Daraa and al-Quneitra provinces in southern Syria. Damascus took control of three of the four zones in 2014, but the zone covering the Idlib province and certain parts of the Latakia, Hama and Aleppo provinces is still controlled by terrorists from the Jabhat al-Nusra terror group (outlawed in Russia).

Head of the Russian Center for Reconciliation Major General Viktor Kupchishin said earlier that the Suran checkpoint had been established to secure the exit of civilians from the Idlib de-escalation zone.

388467,npr,"A man accused of stabbing and wounding five people at a rabbi's home in an Orthodox Jewish community in Rockland County, New York, just as they were lighting candles for Hanukkah, pleaded not guilty on Sunday to five counts of attempted murder.

Police have identified the alleged attacker as Grafton E. Thomas, 37, of Greenwood Lake, N.Y. He is currently in custody on attempted murder charges and one count of burglary.

It is unclear whether the rabbi's house was targeted, or what may have precipitated the attack. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is now probing Thomas' background to try to determine a possible motivation.

On Saturday, around 10 p.m., members of Etya Gluck's family and others gathered at the rabbi's house to observe the seventh night of Hanukkah.

A knock on the door revealed a man they did not recognize.

""His shawl came up to his nose and his hoodie came down to his forehead,"" Gluck, 31, of Monsey, N.Y., told NPR.

She said the man was holding something large, but people in the house mistook the object for something else.

""They thought it was an umbrella. It was in the holder, like the storybooks,"" said Gluck, noting that before long those gathered at the rabbi's house realized the assailant was wielding a ""giant"" knife.

Gluck said her two children were on their way to the rabbi's house but had not arrived before the attack.

Her husband, Josef Gluck, the building manager at the synagogue, Congregation Netzach Yisroel, which is close to the rabbi's home, was inside the home when the man stormed in carrying the knife.

Gluck said as some were fleeing the violent scene to seek shelter, her husband fought back.

""My husband threw the table at him so he shouldn't injure this old sick man who was already injured,"" Gluck said. ""Then he dragged himself to the synagogue and tried to get in. The door was locked. So he dragged himself to the car.""

But before the assailant drove away, a witness was able to take a photograph of the license plate, allowing police to track the vehicle and eventually make an arrest in New York City's Harlem neighborhood, police said.

""It was critical to the case,"" Ramapo Police Chief Brad Weidel told reporters on Sunday.

Authorities said two of the five victims are still hospitalized.

While officials would not attribute a motive, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the attack is part of ""hatred exploding"" across the country.

""It is an American cancer that is spreading in the body politic,"" Cuomo said.

The rabbi's home where the attack took place is located about 30 miles north of New York City in an area that has a large population of ultra-Orthodox Jews.

President Trump called the stabbings ""horrific,"" saying on Twitter, ""We must all come together to fight, confront, and eradicate the evil scourge of anti-Semitism.""

Standing in front of the rabbi's home on Sunday, Cuomo characterized the violent episode ""an act of domestic terrorism.""

""These are people who intend to create mass harm, mass violence, generate fear, based on race, color, creed. That is the definition of terrorism,"" Cuomo said.

On Sunday, Thomas was arraigned and pleaded not guilty. A judge set his bail at $5 million. Thomas is now being held at the Rockland County Jail.

Aron Kohn, who was in the rabbi's house during the attack, said a Hanukkah candle had just been lit before the intruder stormed in around 10 p.m.

""He started running into the big room, which was on the left side. And I threw tables and chairs, that he should get out of here,"" Kohn told reporters Sunday night. ""I ran into the other room because I wanted to save my life.""

Earlier, Cuomo tweeted that he was ""horrified"" by the stabbings.

""We have zero tolerance for anti-Semitism in NY and we will hold the attacker accountable to the fullest extent of the law. NY stands with the Jewish community,"" said Cuomo, noting that the episode was the 13th anti-Semitic attack in New York since Dec. 8.

The attack comes amid reports of a spate of anti-Semitic violence in New York City and the surrounding area. Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday that police would increase their presence in neighborhoods with large Jewish populations.

In the past week, there have been reports of people being punched, slapped, hit in the face with a bag, and anti-Semitic slurs being shouted.

And earlier this month, a pair of shooters attacked a kosher market in Jersey City, N.J., killing three civilians, after killing a police officer at a nearby cemetery. New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said the evidence pointed toward ""acts of hate"" in the attacks, with the attackers motivated by both ""anti-Semitism and anti-law enforcement beliefs.""

Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said the recent attacks mean law enforcement needs to step up protection of the Jewish community.

""Whether worshiping in synagogue, shopping in the supermarket or celebrating at home, Jews should be safe from violence,"" he wrote. ""We need authorities to provide increased protection NOW and ensure that the full force of the law is brought down on those who perpetrate such horrific crimes.""",Gov.

12602,aljazeera,"Six months after the US sanctions came into effect, Iran's economy appears to be struggling. Efforts by the international community to salvage the nuclear deal and provide an economic lifeline to Iran to dampen the fallout of the sanctions have not borne fruit so far and recent devastating floods in the oil-producing southwest of the country have only exacerbated the situation.

Even before the recent decision by the United States government not to extend waivers provided to eight buyers of Iranian oil, the Islamic Republic was able to sell no more than 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd). Now its oil exports are expected to drop even further, which means the deficit gap in the state budget this year will be larger than expected.

At the same time, the measures the Iranian government is taking in order to minimise the effect of the sanctions are unsustainable and unlikely to work, as they do not address any of the major structural problems the economy suffers from.

The Islamic Republic continues to resort to inefficient stop-gap economic policies because giving up on its promise of social provision, which constitutes a major part of its post-1979 social contract, could endanger its survival.

When preparing the budget bill for this year, President Hassan Rouhani's administration planned for oil exports to be around 1.5 million bpd, sold at a price of $54 a barrel or above. Thus the budget submitted to parliament earlier this year was set at 4.8 quadrillion rial (around $47bn at the current unofficial exchange rate) and up to 33 percent of it was supposed to come from oil revenue.

Earlier this year, before the Trump administration took the decision to stop US sanction waivers was announced, the oil sector was estimated to shrink between 26 and 31 percent. With this announcement, the slump in the oil industry is expected to be even bigger.

Even if the US fails to bring Iranian oil exports to zero, sales will definitely collapse way below the government-projected 1.5 million bpd (and even below the 1.1 million bpd estimated by market experts), leaving Iran with a large financial gap.

This comes amid an already raging economic crisis which the Iranian authorities have struggled to contain. As inflation hit 40 percent earlier this year, consumer prices went up by 40 to 60 percent, putting additional strain on the already impoverished lower-class Iranian households.

Key industries - like the petrochemical, car and construction industries, which are highly dependent on imported equipment, spare parts and raw materials - are also suffering from the depreciation of the Iranian currency, which last year lost more than 100 percent of its value, significantly decreasing the purchasing power of Iranian companies on the international market.

Overall, Iran's economy in 2019 is expected to go even deeper into recession, with estimated negative growth of 5.5 percent or higher.

In the face of a looming economic disaster, the Iranian government is paradoxically adopting policies that do not address any of the major structural problems burdening the national economy.

The budget voted in March envisions an increase in current expenditures by 16 percent to maintain existing social programmes, boost state employee salaries to compensate for the negative effect of inflation and provide cheaper foreign currency to companies importing essential goods and raw materials. Some $14bn has been allocated to maintain the low prices on basic food products and medicines.

The government is also seeking to regulate domestic prices by directly demanding from some producers to accept lower profit margins. It also offers low prices for the produce of local farmers so it can provide foodstuffs at minimal cost to the general public.

It continues to subsidise fuel and electricity and is even considering the reintroduction of the coupon system it used to run during the 1980s Iran-Iraq war to allocate cheap basic goods to Iranian household.

But these policies are neither sustainable nor efficient. Iran's financial capacity has already been overstretched by the substantial social spending the government has undertaken in recent years. Currently, annual subsidies and social programmes cost the Iranian government up to half of the total budget.

The fact that oil exports will slump below what was planned for in the state budget means that the government will simply not have the money to implement some of these policies.

In fact, it is already struggling to fulfil some of the plans it has made to provide additional assistance to struggling sectors. As of mid-March, the Iranian authorities had already failed to provide 20 percent of the loans they promised to car makers and car spare part producers.

It also had to cancel a programme supplying bread producers with cheap wheat flour in order to reallocate the funds to cover the guaranteed purchases of grain from local farmers.

Tehran's attempts to control consumer prices are also not working. Providing importers with cheap foreign currency is unlikely to produce the desired results. The Majlis Research Center, a think-tank affiliated with the Iranian parliament, recently found that in 2018 a similar measure had little effect on consumer prices and inflation, as the recipients of cheap foreign exchange currency tended to either sell it on the black market or sell the goods they imported at inflated prices.

Price controls on local producers could also backfire. They could further discourage local businesses from expanding production given the rising cost of raw materials and shrinking profit margins and encourage the excessive export of goods out of the country, adding to the market deficit. Temporary export bans on selected items such as poultry, sugar, certain types of fruit, and more have only stimulated the smuggling business.

Meanwhile, the government is pulling funds out of long-term development and infrastructural projects. In this year's budget, the allocated funds to the National Development Fund which is supposed to help decrease the dependence of the Iranian economy on oil are inadequate. The fund has also lost part of its reserves which were reallocated to cover military and civilian expenditures.

The main reason behind the Iranian leadership's failure to improve the country's economic situation is its tendency to focus on dealing with the consequences of economic problems (such as high inflation rates, rising prices, illegal economic activities etc) rather than their sources. In order to find sustainable solutions to Iran's economic challenges, Tehran will need to make some structural reforms including cutting down or, at least, optimising the unjustifiably large social programmes and indirect subsidies.

However, the Iranian leadership is reluctant to take such steps because it goes against its self-declared social protection agenda.

In 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini and his followers declared the protection of the downtrodden, or mostazafin, as one of the main tasks of the newly created Islamic Republic. By doing so, they not only secured the support of the lower classes and guaranteed the durability of their regime, but also unwillingly chained their success to problematic and hard-to-sustain policies such as consumer subsidies.

As a result, the Iranian authorities created a mechanism to control the import, production and distribution of basic consumer goods. However, this system, which helped guarantee the survival of the regime for four decades, came at a heavy cost - it swallowed valuable financial resources that could have been used to develop the economy.

Today, the Iranian leadership knows that it cannot resolve the country's economic problems without stripping down this social protection system. However, it also knows that attempting to change this system would lead to an immediate rise in consumer prices, which could turn the lower classes against the regime.

Under these circumstances, Iran's economic prospects for 2019 remain gloomy. In order to cope with the country's deep-rooted economic problems, Tehran has to conduct substantial reforms - something the current leadership is reluctant to do. Consequently, the Iranian government is stuck with the unproductive policy of trying to deal with the consequences of problems rather than their origin for yet another year.

240739,hotair,"For some reason it’s the petty corruption of stories like this and the Lori Loughlin one, involving fatcats rigging the college process for their kids, that brings out my inner populist more so than the grand-scale corruption that the rich routinely engage in. You want to buy off federal regulators to protect your business’s bottom line? Eh, whatever. That’s something elite cretins in every society do.

You want to run a scam to get your kid a discount admission to university when poorer families are desperate for aid? Then we should turn you and your spawn into hot dogs.

Partly that’s me being parochial. Many of us know firsthand the financial burden of paying for school whereas influence peddling on Capitol Hill doesn’t reach us as directly. But it’s also partly the sense that the playing field should be a bit more equal for kids, at least. There’s so much time for the rich to game various systems to their advantage once they’re adults! At least give the teens from schlubby middle-class families a fighting chance.

Anyway, fire up the grill. It’s hot-dog time.

Parents are giving up legal guardianship of their children during their junior or senior year in high school to someone else — a friend, aunt, cousin or grandparent. The guardianship status then allows the students to declare themselves financially independent of their families so they can qualify for federal, state and university aid, a ProPublica Illinois investigation found… ProPublica Illinois found more than 40 guardianship cases fitting this profile filed between January 2018 and June 2019 in the Chicago suburbs of Lake County alone. The parents involved in these cases include lawyers, a doctor and an assistant schools superintendent, as well as insurance and real estate agents. A number of the children are high-achieving scholars, athletes and musicians who attend or have been accepted to a range of universities… In Illinois last year, about 82,000 students who were eligible for the [Monetary Award Program] grant, up to about $5,000, did not receive it because there wasn’t enough money. The grant is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis.

In other words, if you’re in the not-so-sweet spot between middle class, where your kid qualifies for aid, and quite rich, where the cost of education is of no consequence, you’re better off effectively emancipating them so that they can feed from the same trough of grant money as students in more dire need of financial help. The Journal looked at one case:

One Chicago-area woman told The Wall Street Journal that she transferred guardianship of her then 17-year-old daughter to her business partner last year. While her household income is greater than $250,000 a year, she said, she and her husband have spent about $600,000 putting several older children through college and have no equity in their home, which is valued at about $1.2 million, according to the property website Zillow. She said she has little cash on hand and little saved for her daughter’s education… Today, her daughter attends a private college on the West Coast which costs $65,000 in annual tuition, she said. The daughter received a $27,000 merit scholarship and an additional $20,000 in need-based aid, including a federal Pell grant, which she won’t have to pay back. The daughter is responsible for $18,000 a year, which her grandparents pay, the woman said.

Once the guardianship was established, the daughter’s household income for federal financial aid purposes was a scant $4,200. And really, what else could the family in this case do?

What’s that, you say? They could have sent their daughter to a state school instead? Well … yeah, I suppose they could have.

Or they could have asked each of their children to attend state schools so that there’d be money left over to pay the youngest’s tuition? I guess they could have done that too.

Or they could have sold their million-dollar home years ago in anticipation of another round of tuition, downsized to a smaller place, and applied the monthly savings in housing costs to a 529 account?

The Department of Ed is reportedly looking at tightening the rule for guardianships so that students who continue to receive financial support from their parents after a guardianship has been granted would be treated as still belonging to their parents’ household for financial aid purposes. That’s good, but I wonder how easy it would be to skirt it. In one case described by Pro Publica, the guardianship lasted for just a month; presumably it’d be easy for some of these families to gift their kid with, say, six months’ of living expenses before a short-term guardianship so that no support needs to be provided afterwards.

During the operation, ERO officers arrested 46 individuals, mostly criminals, from 10 different countries, according to information obtained from ICE officials.

Officers arrested mostly criminals with either charges or convictions for serious crimes after illegally entering the United States. Some also had charges for immigration violations and final orders of removal.

Samples of the offenses committed or alleged to have been committed include gross sexual imposition, attempted felonious sexual penetration, importuning, attempted unlawful sexual conduct with a minor, criminal sexual conduct – second degree, driving under the influence of liquor, operating while intoxicated, operating a vehicle while impaired, child endangerment, burglary, controlled substance – delivery / manufacture of marijuana, controlled substance – delivery / manufacture of marijuana (conspiracy), marijuana possession, possession of drugs, negligent assault, illegal entry, aggravated burglary, receiving burglary tools, attempted receiving and concealing stolen property, criminal mischief, retail fraud, disorderly conduct, solicit prostitution, obstruct official business, reckless operation of a vehicle, operating a vehicle without a license, and driving while license suspended.

As examples, ICE officials disclosed the following:

Officials reported the arrested individuals, all men, came to the U.S. from Mexico, Senegal, El Salvador, Guatemala, Cameroon, Iraq, United Kingdom, South Korea, Tanzania, and Honduras.

“ICE focuses its enforcement resources on individuals who pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security. However, ICE does not exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement,” officials stated. “All of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and if found removable by final order, removal from the United States. ICE does not conduct sweeps.”

“Upholding public safety by focusing on removing criminal aliens is at the heart of what ERO officers do every day,” Detroit ERO Field Office Director Rebecca Adducci said in a written statement. “These targeted enforcement actions highlight ICE’s vital role in keeping our communities safe.” The Detroit Area of Responsibility includes Michigan and Ohio.

At the same time as this operation, ERO officers in Texas and Oklahoma arrested an additional 94, Breitbart Texas reported. ERO officers carried out other operations in multiple jurisdictions during this same time period.

333339,nationalreview,"Sportsmen have incentives to do the hard work of protecting endangered species and their habitats.

Environmentalists, mainly of the weekend-hiker variety, assume that the only way to save declining species is to “protect” them: ban hunting, put them on endangered-species lists, and otherwise restrict contact between the animal world and the human. Sportsmen have long believed that the best way to save declining species is to kill them: Allowing wild animals to be harvested for food and sport imparts clear value to the species and incentivizes sportsmen to do the hard work of protecting them and their habitat.

The connection between hunting and conservation in the United States goes back at least to the early 20th century. The American Fisheries Society, for example, notes that sportsmen’s organizations such as the Izaak Walton League were instrumental in saving a declining black-bass population after a 1925 report warned that the species would vanish if no action were taken. Anglers partnered with legislators to impose federal restrictions on transporting bass across state lines (they used to be fished for food, believe it or not), and state wildlife agencies worked to conserve and stock the popular game species at the behest of sportsmen. Today, bass fisheries churn out millions of smallmouth, largemouth, and other types of bass each year.

This conservation model has a time-tested track record, but a new study published in Science offers significant evidence that game species stand a much better chance of survival than their non-game counterparts. The top-line results of the study don’t look promising: According to researchers at Cornell University, since the 1970s the North American bird population has declined by 3 billion birds, or 30 percent. Media reports (rightly) have focused on the “staggering” losses, as the study’s first author, Ken Rosenberg, described them in Science.

There is a silver lining, however. Even as species such as sparrows, blackbirds, larks, and finches have sharply declined, the populations of game species including turkeys, grouse, ducks, and geese have grown over the same time period. Conservation organizations such as Ducks Unlimited know that waterfowl populations are healthy. That’s not news. But the fact that these populations have remained stable while other species have taken catastrophic losses testifies to the work of hunters and hunting-related conservation organizations in the United States.

Rosenberg agrees. “Waterfowl are without question the biggest success story, and we highlight that in the paper, and I do in all my talks,” he tells me. “It was the hunters who noticed the declines in waterfowl population in the mid 20th century and did something about it. Policies were put in place and billions of dollars raised by Ducks Unlimited. There was a very targeted effort to manage and protect wetlands, restore wetlands, and restore waterfowl populations to have healthy populations for hunting.”

Mike Brasher, a waterfowl specialist for Ducks Unlimited, explained that the success of game species can be attributed, in part, to their vocal, persistent constituency. “Certainly, the fact that those species are hunted gives them a very involved constituency that has a strong connection to that resource,” he tells me. “When the waterfowl migration is less than the hunters would like to see, they ring the phone off the hook of their biologists and their legislators.”

The numbers testify to the effectiveness of such (nearly literal) grassroots lobbying. According to Rosenberg’s study, while sparrows, blackbirds, and finches have declined by between 30 and 50 percent, the turkey and grouse population is up over 20 percent and the ducks and geese have risen by over 50 percent.

‘Never That Simple’

 As with anything in the natural world, the full truth is complicated. All the biologists and other scientists I spoke with riffed on this theme, and it’s important to note that myriad actors contribute to a species’ success.

“It’s never one factor that’s driving a decline or a rebound,” Brasher says. He points out, for example, that geese adapt readily to urban and agricultural environments, as anyone can testify who’s been chased off his neighborhood pond by a patrol of Canada geese. Much of the increase in the goose population has been driven by a few specific subspecies that thrive in corn and rice fields, according to Brasher.

Mark Hatfield, director of conservation services for the National Wild Turkey Federation, also noted that game species tend to be adaptive by definition — humans hunt the kinds of animals that exist reliably in large numbers. “Game species are typically fairly adaptive. They have a wide geographic range, and they thrive with disturbance and management of habitat,” Hatfield tells me. “One could argue that the reason they are game species is that they are very adaptable. So, we find those species, make them into game, and then figure out how to manage them.”

Still, it’s clear that the efforts of hunters have contributed directly to the health of many game species, and waterfowl are the foremost among them. “The populations of the most abundant species of waterfowl have remained very healthy despite the wetland drainage that continues to occur along with the conversion of native grasses,” Brasher says. “That’s where we start to see the value of all the conservation action through the sustained effort of conservation organizations and conservation supporters — and at the core of those supporters are hunters across the U.S. and Canada.”

Scientists often point to the northern bobwhite as an exception to hunters’ conservation success, but, in this case, it’s an exception that proves the rule. Commonly hunted in the eastern United States, the northern-bobwhite population experienced a massive, 85 percent decline between 1966 and 2014, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The efforts of hunters haven’t been enough to slow the decline, and in many places there are no longer enough northern bobwhites to hunt.

Despite this failure, the northern-bobwhite decline counters the idea that game species are inherently adaptable. Without sufficient intervention from constituencies that love and respect the species, game animals can fall prey to the habitat loss that has decimated most of the bird species that Rosenberg and his colleagues studied.

A Recipe for Success

 Rosenberg names several factors, including pesticides, that may have contributed to the overall decline in the North American bird population. Habitat loss is likely the biggest culprit. He notes that while bird loss is occurring on many different landscapes, those associated with agriculture appear to have been the hardest hit.

“It wasn’t too long ago that there were lots of grassy margins and hedgerows and messiness out there,” he says. “Agricultural areas were full of birds. In the last two decades that’s really changed with the horizon-to-horizon corn and other crops. This clean, intense agriculture has no room for wildlife.”

And hunters shouldn’t assume their favorite species are exempt. Hatfield identifies lack of habitat management in an increasingly urban society as the greatest threat to the wild-turkey populations in the U.S. “As we have become more urban, we have lost the connection to rural lands and a land ethic,” he says. “That lack of management will influence wild-turkey populations across the country.” Prescribed burning, for example, is an effective way to manage timber on large properties, but landowners are often reluctant to utilize it for fear of angering their suburban neighbors, more of whom are now much closer than in generations past.

Historically, this is where Ducks Unlimited, the National Wild Turkey Federation, and a host of similar organizations have proven their worth. Working with state and federal wildlife agencies, these conservation groups use the millions of dollars they raise each year to preserve, manage, and reclaim habitat for wildlife populations from coast to coast.

When I asked for specific examples from Ducks Unlimited, organization reps sent dozens of email attachments highlighting individual projects. Last year, for example, the group partnered with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to transform a 60-acre ditched and drained agricultural field into a “high-functioning habitat for birds.” The field is in Maryland’s Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, which provides 28,000 acres of critical habitat for migrating birds. Ducks Unlimited stepped in because, like many coastal wetlands, the refuge is at risk of being lost to rising sea levels.

Same story at the National Wild Turkey Federation. Through partnerships with hunters, as well as with state and national agencies, the NWTF has organized individual conservation projects to increase the turkey population from 1.3 million in the 1970s to 4.5 million in 2014. The NWTF has conserved 20 million acres of land for turkey habitat since tracking began in 1984. (Ducks Unlimited has conserved 14 million acres since 1937.)

None of the scientists I spoke with suggested that the solution to the dwindling non-game bird population is to declare open season on sparrows and blackbirds. Still, Rosenberg expressed interest in replicating the strategies of hunting-related organizations to help preserve non-game species.

That starts with the grassroots: individuals on the ground working to spend time and money to preserve and maintain habitat. Rosenberg’s team at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology published an article detailing seven simple actions people can take to help preserve the bird population, including making windows safer, keeping cats indoors, and buying coffee from bird-friendly farms.

“It seems trivial, but it’s not. If we can increase the market for these products, we can make a difference,” Rosenberg says.

On a policy level, Rosenberg hopes bird enthusiasts can follow the lead of hunters and encourage lawmakers to impose robust protections on the wildlife they love. “Just the same way the hunters fought for policies like the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, we need equivalent policies that can provide the resources for agencies to manage land,” he says.

While game species will suffer from the same habitat threats that are impacting the larger bird population, the winning recipe for hunters is simple: keep doing what you’re doing. Both Brasher and Hatfield agree that in the conservation eco-system, hunters are the primary producers. Between duck stamps, excise taxes on hunting equipment, private donations, and grassroots advocacy, hunters have fueled our nation’s most successful conservation efforts for nearly 100 years.

“Hunters are the base of the food chain, the most important part of what we do,” Brasher concludes. “They’re the fuel that runs the engine.”",Killing Animals to Save Them? Hunting as Conservation,environment,nature,1679
227660,globalresearch,"With April’s elections looming, Benjamin Netanyahu has good reason to fear Benny Gantz, his former army chief. Gantz has launched a new party, named Israeli Resilience, just as the net of corruption indictments is closing around the prime minister.

Already, at this early stage of campaigning, some 31 per cent of the Israeli public prefer Gantz to head the next government over Netanyahu, who is only months away from becoming the longest-serving leader in Israel’s history. 

 Gantz is being feted as the new hope, a chance to change direction after a series of governments under Netanyahu’s leadership have over the past decade shifted Israel ever further to the right.

Like Israel’s former politician generals, from Yitzhak Rabin to Ehud Barak and Ariel Sharon, Gantz is being portrayed – and portraying himself – as a battle-hardened warrior, able to make peace from a position of strength.

Before he had issued a single policy statement, polls showed him winning 15 of the 120 parliamentary seats, a welcome sign for those hoping that a centre-left coalition can triumph this time.

But the reality of what Gantz stands for – revealed this week in his first election videos – is far from reassuring.

In 2014, he led Israel into its longest and most savage military operation in living memory: 50 days in which the tiny coastal enclave of Gaza was bombarded relentlessly.

By the end, one of the most densely populated areas on earth – its two million inhabitants already trapped by a lengthy Israeli blockade – lay in ruins. More than 2,200 Palestinians were killed in the onslaught, a quarter of them children, while tens of thousands were left homeless.

The world watched, appalled. Investigations by human rights groups such as Amnesty International concluded that Israel had committed war crimes.

One might have assumed that during the election campaign Gantz would wish to draw a veil over this troubling period in his military career. Not a bit of it.

One of his campaign videos soars over the rubble of Gaza, proudly declaring that Gantz was responsible for destroying many thousands of buildings. “Parts of Gaza have been returned to the Stone Age,” the video boasts.

This is a reference to the Dahiya doctrine, a strategy devised by the Israeli military command of which Gantz was a core member. The aim is to lay waste to the modern infrastructure of Israel’s neighbours, forcing survivors to eke out a bare existence rather than resist Israel.

The collective punishment inherent in the apocalyptic Dahiya doctrine is an undoubted war crime.

More particularly, the video exults in the destruction of Rafah, a city in Gaza that suffered the most intense bout of bombing after an Israeli soldier was seized by Hamas. In minutes, Israel’s indiscriminate bombardment killed at least 135 Palestinian civilians and wrecked a hospital.

According to investigations, Israel had invoked the Hannibal Procedure, the code name for an order allowing the army to use any means to stop one of its soldiers being taken. That includes killing civilians as “collateral damage” and, more controversially for Israelis, the soldier himself.

Gantz’s video flashes up a grand total of “1,364 terrorists killed”, in return for “three-and-a-half years of quiet”. As Israel’s liberal Haaretz daily observed, the video “celebrates a body count as if this were just some computer game”.

But the casualty figure cited by Gantz exceeds even the Israel army’s self-serving assessment – as well, of course, as dehumanising those “terrorists” fighting for their freedom.

A more impartial observer, Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, estimates that the Palestinian fighters killed by Israel amounted to 765. By their reckoning, and that of other bodies such as the United Nations, almost two-thirds of Gazans killed in Israel’s 2014 operation were civilians.

Further, the “quiet” Gantz credits himself with was enjoyed chiefly by Israel.

In Gaza, Palestinians faced regular military attacks, a continuing siege choking off essential supplies and destroying their export industries, and a policy of executions by Israeli snipers firing on unarmed demonstrators at the perimeter fence imprisoning the enclave.

Gantz’s campaign slogans “Only the Strong Wins” and “Israel Before Everything” are telling. Everything, for Gantz, clearly includes human rights.

It is shameful enough that he believes his track record of war crimes will win over voters. But the same approach has been voiced by Israel’s new military chief of staff.

Aviv Kochavi, nicknamed the Philosopher Officer for his university studies, was inaugurated this month as the army’s latest head. In a major speech, he promised to reinvent the fabled “most moral army in the world” into a “deadly, efficient” one.

In Kochavi’s view, the rampaging military once overseen by Gantz needs to step up its game. And he is a proven expert in destruction.

In the early stages of the Palestinian uprising that erupted in 2000, the Israeli army struggled to find a way to crush Palestinian fighters concealed in densely crowded cities under occupation.

Kochavi came up with an ingenious solution in Nablus, where he was brigade commander. The army would invade a Palestinian home, then smash through its walls, moving from house to house, burrowing through the city unseen. Palestinian space was not only usurped, but destroyed inside-out.

Gantz, the former general hoping to lead the government, and Kochavi, the general leading its army, are symptoms of just how complete the militaristic logic that has overtaken Israel really is. An Israel determined to become a modern-day Sparta.

Should he bring about Netanyahu’s downfall, Gantz, like his predecessor politician-generals, will turn out to be a hollow peace-maker. He was trained to understand only strength, zero-sum strategies, conquest and destruction, not compassion or compromise.

More dangerously, Gantz’s glorification of his military past is likely to reinforce in Israelis’ minds the need not for peace but for more of the same: support for an ultranationalist right that bathes itself in an ethnic supremacist philosophy and dismisses any recognition of the Palestinians as human beings with rights.

Several thousand people gathered on the state Capitol's west slope on a crisp morning to watch the ceremony under sunny skies.

Current lawmakers and former governors attended the inauguration under tight security that included closed streets.

Polis is a wealthy tech and education entrepreneur and former five-term congressman from Boulder. He succeeds Gov. John Hickenlooper, a centrist Democrat, former Denver mayor, petroleum geologist and beer pub entrepreneur who served the maximum two terms. Hickenlooper is considering a 2020 presidential run.

Polis trounced then-state treasurer Walker Stapleton in November. Health care and Donald Trump's presidency were the top issues in the campaign.

The planned festivities include an evening ""Blue Sneaker Ball,"" named after the footwear Polis sported during his campaign. Pop singer and LGBTQ activist Cyndi Lauper and the R&B combo Nathaniel Rateliff & The Nightsweats were scheduled to perform.

Former state Rep. Diane Primavera, a health care advocate, was being sworn in as lieutenant governor. Primavera is a cancer survivor and most recently led Colorado's Susan G. Komen Foundation chapter in its battle against breast cancer.

Polis has promised action on oil and gas drilling and on marijuana policy.

Hickenlooper brokered a tentative compromise on fracking between Colorado's expanding $32 billion oil and gas industry and environmentalists opposed to drilling.

He also oversaw the creation of Colorado's first-in-the-nation recreational marijuana market, which opened in 2014.

Polis once supported fracking limits but has abandoned the stance, saying there's a place for Colorado oil and gas exports even as he pursues a 100 percent renewable energy goal by 2040. Democratic lawmakers are working this session to strengthen air and water quality rules for the fossil fuels industry.

Polis, who was a member of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus, says he'd pursue more industry financing opportunities and add autism to the qualifying conditions for medical marijuana.

Polis has called for universal health care, suggesting Colorado could partner with neighboring states to create a regional market. Lawmakers are studying a state-run insurance market for Colorado.

Polis and Democrats also will pursue funding for full-day kindergarten — and, if Polis gets his way, universal preschool, modeled after an Oklahoma program.

A New York Supreme Court judge upheld the state’s recently passed law that eliminates religious exemptions for student vaccination, just days before school starts.

Acting Supreme Court Justice Denise Hartman ruled against the dozens of parents who filed a lawsuit against the state, denying their request for a preliminary injunction that would have let parents continue to claim the religious exemption until the case was settled.

The lawsuit (pdf) was brought by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and attorney Michael Sussman on behalf of the parents and will still be heard as the school year starts. It argues the law discriminates against religious people and violates the First Amendment rights of parents who don’t want to vaccinate their children.

Parents wrote that “[r]ather than being motivated by any serious concern for public health and despite the rhetoric of the Governor, in the public debate and discourse which proceeded passage of this repeal legislation, numerous leading proponents of the legislation expressed active hostility toward the religious exemption and ridiculed and scorned those who held such exemptions.”

That included Democratic Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins saying “we’ve chosen science over rhetoric” and state Senator James Skoufis, a Democratic sponsor, who said: “There is not one religious institution, not one single one that denounces vaccines. So, here is a religious exemption pretending as if there is a religion out there that has a problem with the vaccines. Whether you are Christian, Jewish or Scientologist, none of these religions have texts or dogma that denounce vaccines. Let’s stop pretending like they do.”

Plaintiffs also said that neither the state House or Senate held public hearings before enacting the legislation.

But Hartman said that a number of court rulings over the past 100 years give the state power to mandate vaccinations for students, including Jacobson v Commonwealth of Massachusetts and Matter of Viemeister.

The Supreme Court ruled in Prince v Massachusetts that a parent “cannot claim freedom from compulsory vaccination for the child more than for himself on religious grounds,” Hartman wrote in the 32-page ruling.

“Because plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, the Supreme Court denies the request for a preliminary injunction; the legislative repeal of the religious exemption remains in effect,” she concluded.

Sussman told The Journal News that he plans to appeal the ruling.

Some 26,000 parents claimed the religious exemption in New York in the 2018-19 school year.

Hartman’s ruling came about six weeks after Supreme Court Justice J. Mackey denied the plaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining order in the case. Another lawsuit brought by parents was dropped last week.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, signed the law on Aug. 13. “The science is crystal clear: Vaccines are safe and effective. While I respect freedom of religion, our first job is to protect public health​,” he said after signing the bill.

Lawmakers said that the United States “is currently experiencing the worst outbreak of measles since 1994, a disease that, in a major health victory, officials declared eliminated from the United States in 2000.”

Some 880 cases were said to have cropped up before the bill was passed across the nation and there were at least 810 confirmed cases of measles in New York state between Oct. 2018 and the bill’s passage.

The memorandum introduced in support of the bill said that “freedom of religion is a founding tenet of this nation” but added: “longstanding precedent establishing that one’s right to free religious expression does not include the right to endanger the health of the community, one’s children, or the children of others.”

New York, with the repeal of the religious exemption, joined California, Maine, West Virginia, and Mississippi as states providing for no religious or other non-medical exemptions from compulsory vaccination laws.

A “danger to life” Yellow weather warning is still in place for the UK, with heavy rain and strong wings predicted until 3pm Wednesday afternoon.

Forecaster Helen Roberts, from the Met Office, confirmed the western isles of Scotland were struck by 71mph winds while “many places” saw winds of up to 60mph.

Several parts of the UK were hit with heavy rain, as the Environmental Agency warned residents and business owners to “be prepared” for flooding, issuing 37 alerts.

Forecasters said 2in-2.4in (50mm-60mm) of rain was possible over higher ground in Cumbria.

Highways England said officers were dealing with severe flooding on the northbound entry slip road to Charnock Richard services off the M6 in Lancashire, while a lane was closed on the M6 southbound near junction 33, at Hampson Green in Lancashire, because of a flood.

The Environment Agency said staff had been working through the night in Cumbria and Lancashire to monitor rain and river levels.

It has issued five flood warnings across Yorkshire and Cumbria and 40 flood alerts.

It said on Twitter: ""We've been out throughout the night clearing grids & removing debris in Cumbria & Lancs to reduce flood risk during Storm Gareth.

""Rain is falling on already wet catchments, therefore it's important that people do remain vigilant, be prepared & know your risk.""

After the rain clears, the storm is expected to bring strong winds, with a chance of damage to buildings, power cuts and travel problems.

The Met Office predicted the winds will hit Northern Ireland at about 3pm on Wednesday, with a yellow warning for all of England and Wales and some parts of Scotland until Wednesday afternoon.

Strong winds were recorded across the UK, with coastal areas expected to be hit with gusts of more than 60mph.

Met Office chief meteorologist Paul Gundersen said: ""The strong north-westerly winds will also affect south-west Scotland late on Tuesday, spreading across much of England and Wales through Wednesday.

""Gusts of 50-55mph are likely inland and up to 65mph along western coasts. Winds will gradually ease during the afternoon.""

Gusts could even reach 80mph along coasts in Northern Ireland, the Met Office said.

In London and the South East, Ms Roberts said things could dry conditions were likely, but it will be “very breezy”.

Ms Roberts also confirmed parts of Scotland and the South East had seen some “wet snow”, but it did not lie in the South East because of the strong winds.

A yellow weather warning for rain is also in place in parts of northern England on Thursday and Friday.

71218,breitbart,"In an exclusive interview with SiriusXM Patriot’s Breitbart News Daily, Malkin said Trump’s threats to close the U.S.-Mexico border to stop illegal immigration must be backed up with action, not just rhetoric.

I don’t want to hear empty threats anymore about how he’s going to do what he should have done many, many, many months ago. The fact that you have a massive number now of … strangers bringing in children, tells you that the very magnet that he says he understands is causing this. The failure to just go ahead executively and fix the asylum system, proves him right on that and yet he’s not doing what he can do as president with his executive authority. [Emphasis added]

Malkin said Trump should have the military at the southern border, asking rhetorically “Does he believe his own rhetoric or not?”

More blame for the levels of illegal immigration the country is currently experiencing should be placed with elected Republicans, Malkin said, who failed to take any action on immigration while controlling the House and Senate for the first two years of Trump’s term.

“Faux pro-borders Republicans … deserve a heck of a lot more scrutiny and condemnation for putting us in the situation that we’re in,” Malkin said.

Trump, Malkin said, must be vigilant in changing immigration policy and statute:

Here’s my fear, is that you know the conventional establishment talking point this week on immigration — even as these hordes of people are coming in unprecedented numbers — is ‘Oh, we got a few billion from the Pentagon for the fencing.’ And it just lulls the base into this false sense of hope that something is being done when we could have Congresspeople in Washington, themselves, putting pressure on Trump to exercise his inherent executive authority to actually do more than just put a few more dozen miles of physical barriers. And I’m not saying that we don’t need [a wall] but what needs to happen is that the policies need to change. [Emphasis added]

As Breitbart News has chronicled, the U.S. is set to admit anywhere between one to 1.5 million illegal aliens this year. The Trump administration’s most recent expansion of the Catch and Release policy has resulted in the release of about 24,000 border crossers and illegal aliens in just two weeks. Simultaneously, experts project that at the current rate of illegal immigration, up to 500,000 illegal aliens could successfully cross into the country this year, undetected by Border Patrol.

Republican voters rank deporting illegal aliens and ending illegal immigration as their top priority to ensure a better quality of life for themselves and their middle class families, the latest Pew Research Center survey revealed.

Nor am I going to cover truly banal stuff, such as how tiny Bangladesh has more people than Russia. Nor particularly controversial stuff such as Eurabia, Great Replacement, etc. which I have covered elsewhere.

For all of this you have websites like Our World in Data and books by Steven Pinker.

I am instead going to focus on the truly little known and esoteric that I happen to find most interesting, especially from a historical or futurist perspective.

(1) The world population of Greeks has been steady at ~10 million since the age of Alexander the Great. Their percentage of the world total plummeted from ~5% to slightly more than 0.1% today.

Source: Hansen, Mogens Herman. 2008. “An Update on the Shotgun Method.” Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies 48 (3): 259–86.

(2) In 1900, Europe’s population (~400M) was quintuple that of Sub-Saharan Africa’s (~80M).

By 2100, Sub-Saharan Africa’s population (~4B) will be eight times as great as Europe’s (~650M).

(3a) Comparing the populations of modern nation-states to their medieval (pre-Black Death) counterparts is a fascinating exercise:
• France grew only 3x from ~20M to today’s ~65M
• Byzantines-Greeks remained at just ~10M (see above)

(3b) So despite the vast losses of Russia’s demographic potential during the 20th century, it still did rather well in the long-term, increasing its share of Europe’s population from ~5% to ~20% (~25% if inc. UKR/BEL). Swapped places with France in this respect. Glory to the musket and the potato!

(3c) At a larger scale, while both Europe and China were at ~100M in Middle Ages, now China has twice as many people, 1.4B to 700M. The advantages of backwardness – delayed fertility transition left more time for population to soar.

(4) France was the world’s first modern nation to undergo the fertility transition. It had its genesis with the French nobility during 18C. Subsequently, France would fall from having 1/5 Europe’s population in Middle Ages to <10% by late 19C.

Source: Spolaore, Enrico, and Romain Wacziarg. 2019. “Fertility and Modernity.” Working Paper Series. National Bureau of Economic Research.

(5) Huge demographic losses on the level of World War II in Eastern Europe were typical in the Malthusian era.
• 30 Years War in Germany, Mongol invasion of Russia and Persia, reduced their populations by a third.
• Wars & anarchy accompanying the end of dynasties usually killed 33%-50% of Chinese.

(6) Were the Turks the big demographic winners of the 20th century?
• 2017: 80.8M Turks vs. 13.7M Greeks+Armenians (6:1) & ~150M in RF – secure as never before.

(7) The population ratio between Russia and the Ukraine fell from less than 3:1 to almost 5:1 since 1992. It is ironic that Ukrainian independence has been worse for Ukraine’s population balance vis-a-vis Russia than anything that Lazar Kaganovich and the Nazis did.

(8a) Russia just within its current borders, assuming otherwise analogous fertility and migration trends, would have had 261.8 million people by 2017 without the triple demographic disasters of Bolshevism, WW2, and the 1990s – that’s double its actual population of 146 million.

(8b) According to my very rough calculations, based on various sources, the population change for each of the following in their current borders between 1913/14 and 1945/46 was about as follows:

Assuming a threefold expansion in all of these populations, we could have been looking to a Russian Empire or Republic with a further ~120M fully Russified Belorussians and largely Russified Ukrainians, for a total Slavic population of almost 400M.

That’s twice bigger than the number of White Americans today, the most populous single European ethnicity, and almost as much as all of today’s Western Europe.

(8c) Total population of a hypothetical Russian Empire that also retained Central Asia and the Caucasus, and that hadn’t been bled white by commies, Nazis, and Westernizers during the course of the 20th century, would likely have been not that far off from Dmitry Mendeleev’s 1906 projection of 594 million for 2000.

Source: Understanding Russia by Dmitry Mendeleev (yes, the chemist).

(9) So far as I can tell, the Latvians, Estonians, and Ashkenazi Jews are the only peoples with fewer people today than in 1914. It is ironic that they played the most disproportionate roles (per capita) in cementing Bolshevism in Russia. God must really hate commies.

(10) That said, the Irish have an even more extreme and unique anti-record: There are fewer of them today (~6.6M in all Ireland) than in 1840 (8.5M)! I wonder what they did to anger God so.

(11) Communism isn’t always an unmitigated demographic disaster. As @Cicerone973 has discovered, for the first time ever, births in Best Korea (25M) probably overtook South Korea (52M) last year.

(Even if, as Myers argued, Songun/Juche has almost zilch to do with Marxism).

(12) The wonders of Maoism: Between 1960 and 1978, the share of China’s urban population FELL from 20% to 18%.

(13) We have no solid idea if China’s TFR is ~1.6 children per woman, ~1.1 children per woman, or anywhere in between, e.g. see here, here, and here.

This seems rather important given China’s importance.

(14a) Russia’s middle-aged male mortality in the 1990s and early 2000s was worse than under late Tsarism. In particular, alcohol abuse accounted contributed to about a third of all deaths. (This has all since drastically improved).

(14b) Contra Pinker, Russia has seen a “de-civilizing” process in terms of homicide rates (and many other indicators of social wellbeing) in the last third of the 20th century. This was perfectly correlated with its alcoholization epidemic.

In recent years, the Russian homicide rate has retreated back to its pre-1965 “steady state” of ~5/100,000.

Of course, there is still plenty of lost ground, since c.1900 Russia’s rates were similar to those of Italy, Finland, and Japan, whereas all these countries are now at least 5x less violent.

(14c) During the later Soviet era, the Ukraine consistently had a 2 years higher life expectancy than Russia – a difference that dates back well to the 19th century (probably on account of them drinking less, even back then).

But Ukraine has been stagnating since early 2010s; still below its 1960s all time peak, Russia overtook by 2018.

(15) Central Asians went from 10% of Russian population in 1914 to half today, while births have almost equalized since the early 1990s.

Central Asians increasingly looking to work in South Korea, which is ~20 years ahead of China in terms of demographic and socio-economic development. Once China’s urbanization maxes out at ~75-80% by ~2040, I expect labor migration from C. Asia to reorient there.

""I had always had a keen interest in fitness and health and I was determined to find a way to nourish my body to look and feel younger,"" she told The Sun.

Lesley's way of becoming a fitness influencer is quite unusual and even unique as she became a personal trainer at the age of 48 and only then did she fall in love with the wellness world. One year later, when she was 49 - Maxwell won her first fitness figure competition. However, she claims that her interest in healthy living and strength training has been lifelong.

""I used to love being strong and winning bets with boys that I could lift more than them,"" she said. ""My mom used to tell me 'Boys don't like girls with muscles' - but I know they did!""

As of today, Lesley has over 30 bodybuilding titles. The fit grandma claims that she has never felt more ""ageless"". It's not a surprise that Lesley is popular among younger man, who are attracted not only to her stunning body but also to her confident personality.

""I'm always approached by younger men, I feel ageless so it works,"" she said. ""All of my partners have been younger than me, including my ex-husband, whom I had a 13-year age gap with."" ""I'm much happier and confident in myself now than when I was younger, especially since I have made many friends through the gym and competing,"" Lesley continued.

The grandmother of three continues to work hard in the gym and keeps a diet routine. She said that she wants to inspire women of all ages to improve their body and spirit with the help of a fitness-focused life.

917959,theseattletimes,"ESTEPONA, Spain (AP) — In the sunshine outside a large convention center in the southern Spanish city of Estepona, some very fit-looking people in scanty clothing applied fake tans and rehearsed statuesque poses.

They all had one thing in mind: to win Spain’s annual national bodybuilding championship.

This year’s 51st edition, organized by the Spanish Bodybuilding Federation, drew more than 500 contestants from across the country. It took place over two days.

Most of the contestants came with other members of their clubs or teams. They helped apply the fake tans, directed poses and gave last-minute tips to the contestants.

The center buzzed with people getting ready, resting on mats or exercising. Contestants did push-ups, lifted weights, drank protein shakes and ate from lunchboxes.

On the stage, a presenter entertained the audience, and loud techno music was played to encourage contestants during performances.

Men and women, sorted by weight or height, smiled broadly at the panel of judges while presenting their best poses.

Backstage, the next group of nervous contestants waited to walk onto the stage. Some did last-minute exercises to pump up their muscles, others posed in front of a mirror. There was not much interaction among them — all were completely focused on making an impression on the judges and reaching the final round.

Five couples took part in a Couples’ Bodybuilding competition. The first round consisted of posing as the judges ordered; then it was time for each couple to perform a chosen routine.

There were some basic dance moves, interspersed with calculated poses rehearsed to perfection, all to the rhythm of music.

The Daily Express tells how Boris Johnson has put the government on full alert, ordering daily emergency planning summits. The Daily Telegraph says there will be three new committees to accelerate preparations.

And the Times reports Mr Johnson briefed cabinet yesterday on a stripped-down Whitehall structure under which Michael Gove would take day-to-day control.

The HuffPost UK website says the prime minister is understood to want to improve on the way previous committees operated, because he believed they did not move fast enough.

Mr Johnson is set to give European leaders the cold shoulder, according to the Daily Mail, as he ramps up preparations.

A senior government source tells the paper he has no plans to visit European capitals in the hope of reopening talks.

How much of what is happening is a concerted attempt to get the country ready for leaving without a deal or merely posturing to show Brussels that the UK is serious about doing this remains to be seen, suggests the i.

The Guardian focuses on a report from a think-tank, the Institute for Government, which predicts Mr Johnson's domestic agenda will be crushed by the pressing needs of the emergency that would follow a no-deal Brexit.

The i highlights another aspect of the report - that a disorderly Brexit would place unprecedented pressure on the Union.

Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning

As Mr Johnson prepares to visit Scotland, several papers look at what the PoliticsHome website calls the tense relationship between him and the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson.

The Scotsman suggests the visit threatens to be overshadowed by a major clash, after she said she could not back leaving the EU without a deal.

The Times thinks Mr Johnson's encounter with Ms Davidson is likely to be bruising. But, the paper adds, the prime minister's team have offered to take soundings on policies which will ""push Scotland"".

And the Scottish Daily Mail predicts Mr Johnson will fly into a political storm, saying they will meet this afternoon to ""clear the air"".

The Financial Times highlights a warning from the finance secretary in Hong Kong that the mass demonstrations there over the past two months are taking their toll on the economy.

Meanwhile the Telegraph feels the Chinese state will find the democratic imperative hard to quell in Hong Kong just as President Putin will in Russia.

The Times argues the mass arrest of Russian protestors on Saturday is no long-term guarantee of political stability.

The prime minister's creation of the first government office to care for veterans of the armed forces is a step in the right direction, the Sun says.

Mr Johnson has appointed the former Army officer, Johnny Mercer, as Veterans' Minister.

There are many photos of 15-year-old Jaden Ashman, who has won nearly £1m after coming second with his team-mate in the first World Cup of the computer game, Fortnite.

The Mail tells how his mother - like many others - had often despaired of her son's obsession with computer games. Desperate to make him concentrate on his homework instead of staring at a screen, she at one point threw out his games console and snapped his headset.

219797,freedombunker,"“Since I am experienced [in sewing], tonight I am working on a special project making rape resistant shower curtains for the prisons.” – Craig Cesal

Craig Cesal is serving a life sentence in federal prison for doing body work on trucks that were moving marijuana, a first-time offense. Our public servants would not let him out to see his son's funeral. Rapists and murderers have come and gone during his time in America's prison camps. He often works 16-hour shifts sewing for the US government, he says, making “rape resistant” shower curtains.

Craig's exile inside the belly of our government reveals things that remain hidden to us free folks on the outside. What human creatures make others sew rape-resistant showers for fellow captives to hide behind? Who in their right mind made this kind of legal system? Why do millions of Americans take rape-adjacent showers every night in local, state, and federal warehouses for nonviolent choices? Why do Americans think the evil of throwing humans into cages for victimless acts is okay if a majority of group-thinkers complies?

Our government is built on the threat of rape. Every law against nonviolent choices—from suspended licenses to raw milk regulations to workplace rules and coming speech codes—are enforced by the threat of deprivation of freedom, family separation, and, ultimately, assault and rape.

The more our justice rituals fail to bring prosperity, peace, and fairness, the more unsatisfying their cover stories become.

We all know this to some degree but because it is not in our face and because others tolerate it, we remain locked in a societal bystander effect. We are incapable of moving to our neighbors' defense. Just as Stanley Milgram's disturbing experiment showed, most humans tend to go along with the rules of dominance and submission games as long as they are told it is okay by an authority and that they will not be held individually responsible.

But the more we see the failure of prohibitions and regulations and taxation to make our world better at the expense of the sacrificed few, the more the shame of our compliance builds. This shame is supposed to be safely contained on the backs of our designated scapegoats: our prisoners and policemen and soldiers sent to unnecessary decades-long wars. But the more our justice rituals fail to bring prosperity, peace, and fairness, the more unsatisfying their cover stories become. The shame is leaking onto all of us. It is seeping into all of our institutions. Social media sites are flooded with daily shame mob battles of rage. Even football has become stained with the shame of concussions, battered wives, and police shootings.

We have nowhere to hide from shame. The left was quick to try to quarantine their minds from the shame storm of recent stories of refugee children being placed in cages. When popular images of migrant children wrapped in foil in kennel-like enclosures turned out to be the doing of their adored role model Obama, they quickly shielded their minds from the painful realization that they hired this man, most of them two times, to carry out this behavior on their behalf and largely stayed silent.

Nevertheless, many faithful voters persist that the children in cages at the border were solely the shame of Trump voters. Like playing a game of hot potato that can sear a hole through their chests, those who see themselves as morally better than their politically incorrect nemeses feel the need to dump all responsibility for caging and family separation onto their rivals.

Just like their Republican rivals before them, when their tribal leaders pitched elective wars for obviously dubious reasons, they submitted.

But the shame cannot be contained. Leftists know they supported politicians who destroyed Yemeni, Syrian, and Libyan children for no defensible reason. They know they share the blame for knowingly voting for more mass incarceration-related family separation, drone strikes of children, and other ghastly barbarism in recent elections. And just like their Republican rivals before them, when their tribal leaders pitched elective wars for obviously dubious reasons, they submitted. Now they stand up to their knees in shame with nowhere to drain it.

The Covington Catholic schoolboys were a promising target for shame shifting. Their smiles in the face of an elderly Native American's drumming felt like an obvious symbol of unrepentant shame. Finally, millions could relieve their own cauldron of shame for choices like voting for drug war politicians and status quo keepers of political prison camp laborers like Craig Cesal. Then the mob fervor was sabotaged by alternative cameras that revealed the relative composure the teenagers showed in the face of bee-lining grandstanding adults and slurs from another group.

Of course, President Trump has been a perennial target of people full of shame. But he fails to be an effective outlet because he is so shameless. He refuses to indicate the posture of guilt for anything. A cleansing requires the accused to admit sin so that the accusers can feel comparatively exonerated. Trump simply will not play this role. Meanwhile, he himself places the shame of creeping debt and socialism onto the backs of his rival party while conveniently doing little to allow young people to opt out of failed socialist schemes like Medicare and Social Security.

It is popular in culture to be ashamed of race, gender, family togetherness, marriage, children, wealth, competence, able bodies, technology, language, religion, nationality, fitness, and meat. Each of these categories are occasions for difference and differentiation is where people can sometimes engage in shameful behavior. Shame is driving us to erase all differences and boundaries and thus erase all meaning behind these categories of life.

Perhaps the way to relieve our shame is to realize it need not exist at all. Shame exists because we refuse to trust in the sovereign power of love.

But if children could vote, and white men became a tiny impoverished minority of the population, and gender became completely fluid, and wealth was equally printed out to every human in the land, and religion was privatized and pluralized, and meat was completely grown in labs, and body shapes had no preference, would we still bomb a country that threatened our world reserve currency? Would we still place dissidents of new regulations and speech codes in cages with rapists and murderers? Would we wrap our jails with barbed wire fences or cotton candy? Would we reform the prisons we kept by forcing misfits of our new undifferentiated glory into reeducation programs meant to reform their minds for their own good? What if they fled the classroom? Would they be tranquilized or hugged by social justice correctional officers?

Would we still be submerged in shame?

Perhaps the only way to relieve our shame is to realize it need not exist at all. Shame exists because we refuse to trust in the sovereign power of love. Love requires us to unplug from toxic groupthink and reclaim our personhood. When we love ourselves, we can learn to love our neighbors as ourselves. When we care for ourselves, we will not want to initiate physical suffering on others. When we are free of shame, we will have nothing but love left for our neighbors. We will not hide behind collective complacency with violence against misfits. We will be free.

330773,nationalreview,"I have been a Chase Bank customer for years. Who knows how much longer it’ll be? Will the company’s thought police come for me next? How about you? If you are a non-leftist who does business with the financial giant owned by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., you need to ask questions and get answers.

On Tuesday, investigative journalist James O’Keefe and his Project Veritas team released a disturbing new video on the runaround that Chase officials gave Texas conservative entrepreneur Enrique Tarrio about his canceled account. Big business may very well be enabling America’s very own version of the Chinese social-credit system in which political dissent is flagged, shunned, punished, and eradicated.

Tarrio is a young, peaceful, Afro-Cuban freethinker and chairman of the Proud Boys organization. In February 2019, the Texas Trump supporter received a letter from Chase Bank informing him that “after careful consideration,” the financial institution could “no longer support” his banking account. The notice followed a hit piece against minorities who support the president by The Daily Beast, a reliable echo chamber for the discredited Southern Poverty Law Center smear machine.

Tarrio was subsequently kicked off Chase’s payment processor, which he used to sell patriotic and pro-Trump T-shirts. Next, he was deplatformed from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Airbnb, FirstData, Square, Stripe, and PayPal before losing his bank accounts. When I asked on Twitter in February why we can’t have just one financial institution that doesn’t cave to social-justice warriors, the official Chase Twitter account tweeted me back:

“Hi Michelle, this article is inaccurate. We did not close his personal account. We do not close accounts based on political affiliation.”

I pointed out that Chase’s letter clearly stated that the company had closed his account. “So if not for political reasons,” I asked, “why, ‘after careful consideration,’ did you close his account?” The social-media manager of Chase’s corporate Twitter account, previously so eager to spill the tea, replied: “For privacy reasons, we can’t say more.”

Thanks to Project Veritas, we now know more. Undercover audio and video exposed how:

Others who received Chase shutdown notices so far in 2019: conservative Rebel Media contributor Martina Markota, anti-sharia and pro-borders investigative journalist Laura Loomer, and U.S. Army combat vet and vocal Trump supporter Joe Biggs. Were Markota’s, Loomer’s, and Biggs’s removals “clerical” errors or unfounded, or were they based on an ideological litmus test disguised as a “moral character” assessment?

How exactly is J.P. Morgan Chase’s $500,000 donation last year to the SPLC left-wing operatives being put to use?

Why did the company embrace a known defamation racket whose stated mission is to “destroy” its political enemies on the right?

What comment does Chase have now that SPLC’s top leaders have been purged amid internal accusations of intolerance and discrimination within the walls of the notorious Poverty Palace?

Does Chase keep tabs on high-profile conservative customers’ political speech on social-media platforms?

Is Chase operating from the same playbook as Paypal, which is booting off conservatives in consultation with the SPLC? One of its most recent victims: Luke Rohlfing, a young reporter for BigLeaguePolitics.com, who had exposed how the payment processor was allowing Open Borders Inc. heavyweight Pueblo Sin Fronteras to raise money for illegal-immigrant caravans conspiring to break our immigration laws — even though Paypal’s own terms of service state clearly that users may not engage in any activities that “violate any law, statute, ordinance, or regulation.”

Tarrio warns of the speech-squelching pattern emerging across Silicon Valley and on Wall Street: “First we get silenced on social media, then Paypal, then I get debanked. It’s a very dangerous trend.”

He is not alone. Former Toronto mayoral candidate and social-media commentator Faith Goldy told me: “To date I’ve been banned from: PayPal, Patreon, GoFundMe, Airbnb, Facebook, and Instagram. I’ve committed no crime! My only fault is loving my country and quoting government statistics to a camera from my kitchen table. The nature of big-tech censorship is imperialistic, and these Silicon Valley nerds won’t stop until every freethinker is snuffed or scared into submission.”

As for Chase Bank, I sent all my questions to chief communications officer Patricia Wexler, who challenged the authenticity of one of the employees recorded by Veritas (O’Keefe showed proof of the Chase New York media relations number dialed and had audio of the employee identifying himself as a Chase rep) and ignored the substance of the report.

116164,collectiveevolution,"This article was originally published under the heading ‘Are Western Doctors Compelled To Support The Vaccine Industry?‘ If you have not read the article, it is included in full below and highly recommended. Otherwise, you can skip down to see an an update from a Facebook Post by Catie Clobes, the mother whose baby died 36 hours after the scheduled 6-month vaccines.

What is most shocking about the story, and what Catie elaborates on so eloquently and poignantly in her posts, is that despite promising otherwise, doctors did not investigate any possible link between baby Evee’s death and the vaccines, preferring to label her cause of death ‘undetermined.’

If we take a broad overview of the structure of conventional medicine in our Western societies, we are left with an inescapable conclusion: it is set up as a business, where profit is most highly valued and human health and safety is secondary. The evidence for this is overwhelming and is discussed in greater detail in many of our articles on the subject listed at the end of this article.

This is absolutely not to say that there are not loving, upstanding people who are doctors, researchers, or otherwise as part of the Western medical establishment. Not at all. I believe most of them are. However, when it comes specifically to the family doctors and pediatricians who are trusted by their patients to make recommendations for their patients’ health and well-being, there is a limit to how far they can push the boundaries of the highly controlled business structure they find themselves in.

This is probably most obvious when it comes to vaccines. I don’t think any doctor could tell me straight-faced that if they decided that vaccines were not safe for their patients, and they were openly vocal about it in public, that there wouldn’t be pushback from their industry, including intimidation and threats of losing their medical license. And so, unfortunately, there is a built-in bias from the start, and doctors know that going down the path of truly doing their own independent research into the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, in order to make an informed decision about what they will recommend to their patients, will either be a lot of work for nothing or will end up with them having to fight against their powerful establishment and risk losing their livelihood.

But haven’t doctors been thoroughly and convincingly shown already in Medical school the overwhelming proof that vaccines are safe and effective? There is somewhat of a misconception that the public is under about the process by which would-be doctors become convinced about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines:

Despite questioning the safety and efficacy of vaccination by reputable medical men since its introduction, debate has been, and is, increasingly discouraged. Information published in scientific journals is used to support this position, other views being regarded as “unscientific.” It was a received “article of faith” for me and my contemporaries, that vaccination was the single most useful health intervention that had ever been introduced. Along with all my medical and nursing colleagues, I was taught that vaccines were the reason children and adults stopped dying from diseases for which there are vaccines. We were told that other diseases, such as scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, typhus, typhoid, cholera, and so on, for which there are no vaccines at the time, diminished both in incidence and mortality (ability to kill) due to better social conditions. You would think–as medical students who are supposed to be moderately intelligent–that some of us would have asked, “But if deaths from these diseases decreased due to improved social conditions, mightn’t the ones for which there are vaccines also have decreased at the same time for the same reason?” But we didn’t. The medical curriculum is so overloaded with information that you just have to learn what you hear, as you hear it: nonvaccinatable diseases into the social conditions box and vaccinatable diseases into the vaccines box and then onto the next subject.–Dr. Jayne L. M. Donegan, foreward to Suzanne Humphries’ Dissolving Illusions

Having been convinced that vaccines are effective without spending any time looking critically at objective (not industry-funded) studies, doctors are led to treat the matter of the safety of vaccines as a foregone conclusion. This is notwithstanding the publicly available fact that the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act has paid approximately $4 billion to families with vaccine injured children, and that only accounts for 1 percent of vaccine injured children. This is a fact that doctors are not informed about by their industry, and those who become aware of it are almost compelled to wilfully ignore. You can read more about that act and access direct primary sources here.

Vaccines, the industry will repeat until the cows come home, ARE SAFE. PERIOD. Yes, there are extremely rare exceptions when they do cause damage, the industry admits when pressed on the matter, but because they argue that vaccines are so important to societal health, the industry will continue to say with unwavering certainty that VACCINES ARE SAFE. Consequently, while they are afforded a narrow bit of leeway for de-combining vaccines and delaying schedules, the solemn duty of doctors is to promote the safety of vaccines to their patients.

This is all fine and dandy for doctors. Until one of their young patients have serious adverse reactions or even dies after receiving vaccines. Much as many doctors would be heartbroken and would like to offer true love and support to the parents, the position they have been put in by the medical industry forces them to sternly deny the possibility that vaccines could be the cause of the damage, not because logic dictates so, but because they fear that their future career is dependent on this denial.

I recently came upon a Facebook post from March 22nd made by a woman named Catie Clobes that was actually the inspiration for this article. Her daughter Evee Gayle Clobes had tragically died on March 1st, a day and a half after receiving six vaccines at her six month doctor’s visit. The post below, from this brave woman looking for answers as to why her daughter died, explains it all:

Me: “I know this is going to sound morbid, but it sounds like with everything you’re saying to me, my daughter basically “took one for the team”, right?” Pathologist: “I don’t even know what to say to that.” I just finished up a very heated, baffling phone conversation with the very “cold” doctor who performed my daughter’s autopsy. The autopsy is pretty much complete on their end, there have been no answers, it’s at a finalizing paperwork phase. My mother was in the room when this call took place, she heard this all! I’m not exaggerating a thing. After several calls this week to try and get this doctor on the phone, I sent an email today requesting the simple additional tests that I wanted done in my daughter’s autopsy. I was assured the day of my daughter’s death by that office that “every test” would be performed, that her receiving vaccinations a day and a half prior was of concern, and they’d be running “those kinds of tests”, that they took infant deaths very seriously. I believed them. These simple tests I requested would reveal if vaccinations had played any part in my daughter’s death. Well less than an hour after sending that email, I finally got that doctor to call me back! She refused to do the tests, each and every one. Me: “My daughter was in perfect health and then received 6 vaccinations and died a day and a half later. Why wouldn’t you run ANY tests to check if vaccinations were the cause?” Pathologist: “It’s not medically necessary, there is no medical reasoning, and it’s not medically approved.” No kidding, she said this!! She refused to acknowledge that it might even be a possibility that it was the cause! State or County Medical Examiner offices refuse and will not run any tests in an autopsy that could reveal any link to vaccination as the cause of death because it is not “medically accepted.” This is a fact. They will put SIDS on the death certificate before running of these tests. At this point, being an angry, grieving mother, I said some controversial things to try and get some sort of sensible answer out of this woman. She was like a robot. I said to her, “It sounds like you’re just reading me some script the CDC and the government have given you!” I cried in disbelief and anger. I yelled, “If this was your baby that you just lost, you’d want answers no matter what it took.” I asked her opinion on why so many shots had to be given to such a small child? She never once gave any opinion. She kept repeating that science and research shows this and that, but none of it made sense. She had nothing to say about vaccination inserts saying that “SIDS” can occur, and all the other warnings. She had no solid fact, reasoning, nothing educational or productive. I couldn’t even believe I was speaking with a doctor. It was clear she was watching her words. I told her I didn’t believe in “SIDS” and that every death has a real reason behind it. She had nothing to say to that. What was NOT surprising was that a pause of hesitation came before each of her responses. She actually started to say to me “Listen, you are a part of a community that…” and I stopped her and I said “NO! I have vaccinated all of my children. I have always trusted medical professionals. I was never told by any doctor that more than a fever could occur after my babies getting their shots. I never knew any better because people like you shame that “community” and silence them. Don’t label me to try and discredit what I’m saying. I was “provaxx” just like you until I sadly had to find out in the worst way possible how many babies and children have died and been hurt by these shots.” That’s when I made the “take one for the team statement”. My last words to her were “you should be ashamed, you’re a doctor, and it’s your job to find answers and save lives and that’s not what you are doing.” There was silence on her end and then I hung up. I’m making nothing up. This is not “stuff” I’m hearing, this is what I am living. I understand the need for vaccinations, I get the government’s reasoning, the importance. Sure. The lack of care, lack of research, lack of information about gene testing and titer level testing to prevent injuries and deaths, lack of any TRUTH or answers, and the lack of any real accountability when it comes to the negative, that I don’t understand. The corruption – that is what blows my mind. So I will continue on my fight for the answer I am looking for. I’m just also on a mission to expose and share with everyone the crazy, sick truth I am experiencing along the way. (That’s what this post is about.) Mommy has got your back, my “Eeves Peeves”! She always has and she always will. #justiceforevee

One of the reasons we talk about vaccine injuries so much at CE is because they provide us with a clear window into the true motives and values of the powerful forces at the top of the medical industry, and who are just part of a larger group that control all facets of Western society.

It is sad and unfortunate that people like Catie Clobes continue to experience the injuries or deaths of cherished loved ones, just because we have a medical industry that puts profits above human health and safety. We do the most service to these people by supporting their efforts, sharing their stories, raising awareness, and aiming for a future in which our entire medical industry holds fast to the prime directive to ‘first, do no harm.’

Since the article above was written, Catie Clobes got final confirmation that the role of vaccines in her baby’s death was not investigated, and that the cause of death on Evee’s death certificate was ‘undetermined.’ I could go on about this, but Catie’s words in a later Facebook post carry much more weight on this than mine ever could:

– Evee ? was 100% healthy a day and a half before she passed as she was her whole life. – Evee ? had an appointment a day and a half before she passed and at that appt. I was asked if Evee was getting her vaccinations and I replied “yes” and not before or after was I given any information about adverse reactions of immunizations that are listed on the vaccinations’ inserts (including death) which I now know are overwhelming – Evee ? was given SIX vaccinations (research ingredients in vaccinations quick, if ya don’t know) in the form of 2 shots in each leg. I was clueless mother, doing what I thought was right for my baby. She was 15.1 lbs that day. ? – Evee’s nurse carelessly misdocumented the location she put the shots which I found out after she had passed (this was corrected after intervention) as if she was just “another patient poked”. – Evee ? had no symptoms. I found her peaceful, lifeless body March 1st, 2019, less than a day and a half after her shots. – Insignificant single mother (me) ✋ was promised every test and measure would be taken to determine the cause of her death, including vaccination-related testing, by the medical examiner’s office, right away. – I requested specific tests, vital to the determination of vaccines being the cause of death and was REFUSED these tests by the medical examiner/doctor. Flat out refused. How could a healthy baby just die, and doctors and the State of Minnesota, are OK with telling me “undetermined” was the cause of death in my daughter, after all of these facts? I’m sick. This is beyond wrong. Do you know there is a Federal fund set up to “pay off” families in situations like this?????? ? Wake up, friends who KNOW me, this is all real!! My best friend is gone and these are the facts!! ?? For those who are concerned about vaccine safety and the current push for mandatory vaccination, I would recommend that you follow Catie Clobes in her search for the truth on her Facebook page linked above. The latest news is that she will be building a website devoted to ‘Justice for Evee’. She is a brave young woman and she is fighting for truth and justice on a matter that affects us all.",Update: Mother Enraged As Cause Of Baby’s Death 36 Hours After Vaccination Ruled ‘Undetermined’,society,social condition,2410
3572,abcnews,"Richard J. Poster served time for possessing child pornography, violated his probation by having contact with children, admitted masturbating in the bushes near a church school and in 2005 was put on a sex offender registry. And yet the former Catholic priest was only just this month added to a list of clergy members credibly accused of child sexual abuse — after The Associated Press asked why he was not included.

Victims advocates had long criticized the Roman Catholic Church for not making public the names of credibly accused priests. Now, despite the dioceses’ release of nearly 5,300 names, most in the last two years, critics say the lists are far from complete.

An AP analysis found more than 900 clergy members accused of child sexual abuse who were missing from lists released by the dioceses and religious orders where they served.

The AP reached that number by matching those public diocesan lists against a database of accused priests tracked by the group BishopAccountability.org and then scouring bankruptcy documents, lawsuits, settlement information, grand jury reports and media accounts.

More than a hundred of the former clergy members not listed by dioceses or religious orders had been charged with sexual crimes, including rape, solicitation and receiving or viewing child pornography.

On top of that, the AP found another nearly 400 priests and clergy members who were accused of abuse while serving in dioceses that have not yet released any names.

“No one should think, ‘Oh, the bishops are releasing their lists, there’s nothing left to do,’” said Terence McKiernan, co-founder of BishopAccountability.org, who has been tracking the abuse crisis and cataloging accused priests for almost two decades, accumulating a database of thousands of priests.

“There are a lot of holes in these lists,” he said. “There’s still a lot to do to get to actual, true transparency.”

Church officials say that absent an admission of guilt, they have to weigh releasing a name against harming the reputation of priests who may have been falsely accused. By naming accused priests, they note, they also open themselves to lawsuits from those who maintain their innocence.

Earlier this month, former priest John Tormey sued the Providence, Rhode Island, diocese, saying his reputation was irreparably harmed by his inclusion on the diocese’s credibly accused list. After the list was made public, he said he was asked to retire by the community college where he had worked for over a decade.

Some dioceses have excluded entire classes of clergy members from their lists — priests in religious orders, deceased priests who had only one allegation against them, priests ordained in foreign countries and, sometimes, deacons or seminarians ousted before they were ordained.

Others, like Poster, were excluded because of technicalities.

Poster’s name was not included when the Davenport, Iowa, diocese issued its first list of two dozen credibly accused priests in 2008. The diocese said his crime of possessing more than 270 videos and images of child pornography on his work laptop was not originally a qualifying offense in the church’s landmark charter on child abuse because there wasn’t a direct victim.

After he was released from prison, the diocese found Poster a job as a maintenance man at its office, but he was fired less than a year later after admitting to masturbating in the bushes on the property, which abuts a Catholic high school. Still, the diocese did not list him.

Poster went on to violate the terms of his probation, admitting he had contact with minors at a bookstore and near an elementary school, federal court records unsealed at the AP’s request show. A judge sent him back to jail for two months and imposed several other monitoring conditions.

Child pornography was added to the church’s child abuse charter in 2011 and, though the diocese promised it would update its list of perpetrators as required under a court-approved bankruptcy plan, it never included Poster.

“It was an oversight,” diocese spokesman Deacon David Montgomery told the AP. He said the public had been kept informed about the case through press releases issued from Poster’s arrest until his removal from the priesthood in 2007.

Poster, now 54, lives in Silver Spring, Maryland, near a school and two parks. He hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing for more than a decade and declined to comment when reached by the AP, saying he preferred to stay out of the spotlight.

Of the 900 unlisted accused clergy members, more than a tenth had been charged with a sex-related crime — a higher percentage than those named publicly by dioceses and orders, the AP found.

Dioceses varied widely in what they considered a credible accusation. Like Poster, some of the priests criminally charged with child pornography weren’t listed because some dioceses said a victim needed to report a complaint. In addition to Poster, the AP review found 15 other priests charged with possessing, distributing or creating child pornography who were not included on any list.

Other dioceses created exceptions for a host of other reasons, ranging from cases being deemed not credible by a board of lay church people to the clergy members in question having since died and thus being unable to defend themselves.

“If your goal is protecting kids and healing victims, your lists will be as broad and detailed as possible. If your goal is protecting your reputation and institution, it will be narrow and vague. And that’s the choice most bishops are making,” said David Clohessy, the former executive director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, who now heads the group's St. Louis chapter.

The largest exceptions were made for the nearly 400 priests in religious orders who, while they serve in diocesan schools and parishes, don’t report to the bishops.

Richard J. McCormick, a Salesian priest who worked at parishes, schools and religious camps in dioceses in Florida, New York, Massachusetts, Indiana and Louisiana, has been accused of molesting or having inappropriate contact with children from three states. In 2009, his order settled the first three civil claims against him. Yet he does not appear on any list of credibly accused clergy members.

McCormick finally faced criminal charges after one of his victims spotted the priest’s name on a very different list — one posted in 2011 by a Boston lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, who represents church sexual abuse victims.

Thirty years had gone by, but Joey Covino said he immediately recognized a photo of McCormick as the priest who had molested him over two summers at a Salesian camp, a woodsy retreat for underprivileged boys in Ipswich, Massachusetts. Covino’s boyhood had revolved around church, where he served as an altar boy, played in a Catholic Little League and where his mother — raising four children on her own — gratefully accepted assistance from friendly priests.

When she sent Covino and his brothers back to the free camp for a second year, “I was petrified — petrified — and I couldn’t say anything. I couldn’t even ask my brothers to see if it had happened to them,” said Covino, now 49 and a police officer in Revere, Massachusetts. “I’ve always told myself I should have done something. I should have fought back.”

Covino said the entirety of his adult life had been altered by McCormick’s abuse — failed relationships, his decisions to join the military and later the police, nightmares that plagued him. His decision to come forward led to McCormick being convicted of rape in 2014 and sentenced to up to 10 years. The priest since has pleaded guilty to assaulting another boy.

The Salesians, based in New Rochelle, New York, have never posted a list of credibly accused priests.

“Our men who have been credibly accused and have had accusations have been listed in the various dioceses that we serve,” said Father Steve Ryan, vice provincial of the order.

Ryan said he was certain McCormick’s name appeared on several lists, including Boston’s.

But when Boston posted its list in 2011, Archbishop Sean Patrick O’Malley wrote that he was not including priests from religious orders or visiting clerics because the diocese “does not determine the outcome in such cases; that is the responsibility of the priest’s order or diocese.”

O’Malley since has called on religious orders to post their own lists, spokesman Terry Donilon said.

The AP found the Boston archdiocese has the most accused priests left off its list, with almost 80 not included. Nearly three-quarters, like McCormick, were priests from religious orders. Another dozen died before allegations were received — another exclusion cited by the archdiocese.

McCormick also is not on the New York archdiocese’s list or lists posted by the Archdiocese of Gary, Indiana, and the Diocese of St. Petersburg, Florida — both places where he faced accusations.

After the AP inquired, a spokeswoman for the archdiocese in New Orleans, where McCormick served in 1991, said the archdiocese would seek to verify information about the priest and add him to its list.

If McCormick goes onto New Orleans’ list, he would be excluded from the AP’s undercount analysis, despite still being absent on lists in the other dioceses where he served. Because the AP counted only priests left off all lists, critics say the number of 900 unnamed priests represents just a tiny portion of the true scope of the underreporting problem.

Other priests excluded from the credibly accused lists were left off because of findings from the diocesan investigations process.

Review boards — independent panels in each diocese staffed with lay people to review allegations of abuse — make the initial recommendation on whether an allegation is credible. The standards those boards use to investigate claims and the process itself often is so shrouded from public view that some victims say they weren’t allowed to attend when their allegations were discussed.

Dozens of priests whose accusers received payouts or legal settlements were left off credibly accused lists because review boards deemed the accusations not substantiated or because bishops or even the Vatican later overturned the board’s findings on appeal. The standards for Vatican appeals are even more secretive.

In 2006, the Chicago Archdiocese’s review board investigated a claim from two brothers who alleged a priest named Robert Stepek had abused them. The board found “reasonable cause to suspect that sexual abuse of minors occurred,” but Stepek was restored to good standing in 2013 after a Vatican court said it was “unable to find evidence strong enough.” The court found Stepek engaged in inappropriate behavior for a priest, however, and he remained without an assignment under restrictions until his death in 2016.

The AP found about 45 accused clergy members who did not appear on the Archdiocese of Philadelphia’s list of credibly accused priests. The archdiocese said they were excluded for a variety of reasons, including deciding that about a dozen priests found unsuitable for ministry by a review board due to conduct involving minors did not do anything that rose to the level of abuse.

A spokesman said the archdiocese has a thorough and transparent investigation process, but declined to comment on any of the individual cases of priests not named on its list.

Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro told the AP that he had to fight church leaders to release a groundbreaking 2018 grand jury report that named more than 300 predator priests and cataloged clergy abuse over seven decades in six of the state’s dioceses, not including Philadelphia.

Several bishops played a direct role in covering up the abuse in Pennsylvania, Shapiro said.

“You can’t put much stock in the lists that the church voluntarily provides because they cannot be trusted to police themselves,” he said.

In Buffalo, New York, Bishop Richard Malone resigned under pressure earlier this month after his executive assistant leaked internal church documents to a reporter after becoming concerned the bishop had intentionally omitted dozens of names from its list of credibly accused priests.

Buffalo’s list has more than doubled to 105 clergy members since those documents were released. Still, the AP found nearly three dozen accused priests who remain unnamed by the diocese.

The number of new claims being reported to law enforcement and church officials over the last two years has increased, spurred in part by revelations of abuse from high-ranking church officials such as former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick and by the Pennsylvania grand jury report and the more than 20 other state investigations launched in its wake.

The AP found more than 130 priests who were accused in the last two years whose names do not appear on any lists. Another 37 unlisted priests were accused under New York’s Child Victims Act, which recently opened a window for victims to file civil lawsuits regardless of the statute of limitations, a trend being echoed across the country.

Anne Burke, now chief justice of the Illinois Supreme Court, was part of the Catholic Church’s inaugural National Review Board, a commission formed to help implement the church’s 2002 child abuse charter.

“We gave our report and recommendations over 15 years ago. They never followed through. That was the final nail in the coffin as far as we were concerned in terms of the bishops ever being able to pull themselves away … from the bureaucracy and be transparent,” Burke said. “That is why we are here again today, and it’s worse.”

Many advocates say the church has a long way to go toward being transparent and are determined to see that it becomes far more open about problem priests.

Attorney Jeff Anderson, known for suing dioceses for information on accused clergy, has released almost 30 various rosters of clergy he has received allegations against or whose names appear in church documents.

“We feel a fierce public imperative to continue to release our lists because those released by dioceses contain only a fraction of the true report,” Anderson said. “And they lead people to believe they are coming clean when they are not.”

It was a list that Anderson’s law firm released in the Archdiocese of New York that led 34-year-old Joe Caramanno to file a complaint, decades after he said he was abused.

Caramanno had been hospitalized for an anxiety disorder when he was a teenager and part of his return to high school involved mandated meetings with a priest who controlled his medication. It was during those sessions that Caramanno said Monsignor John Paddack fondled him.

Caramanno, now a teacher, said it wasn’t until he saw Paddack’s name on Anderson’s list that he felt he could come forward. “I needed the validation that it wasn’t just me. It made it more real,” he said.

The archdiocese’s official list of credibly accused priests, released a few months after Anderson’s, contains only half the names and does not include Paddack, who has stepped down during the ongoing investigation.

“It makes me wonder if I hadn’t come forward … would he still be an active priest?” said Caramanno, who has filed a lawsuit against the archdiocese under New York’s Child Victims Act.

An archdiocese spokesman said a request for comment had been relayed to Paddack, but the priest did not respond.

Victims and advocates say the church should be transparent about investigations when allegations are received, arguing that trust in the church can be restored only if bishops are completely forthcoming.

Several dioceses have chosen to include priests under investigation on their lists, removing them if the allegations are determined to be unsubstantiated, but many others do not disclose investigations or include those names.

“Every cleric no matter where they came from or were ordained or went to school or who signs their paycheck ... all of that is hair-splitting and irrelevant,” said Clohessy, of the group SNAP. “What matters is one question: Did or does this credibly accused predator have access to my flock ever? Even for a few hours. If the answer is yes, then that bishop needs to put that predator on his list.”

AP reporters Ryan J. Foley, Adam Geller and Matt Sedensky and researcher Randy Herschaft contributed to this report.",Hundreds of accused clergy left off church's sex abuse lists,religion and belief,religious institutions and state relations,2608
500570,sottnet,"Parents preferred to pay fines and even accept jail terms rather than having their wards vaccinated, particularly as they had previous children who had succumbed

Health and Human Services (HHS) openly admitted to not having filed any vaccine safety reports in over 30 years!""

The concept of intrusive protection has existed since a very long time. They were directed against smallpox as the disease was persistent and deadly. Prior to vaccination there were three practices; olfaction, inoculation and variolation. These failed because of three reasons; they led to serious adverse effects, increased the death rate and helped the disease to spread among populations where they were practiced. By 1728 the medical profession knew very well that these concepts would not work.Therefore when Jenner came out with similar concept eyebrows were raised. The smallpox vaccination was accepted upon a single case of James Phipps who after operation in May 1796 survived a disease challenge, and it was assumed the immunity was for life.. Repeated revaccination was suggested which suited those implementing the practice for a handsome fee.Opposition to the vaccine grew as people witnessed deaths and very serious adverse effects.. Growing rejection of the vaccine and protests against it led to mandates in 1864-68 in Leicester, England leading to the launch of the Anti-Vaccination League in 1870. The Anti-vaccination Society of America came up in 1879.The members were stalwarts from all sections of society and received inputs from the medical profession and public health officials who engaged in documenting vaccination harm, designed pamphlets warning the public, analyzed statistics, and submitted detailed petitions to governments against mandates.The National Anti-Vaccination League of Britain exposed statistical manipulation, ""The Ministry of Health has admitted that the vaccinal condition is a guiding factor in diagnosis."" If a person who is vaccinated comes down with the disease he was protected against, the disease was recorded under another name. Chickenpox measles , rash and eczema were diagnostic options. This increased the efficacy of the vaccine.Many regions including Leicester rejected the vaccine and adopted sanitation, hygiene, isolation and nutrition and the disease rate declined remarkably. Ironically smallpox when it disappeared all over the world disappeared also in regions where people shunned the vaccine and adopted them. It is known the WHO too was forced to adopt these measures alongside.The wave of a future movement was sown in 1943 when Dr. Leo Kanner, a psychiatrist, made a case study of children who suffered from a novel disorder he termed Autism . Documenting details of these thoroughly unresponsive children he mentioned they were vaccinated for smallpox and DPT.However it was an epidemic of encephalopathy observed in children leading to deaths and a lifetime of disability that spurred parents in the USA to question vaccines again. Their anger was not unfounded. As early as 1933 the DPT vaccine was linked by Dr. Madsen to deaths in children. In 1947 Dr. Brody linked it to brain damage . A 1948 study by Dr. Byers et al linked it to deaths, blindness, deafness, spasticity, convulsions, and other severe neurological disorders. There was open admission of guilt by eminent immunologists in a US TV show broadcast in 1982 where children who had turned into vegetables after receiving the shots were also featured. The US vaccine industry faced bankruptcy paying compensation to parents who went to the Court against them. The manufacturers shifted to the acellular pertussis vaccine, the DTaP as it was found the pertussis component was guilty.The anti-vaccine crowd was proven right again.This second wave was dealt with in the most brazen manner possible. The industry approached the US government and pleaded they needed protection or they would go out of business. The government of Ronald Reagan provided limited liability to vaccine manufacturers in October 1986 and set up a federal compensation programme to be funded by an excise duty on each vaccine component that would ironically be borne by the purchaser.The New York Times of 15th November 1986 reported,There still remained a possibility that parents could opt out of the system to sue manufacturers. This loophole was blocked when the US Supreme Court supported the US Congress view in the Bruesewitz v. Wyeth case of 2011. The Court judgement noted, ""No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1,1988, if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.""The pro-vaccination group won and left the industry with no incentive or intention to produce safe and effective vaccines. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was consequently instructed to submit safety reports to the government every year acceding to public concerns. ""The Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN) and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sued the US government in an attempt to reveal the safety reports. According to a legal document entitled, ""Mandate for Safer Childhood Vaccines,""Thus vaccine safety depends upon clinical trials of the manufacturers. How capable are they for revealing adverse effects? ""According to the "" 2013 WHO Expert Consultation on the Use of Placebos in Vaccine Trials "", the following replacements are used in lieu of a true saline placebo: ""In place of a placebo, a vaccine against a disease that is not the focus of the trial is given to participants who do not receive the trial vaccine."" or, an ""add-on"" vaccine can be used: ""In this design, the trial vaccine or placebo product is mixed with an existing vaccine not studied in the trial, and the subjects are given either (a) the trial vaccine mixed with the existing unrelated vaccine or (b) the combination of a placebo and the existing unrelated vaccine."" Thus the trials can never provide a genuine risk assessment.The WHO admits: ""A methodological disadvantage, however, is that trials using these types of placebos provide a less perfect control. It may be difficult or impossible to assess fully the safety and reactogenicity of the trial vaccine."" The reasons offered are vaccines are classified as biological - therefore they do not require stringent safety tests, and it would be unethical to deny the control group the use of a vaccine.This is the same WHO which considers those questioning vaccines to be the greatest public health threat, which has decided to launch a vigorous grassroots campaign to promote vaccines involving all its stakeholders and feels there should be no right to refuse.The third wave of the anti-vaccination movement was focussed on autism discovered in 1943. It appeared in children all over the globe and became unmanageable by the 1990's. The severity is reflected by the fact that in California the prevalence increased 600% in the period 1990 - 2002. It was the parents who raised their voice only to be ridiculed and demonized. They were asked to deny their own eyes as they watched and even video recorded their children regress after taking vaccines.A lot happened during this period. In 3rd April 2000, a study titled ""Autism, a unique type of mercury poisoning"" by Sallie Bernard et al found 200 symptoms of autism to exactly match mercury poisoning and ascribed it to the use of the mercury containing compound Thiomersal in vaccines. Published in Medical Hypotheses in April 2001 after a thorough review, it created quite a stir and was vehemently criticized.The din refused to fade and became shriller still when a freedom of information act petition by David Welden exposed the minutes of a high profile meeting of 51 officials belonging to the CDC, vaccine manufacturers, and highly placed government officials who had met in Simpsonwood, Northcross Georgia, USA on 7th - 8th June 2000 to discuss two CDC studies that found undeniable association between mercury containing vaccines and autism. The relative risk found in both the studies was 7.62; any figure above 1 being a sure indication.CDC correspondence between the author Thomas Verstraeten and top notch scientists revealed he had manipulated the data at his level and unable to do so any further sent an SOS for help, ""The association will not go away."" Consequently the meeting was held where the guests decided to bury the association even as a member conceded his grandchild would not receive vaccines, another expressed concerns over targets to be met, while a third highlighted a similar role of the vaccine adjuvant aluminium which he felt had equally disastrous consequences.Verstraten left the CDC to join the vaccine giant Glaxosmithkline, and one study published in the November 2003 issue of the journal Pediatrics concluded, ""No consistent significant associations were found between TCVs (thiomersal containing vaccines) and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Conflicting results were found at different HMOs for certain outcomes""; in short, nothing to worry. Dr. Mark Geier managed to access the raw data through the freedom of information act and found a relative risk of 7.62 as in the original. The other study showing the same remains with the CDC and is available in its archives.CDC provided a grant to Dr. Poul Thorsen of Denmark to conduct the famous Danish studies. They found that Thiomersal in vaccines and the MMR vaccine were not associated with autism. The studies came under a cloud when a CDC insider squealed that Dr. Thorsen had misappropriated the grant. The case was investigated and Thorsen was found guilty of 22 counts of money laundering and wire fraud in April 2011.US Attorney Quillian Yates remarked, ""This defendant is alleged to have orchestrated a scheme to steal over $1 million in CDC grant money earmarked for autism research. We will now seek the defendant's extradition."" Thorsen remains on the ""Most Wanted"" list of the Office of Inspector General, US DHHS, and awaits extradition as Denmark does not have an extradition treaty with the US. The CDC feels his financial misdemeanour has not affected his scientific integrity and defends the studies.Another investigation was conducted on September 18, 2017. ""The new evidence, uncovered by Children's Health Defense, showed that Thorsen and his collaborators did not obtain permission from an Institutional Review Board (IRB) to conduct their research, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2002 and Pediatrics in 2003. In 2009, when CDC discovered that Thorsen never applied for the IRB approvals, staff did not report the errors and retract the studies. Rather, FOIA documents show that CDC supervisors ignored the missteps and covered up the illegal activity.""The next CDC study to run into a controversy was when Dr. William Thompson, CDC Immunization Safety Researcher, turned whistleblower and handed over 10,000 documents he was asked to destroy to the US Congress that revealed gross incongruities in the CDC DeStefano study published in 2002 that investigated the role of MMR vaccines in autism and refuted the 1998 investigation by Dr. Andrew Wakefield. ""After Dr. Brian Hooker's requests through the Freedom of Information Act for original MMR study documentation Dr. Thompson, the co-author, buckled under the pressure of his conscience to hand over documents that demonstrated a 3.4 fold increase in the incidence of autism in African American boys, expunged from the final study results in an act of scientific fraud."" Dr. Brian Hooker accessed the raw data to confirm the allegations. The matter is currently under Congress investigation.The studies that strongly deny the vaccine autism connection are thus weak in their foundations. It must also trouble us that of the cases of vaccine injury compensated under NVICP, there exist 85 cases of autism awarded for encephalopathy. The association is denied under the plea that they only resemble symptoms of autism. But autism is a symptomatic diagnosis.In 13th January 2019 The Hill reported, ""Pediatric neurologist Dr. Andrew Zimmerman who originally served as the expert medical witness for the government, which defends vaccines in federal vaccine court signed a sworn affidavit. During a group of 5,000 vaccine-autism cases being heard in court on June 15, 2007, he took aside the Department of Justice (DOJ) lawyers he worked for defending vaccines and told them he'd discovered ""exceptions in which vaccinations could cause autism. ""I explained that in a subset of children, vaccine-induced fever and immune stimulation did cause regressive brain disease with features of autism spectrum disorder."" His opinion was based on scientific advances and his own experience with patients."" However his confession was disregarded and the cases dismissed.The anti-vaccine movement spread worldwide with a very strong base when the HPV vaccine against cervical cancer introduced in 2007 became associated with clinical trial fraud, and numerous cases of deaths and serious disabilities. These cases received huge media publicity in Japan, Sweden, UK, Ireland and the USA. The vaccine adverse effect reporting system (VAERS) of the USA reveals up to 14th January 2019, 61,060 adverse events that include 464 deaths and 8936 cases classified as serious. The agencies admit VAERS records 1% of actual.Activists in India filed a case in the Supreme Court when it emerged that PATH and the ICMR had conducted an illegal clinical trial in the year 2009 that killed nine tribal girls and sickened almost every girl that it was administered to defying informed consent norms and local laws.Afrikaners were jolted in November 2014 when the Catholic Doctors Association found evidence from reports of nine accredited laboratories that beta hcg, a birth control hormone, was present in tetanus vaccines being used by WHO and Unicef in Kenya targeting 14 to 49 year old women. ""In February 2018 the Kenyan president Raila Odinga made a public televised statement acknowledging a tetanus vaccine given in 2014 - 2015 to approximately 500,000 women was confirmed to contain a sterilization hormone. The licence of the manufacturer was cancelled.""In 2017 the Philippines erupted in anger when it was revealed that the Dengue vaccine manufactured by Sanofi approved in the country and administered to 800,000 children had ignored a warning that it could increase the cases of severe dengue in persons previously exposed to the disease. The official death toll is 154 as on Sept 26, 2018. Severe internal haemorrhage has been found in many cases. ""Legal authorities have revealed there is a clear case against six Sanofi officials, mostly country representatives of the firm, and 14 current and former Philippine health officials including former Health Minister Janette Garin for 10 confirmed deaths."" Meanwhile the parents of the 800,000 children, and 100,000 more in Brazil, dread the day their wards would come down with dengue.What is the strategy being used to push vaccines into an increasingly unwilling population? It starts with naming vaccines to be ""immunization"" whereas 100% of the suffering population can turn out to be ""fully immunized"" and the discovery of cellular immunity has all but negated this claim in 1944. Portraying vaccines to be about ""public health"" and ""preventive medicine"" when vaccines have been linked so far to 248 diseases and disabilities including death by scientific published studies, and research proves preventing most infectious diseases simply opens the flood gates of chronic disorders . Is it a wonder that people turn against vaccinations?What should be done to stem the crisis? Dr. Pushpa Mittra Bhargava, founder director of The Institute of Cellular and Molecular Biology, had suggested some steps to the author to ensure safe vaccination programmes when he was interviewed in the year 2009 at Secunderabad.There is a system for introducing vaccines into India. Many factors have to be considered. What is the incidence of the disease in the country; are there some regions where it is concentrated? Does the incidence justify a vaccine?These sage words must reverberate in all members of the scientific community who are interested in vaccine safety. We are aware of vaccination warnings being ignored in India. Dr. Vipin Vashishtha, senior executive committee member of the IAP voiced his concern about 15 additional vaccines being given by IAP members. He alleged that the amount of Rs. 25,000 to 30,000 per child that led to annual revenue of Rs. 8100 crores was driving the urge to vaccinate. Dr. Vashistha was physically assaulted at an IAP function and expelled from the IAP for raising his voice.Doctors in India have expressed concerns about the Pentavalent vaccine in the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics, and suggested it could be behind around 8100 deaths annually in Indian children. The WHO responded to the global reports of deaths by revising the reporting system such that the deaths could not be ascribed to the vaccine making Dr. Jacob Puliyel lament, ""Even deaths are no longer a contraindication to vaccination.""An RTI query in 2018 made the Indian government concede 10,612 deaths after vaccinations provided under the universal immunization programme from 2008 to 2018. It also revealed upwards of 600,000 adverse effects are reported every year. Government officials hint at coincidence. The OPV vaccine being given with religious fervour in India has been attributed to 491,704 cases of paralysis in Indian children from 2000 to 2017 and the criticism against the study methodology has been countered effectively. Such figures do not inspire confidence, nor does the response. The private sector in India vaccinates 2.7 million children or more annually and has no monitoring system.Parents in India have approached two High Courts; at Kerala, and New Delhi after children started dying and were hospitalized in hordes after being vaccinated with the measles rubella vaccine in a school based campaign. Deciding on the petitions the clear judgement in both cases has been, the risks have to be revealed and informed written consent taken. Preparations are on to challenge the decisions. It has been acknowledged by government sources that vaccination campaigns cannot succeed unless the parents are kept ignorant and the vaccines forced on the children.Our children are today in a deplorable state. According to a report in The Lancet, 54% of children today suffer from chronic disorders. 1 in 10 children have asthma. 1 in 13 suffers from food allergies. 1 in 6 children suffer from developmental disorders. 1 in 8 suffers severe neurological disorders. The CDC's latest report released in April 2019 reveals 1 in 59 children suffer autism. In the past 8 to 10 years: juvenile diabetes increased by 23%, cancer increased by 29%, ADHD increased by 43%, food allergies increased by 50%, asthma rates rose by almost 50%, Autism increased 150%. There is enough to be worried about.Where is the healthy childhood that vaccines promised? Must a campaign that raises crucial issues, seeks scientific interventions, and expects the medical profession to ensure health be attacked just for being anti-industry?We can no longer ignore the elephant in the room. Vaccination mandates being imposed in the USA in response to anti-vaccination sentiments and the censoring of social media is not the solution.History will judge the custodians of children according to what their response will be at the present moment. Let that decision be sane and scientific. We need courage and determination to face the bullies. Our children are precious, not the profits of an industry that stands exposed.Jagannath Chatterjee is a vaccine researcher and author of a number of articles on the subject that have appeared in newspapers and journals in India.

758661,theindependent,"An Aboriginal man demanding the return of an ancestral shield seized by James Cook in 1770 has become the first living member of his clan to hold it after being invited to a private viewing by the British Museum.

Rodney Kelly is the sixth generational descendent of a warrior called Cooman of the Gweagal clan’s Dharawal tribe.

According to historical documents, the shield was taken by Cook and his marines after Cooman was shot in the leg when the British arrived at Botany Bay, Australia on 29 April 1770.

Ancestral records documenting stories of the altercation between two naked warriors and a group of Englishmen were passed down through generations, Mr Kelly told The Independent.

Made of Australian red mangrove, the 45cm-wide shield ended up in the Cook Collection at the Museum of Mankind – today known as the British Museum.

Speaking about his up-close and personal experience with the shield, Mr Kelly said: “I felt I had a right to stand there and view the artefacts of my ancestor that were taken.

“To go behind the scenes of the British Museum and view the shield and touch it was a very powerful experience.

“I was filled with pride and happiness but then I knew it would have to go back to where it’s been kept. And that really hurts. So it was really emotional knowing I’ve got to walk away.”

Mr Kelly, who lives in Bermagui, New South Wales, launched a campaign to reclaim the shield in 2016 after he saw it had been loaned to Canberra’s National Museum of Australia.

He said he grew up listening to stories about his ancestors from the period of Britiain’s arrival in Australia, and traced his family tree to discover he is a direct descendent of the warrior who was killed.

The dream now, he said, was to get it back home in time for the 250th anniversary of it being taken.

He added the shield represents the British colonisation of Australia, and how they “never respected us as human beings when they opened fire and took everything”.

He said people at home were keen to learn about their roots and the shield was a major symbol of the past that could help teach them.

“They’re all just asking me ‘When are they coming back? Can you bring them back yet?’”

But he said the British Museum Act is one of the reasons why the institute is refusing to return the shield.

A report by Sarah Keenan, senior professor at Birkbeck Law School, claims the British Museum “changed its story” about the origins of the Gweagal Shield when a two-day workshop to “test the argument the shield was collected at Botany bay in 1770” led participants to argue it is not from Cook’s landing.

Mr Kelly said repatriation was important in light of “all the stuff that’s happened in the past” and it would be a “huge moment in time to have the British Museum and others actually return things to the Aboriginal people because it would be a great step towards the healing process.”

He added ancestral spears taken by Cook and his men at the same time were held at the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Cambridge; he also viewed those privately last year.

Mr Kelly’s claim to the artefacts has been backed by a motion passed in 2016 by New South Wales’ parliament, which acknowledged his clan as the shield’s rightful owners; Australia’s Senate followed suit two months later.

Australian historian Keith Vincent Smith told The Independent: “I can certainly say the Gweagal at Botany Bay are the rightful owners of the shield and spears taken from there by Joseph Banks and James Cook in 1770.”

In a paper entitled Confronting Cook, Mr Smith describes how information about Cooman was passed down through generations, after an Aboriginal woman’s account of what happened was documented in the 1840s.

He said the shield is likely to be the same as the one seen in drawings from the time.

Mr Kelly, who is visiting the UK for the fourth time in collaboration with pressure group BP Or Not BP? said he was amazed at what was on display at the British Museum.

During last year’s visit he said he took part in the group’s ‘British Museum Stolen Goods Tour’ to protest a controversial BP-sponsored exhibition of Iraqi artefacts. This week, he leads the group’s ‘British Museum Stolen Goods Tour: Colonialism, Carbon & Cook” with speakers discussing “looted items” on display from Iraq, Palestine, Greece and Australia.

He said: “For me, this tour is all about getting different cultures together because we’re all in it for that one cause. I think it’s a great opportunity for us to unite and to show the British People and British Museum there’s a real need for these items to be repatriated and we can make the world a better place if we did.”

He said Aboriginal items living in museums made it “harder to have a connection to the past”.

BP Or Not BP’s Danny Chivers said the opportunity for Mr Kelly to privately view his ancestral shield was a positive step.

He said: “It shows on some level they must accept the legitimacy of his request, even if they haven’t shown any signs of returning it.”

But Mr Kelly said museums need to start thinking about new ways of “making their collections legitimate.”

He added: “As long as there’s stuff that’s been wrongfully taken, there’s always going to be someone like myself looking for ways to get their culture back so we can teach our kids about our history, and about where we come from.”

The British Museum was asked if it believed in the legitimacy of claims by historians and ancestral records that the shield belongs to the Gweagal clan but it did not provide a specific response.

A spokesperson at the Museum said “colleagues were delighted to welcome Rodney” and that the institute had “repeated the offer on Tuesday, that we would be very happy to discuss a loan of the shield” as it had done to the National Museum of Australia in 2016.

She added: “It was a very positive visit, with suggestions for future collaborations to understand and interpret both the shield and other objects more fully. The Museum looks forward to continuing these discussions.”",Aboriginal man demands British Museum return 18th century shield stolen from his ancestor,"arts, culture, entertainment and media",culture,997

As talks to end the war in Afghanistan continue in Qatar this week, and amid continued political disarray in Kabul, there seems to be one clear trend on the ground: The Taliban are consolidating control. The longer the war drags on—now in its 18th year—the more the balance of the conflict tips in the insurgent group’s favor. While there has been fierce debate in the West and in government-controlled areas of Afghanistan about what peace talks with the Taliban mean for women’s rights and the future of Afghan democracy, the view from Taliban-controlled areas suggests a harsh reality that few in the international community seem prepared for: If peace talks succeed, the Taliban will effectively formalize, and likely expand, their control over vast swaths of the country. If peace talks fail, however, the outcome will likely be far worse, with renewed fighting and a precarious government in Kabul.

The Taliban have spent years preparing for a return to power. In areas currently under their control, the insurgency has replaced the Afghan government with their own administration, including sharia courts and a force of shadow civil servants responsible for an array of tasks from monitoring teacher attendance to collecting taxes.

Most Afghans in these areas, which have borne the brunt of the conflict, simply want the fighting to end. They assume that under any U.S.-brokered deal, Taliban control will simply become permanent. And they have strikingly modest hopes for peace: “Once they don’t have to fight anymore, maybe the Taliban will be less strict,” one woman in the eastern province of Logar said. “Maybe they will let girls go back to school.”

If hope is in short supply, it is in part because hopes have been dashed too many times. In June 2018, a three-day cease-fire declared by the Taliban, the Afghan government, and international forces was the first official pause in the 18-year war. It was a remarkable turn of events that few could have predicted. Pictures of Taliban, government forces, and civilians celebrating the Eid holiday together flooded social media. There was little violence and no civilian casualties. Afghans gained a glimpse of what peace might look like and a sense that an end to the war might finally be in sight.

It wasn’t to be. Fighting resumed almost immediately after the cease-fire and has not let up since. The wife of a Taliban fighter described the cease-fire as a cruel trick that created hope only to snatch it away. When I asked about the prospect of peace talks, she waved her hand dismissively. Like many others, she believed that the war would only end if U.S. forces withdrew.

Nonetheless, recent progress made in political talks would have seemed unthinkably optimistic even a year ago. The United States reversed its refusal to talk directly to the Taliban and appointed Zalmay Khalilzad as special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation in September 2018. Khalilzad and Taliban representatives have since engaged in several rounds of negotiations. In January, Khalilzad announced that the United States and the Taliban had broadly agreed on a draft document outlining a withdrawal of U.S. troops and guarantees from the Taliban that they will not harbor or support foreign terrorist organizations. Before it can be finalized, however, the United States has insisted that the Taliban agree to talk directly to the Afghan government and declare another cease-fire. The Taliban have steadfastly refused—they don’t even recognize the government in Kabul.

As talks continued, Washington ramped up airstrikes as well as searches and raids targeting the Taliban. These operations are no longer geared toward reasserting Afghan government control or preventing the Taliban from gaining further ground. The objective is instead to pressure the Taliban into making concessions, such as talking directly to the Afghan government. No one knows any longer how much territory might be under Taliban influence or control. Operation Resolute Support, the NATO mission to advise, train, and support Afghan forces, stopped measuring this in October 2018. Instead, the military focus seems to be on increasing on Taliban body counts. The consequences for civilians have been disastrous. Civilian casualties from airstrikes reached record highs in 2018. In May, the United Nations announced that, for the first time since it started systematically monitoring civilian casualties, international and Afghan government forces are responsible for more civilian deaths than the insurgents.

While this increased military pressure might keep the Taliban at bay, there’s little indication it has dented their resolve. Instead, they present the cease-fire and talks with the United States as a sign of their political and military strength.

“Americans said this group is not united, it is fragmented,” a senior member of the Taliban leadership told me in Dubai last January. “The bottom line is that we did this to prove to the world we are under one command, and everyone should respect this command.”

To fighters on the ground, peace talks are an acknowledgment of the Taliban’s growing power. The fighters I interviewed were resolute: They would not lay down arms until the United States withdrew and what they considered to be a true Islamic government could be established. They uniformly insisted that of course they wanted peace—but on their terms. The Taliban focus is now on waiting out U.S. resolve.

Taliban foot soldiers see no point in talks with the Afghan government. “If the United States stops their support to the government for even a month, we would be able to take all of Afghanistan,” a Taliban commander in Helmand said. “That’s why we have to reach an agreement with Washington.”

Despite refusing to formally engage with the Afghan government, Taliban leaders have indicated that they are open to sharing power with other factions. They have also said that they want an inclusive postwar government. At a conference held in Moscow in February with former President Hamid Karzai and other Afghan power brokers in attendance, the Taliban leadership called for “the establishment of an inclusive independent Islamic System that is acceptable to Afghans and reflects Islamic and Afghan values.”

The degree to which the Taliban’s overtures are genuine is unclear. Fighters on the ground generally assume that they will retain control of their areas—and assert full control in currently contested areas—under any peace deal. The fate of major cities and regions that have resisted Taliban influence was left undefined. What power-sharing seems to mean to these fighters is that the Taliban are willing to allow others to participate in their future government. Fighters hoped that this government would enforce the Taliban’s brand of sharia and conservative social practices that deeply constrain women’s rights and freedoms. If the Taliban were to take power in this way, the best outcome that can be reasonably hoped for is that they will form a less incompetent and more lenient government than they did in the 1990s.

Talks with the Afghan government seem a long way off, however, and for reasons that have nothing to do with the Taliban’s intransigence. The National Unity Government is increasingly divided, with Afghan political factions gearing up for presidential elections scheduled for Sept. 28. A peace jirga, or political gathering, convened by the government last month yielded little consensus and seemed to be more about electoral politics than ending the war. Several major political factions boycotted the jirga, claiming it was a political trick designed to bolster President Ashraf Ghani’s reelection prospects.

The possibility of credible elections is remote. Presidential elections, originally set for April 20, have been twice delayed. Provincial and district council elections, also initially scheduled for September, have been indefinitely postponed. In parliamentary elections held last October, at least one-third of polling stations could not open due to insecurity, and the results were so contested that they took six months to announce. Afghanistan’s last two presidential elections, in 2009 and 2014, were widely fraudulent, and the results were disputed. In the 2014 elections, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry intervened to broker a power-sharing agreement that would prevent the government from unraveling. To expect a conclusive result in the next round of voting would be deeply unrealistic.

Even the best potential outcome is likely to be a deeply unpalatable one. If peace talks actually succeed, the Taliban will exert considerable power, if not outright control, in any future government. The consequences for Afghans, particularly women, in areas currently held by the government are likely to be severe. Donors in Kabul have consistently articulated support for peace efforts. Whether they would continue to support such a government is another question altogether. The alternatives, however, may be even worse: a continued escalation in violence or all-out civil war.

“The fighters on the front line on both sides can make peace easily,” a fighter in Helmand argued. “If we left it up to them the war would be settled, but, like every war, it is not the fighters who decide.”

For better or worse, the fate of Afghanistan is up to political leaders in Washington, Kabul, and Doha to decide. As the current round of talks—the seventh such attempt—continues in Qatar, the United States is eager to finalize a deal to end its involvement in the war. U.S. military and State department officials said privately that they were working with a “tweet of Damocles” hanging over their heads, fearing that U.S. President Donald Trump will spontaneously issue a tweet withdrawing troops from Afghanistan as he did with Syria in December 2018. The Afghan government is increasingly consumed by infighting and electoral politics. And the Taliban are running out the clock, betting that their refusal to talk to the Afghan government will allow them to strengthen their negotiating hand and their territorial control. At present, none of these actors appear ready, or able, to make the sacrifices required to end the war.",There Will Be No Peace for Afghanistan,"conflict, war and peace",peace process,1613
971378,thesun,"PERSONAL trainers shared the strangest things their clients ask them to do — including naked workouts and oiled up wrestling.

Over 2,000 fitness experts were asked about the weirdest requests they've got as part of their job, which frequently included having sex with the client.

Online local services marketplace Bark.com compiled the bizarre results of the survey of personal trainers' experiences.

Trainers were asked if they'd ever experienced any inappropriate behaviour while on the job, as well as if the people they worked with had strange fitness goals.

They were also quizzed about if they'd ever had requests to hold training sessions in strange locations.

It turned out one of the trainers in the survey had been asked to hold a client's face during their workout.

And another said they'd been approached by a man who wanted to have exercise sessions ""in his bedroom"".

One respondent even said their client and stripped naked in front of them before a session.

Others had been smacked on the bottom and been told the intimate details of an affair one of their clients was having.

Speaking about the survey, Kai Feller, Bark.com co-founder, said: ""There's no doubt personal trainers see the best and worst in people when putting them through their paces, but after hearing from our fitness experts, it sounds like tired and time-poor clients are the least of their worries.""

109301,cnsnews,"(CNSNews.com) - Vice President Mike Pence, defending both his wife and his Christian faith, spoke Thursday about the liberal backlash resulting from Karen Pence's decision to return to a Christian school as a volunteer art teacher.

 

 ""To see the mainstream media...criticize my wife because she's choosing to return to the classroom of an elementary Christian school is wrong,"" Pence told ""Washington Watch.""

 

 CatholicVote.org gathered some of the offensive comments and headlines from ""anti-Christian bigots"" in the ""left-wing media,"" as follows:

 

 -- “Karen Pence’s Bigoted New School"" (Huffington Post)

 

 -- CNN reporter Kate Bennett tweeted: ""So let me get this straight, the second lady of the United States has chosen to work at a school that openly discriminates against LGBT adults and children.”

 

 -- Lois Romano, The Washington Post: “How can this happen in America in 2019?”

My wife and I have been in the public eye for quite a while. We're used to the criticism. But I have to tell you, to see major news organizations attacking Christian education is deeply offensive to us.

 

 We have a rich tradition in America of Christian education, and frankly, religious education broadly defined. We celebrate it. The freedom of religion is enshrined in the Constitution of the United States. The Constitution prohibits a religious test for holding public office. We'll let the other critics roll off our back, but this criticism of religious education in America should stop.

Immanuel Christian school, located in Northern Virginia, says on its website: ""We are, first of all, a Christian school and as such establish the biblical basis from which we will teach a Christian world and life view. While we recognize that not all parents will agree with every item in this statement, it is necessary that the parents agree to support the premise that their child will be taught from the perspective provided in our statement of belief.""

 

 What outraged some on the left is the school's policy against ""moral misconduct,"" which includes ""heterosexual activity outside of marriage (e.g., premarital sex, cohabitation, extramarital sex), homosexual or lesbian sexual activity, polygamy, transgender identity, any other violation of the unique roles of male and female, sexual harassment, use or viewing of pornographic material or websites.”

 

 The Huffington Post reported on Thursday that an LGBTQ advocacy group ""has sent Immanuel Christian 100 copies of A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo, a children’s book about a boy bunny who falls in love with another boy bunny. Included with the books is 'a heartfelt note that encourages the school’s leaders to accept LGBTQ young people,' the group said.""

 

 In an essay on Thursday, the Family Research Council's Tony Perkins said the fury directed at Karen Pence for simply volunteering at a Christian school should serve as a warning for all Christians:

 

 Three years after the Supreme Court made same-sex marriage legal, Perkins wrote, ""all of the lies about 'love' and 'tolerance' have been eclipsed by the court cases, articles, and editorials demonizing people of faith. What Americans see now is the truth: the Left is coming for our freedom. And they have no intention of letting up,"" he continued:

Like Joe Biden's wife, Karen Pence spent years in the classroom. When Mike was in Congress, she taught art at Immanuel Christian School in Virginia -- and no one batted an eye. Of course, that was back in the early 2000s, when the Left's charm offensive on same-sex marriage was still in full swing. We'll be accommodating, they said. We just want to co-exist, they said. Our relationships won't affect you, they said. A handful of years later, ""affected"" doesn't begin to describe to what happens to conservatives who think differently than the totalitarian Left.

 

 Of course, the Pences are not strangers to the other side's viciousness. Every time the media is reminded about the family's faith, they become hysterical all over again -- a scene that played out this week when Karen announced she'd be volunteering at Immanuel Christian this spring. ""I am excited to be back in the classroom and doing what I love to do,"" she said in a statement. ""I have missed teaching art, and it's great to return to the school where I taught art for 12 years.""

 

 She can't go back there, LGBT activists raged! They reject homosexuality! Yes, well, that's what orthodox Christian schools do. (Not to mention Jewish and Muslim ones too.) Would it have been headline news if Jill Biden taught at a Roman Catholic school? Probably not. Yet, the Left and their media chums are hurling profanity at the Pences for something that, even five years ago, wouldn't have been controversial. Frankly, the only thing that would have been shocking is if Karen worked at a Christian school that didn't act like a Christian school.

Perkins said the left's ""real problem"" isn't that Karen Pence is working at a Christian school; the real problem is that evangelical schools exist at all.

 

 ""There used to be a consensus in this country that religious liberty was for everyone. When the Religious Freedom Restoration Act came before Congress, only three members voted against it. Over time, some liberals tried to isolate faith -- to churches, Christian schools, or family rooms. You've heard me say before that the Left's hope is to quarantine religion within the four walls of the church. Now, it's becoming clear -- even that won't satisfy them.""",Pence: 'To See Major News Organizations Attacking Christian Education Is Deeply Offensive To Us',education,religious education,907
80069,buzzfeed,"Sen. Kamala Harris and Rep. Pramila Jayapal are leading a group of Democrats in Congress to introduce a bill giving domestic workers protections against sexual harassment and racial discrimination, which many currently don’t have because they’re excluded under civil rights laws.

The bill, which legislators plan to introduce in the House and Senate on Monday, is unlikely to clear the Republican-controlled Senate and be signed into law by the president, even if Democrats pass it in the House.

The National Domestic Workers Alliance, which represents housekeepers, home health aides, and nannies from across the country, was involved in crafting the new bill and nine other similar state-level bills in recent years.

“This bill is a moral anchor for us in a time of national political strife,” Ai-jen Poo, director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, said at a press conference in Washington, DC.

Poo said the bill aims to correct loopholes in the Civil Rights Act, the Occupational Health and Safety Act, and the National Labor Relations Act, which don’t currently require employers with fewer than 15 workers to abide by anti-discrimination and workplace health and safety laws.

The measure includes a plan to set up a federal wages and standards board modeled on the boards in Seattle, New York, and California, training programs for industry groups, and a task force to focus on the issue run by the departments of Labor and Health and Human Services and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. It would also provide a minimum wage and overtime pay for domestic workers.

“For a long time we have been experiencing inequality, wage theft, verbal abuse, physical abuse,” said June Barrett, a Miami-based organizer with NWDA who worked as a home health care aide for 16 years and said she was sexually harassed several times. “I think domestic workers have been excluded from the labor laws because they don’t see it as real work.”",Democrats Are Pushing A Bill To Give Domestic Workers Employee Protections,labour,employment legislation,311
698616,theguardianuk,"Barriers and advertising banners are being erected around fields in the tulip bulb region of the Netherlands in an attempt to deter a growing number of tourists from flattening the flowers to take selfies.

Tourists have been seen jumping above the tulips to secure the perfect picture, or lying down in the middle of fields, squashing the bulbs.

Simon Pennings, a grower near the town of Noordwijkerhout in the bulb region of south-west Netherlands, was the first to erect a barrier in his field, emblazoned with the slogan of a pilot campaign backed by the local tourist board: “Enjoy the flowers, respect our pride.”

“They are so careless,” Pennings said of the tourists. “We get large groups of people visiting, which we find very nice and fun, but they flatten everything. It is a shame and we suffer damage as a result. Last year, I had a plot with €10,000 [£8,700] in damage. Everything was trampled … They want to take that selfie anyway.”

Nicole van Lieshout from the local tourist office said a group of 40 “ambassadors” – a voluntary team of guides, including retired farmers – will seek to teach visitors about the history of the tulip fields.

“In recent years, the number of tourists coming has been higher and higher,” said Van Lieshout. “I think the tourists think the fields were made for them. Everyone wants the perfect selfie and the pictures go all over the world, lying or dancing among the flowers.

“We don’t want to send the tourists away. The farmers make the fields beautiful for the visitors, but pictures need to be taken on the edge of the fields, not in or on the flowers.”

Pennings told the Dutch newspaper the Algemeen Dagblad people were generally respectful when they were educated about the fields.

“They don’t think about it,” he said. “People have lost sight of how a plant grows and that we are working on it all year round. When I explain that to people in the field, they say, ‘Oh, oh, yes, you’re right’, and ‘I’m sorry I didn’t see it at all and didn’t understand it’.

“It’s largely ignorance. I assume that. Milk also comes from a factory and not from a cow. That is also the case with the bulbs. It is thought that it is a kind of plastic.”

The Dutch tourism board has made a “dos and don’ts” guide to taking a selfie near a tulip field.

Van Lieshout said growers’ difficulty in dealing with the interest in tulips had been highlighted over the weekend when the roads into the Keukenhof, a 32-hectare (79 acre) floral garden where growers showcase their latest flowers, became gridlocked. Drivers had spilled out of their cars and into the fields.

The annual number of visitors to the Keukenhof has risen from 800,000 to 1.4 million in the past six years. The garden’s director, Bart Siemerink, described the situation as “unacceptable for residents and entrepreneurs in the bulb region”.

The curse of the selfie-taking tourist is not a new phenomenon. Last summer, the New York Times reported on the case of the Bogle family, who had opened their farm in Ontario to allow visitors to wander past tall sunflowers. After eight days, the family shut the gates, blaming hordes of amateur photographers who trampled on plants in order to secure the best selfie, plucked sunflower heads to use as props and left rubbish strewn across the farm.",Dutch fence off tulip fields to stop selfie-takers crushing flowers,human interest,plant,561
5227,activistpost,"Gone are the days when cities used streetlamps to simply illuminate sidewalks and streets. Today’s streetlamps are being used to form an inter-connected web of surveillance devices.

A recent San Diego Union-Tribune article revealed how San Diego police officers have used streetlamp video surveillance in at least 140 cases and sometimes as frequently as 20 times a month.

Let that sink in for a moment; spying streetlamps are real and police have already requested video footage from more than 140 streetlamps.

Lt. Jeffery Jordon called spying streetlamps “game changing” and that is exactly how they should be viewed. Streetlamps that are designed to spy on the public, really is a game changer.

San Diego’s streetlamps are also equipped with ShotSpotter microphones that police claim are not being used to listen to public conversations.

Should we believe them?

Could police use ShotSpotter to listen to public conversations? Nearly a decade ago, the East Bay Times revealed how the Oakland Police used ShotSpotter to record public conversations.

It was only three years ago when the NJ Transit secretly used DriveCam’s LTYX cameras equipped with microphones to listen to public conversations.

So just what is law enforcement using these streetlamps for?

No one knows for sure; but a spokesperson for San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer said that a citywide policy to regulate the use of the microphones and cameras in streetlamps is “under development.”

The San Diego Union-Tribune claims that 100 police officers have direct access to streetlamp surveillance and said that nearly every one of the department’s 1,800 police officers can request access.

Just how concerned is the City Council that law enforcement is using streetlamps as surveillance devices?

Apparently not very much, as City Councilwoman Monica Montgomery admitted, by saying that she’s “open to exploring” oversight of the program.

In what dystopian nightmare are we living in, where listening and watching everything we do in public is “under development” or “open to oversight”?

Over the past few years, I have written numerous stories about smart streetlamp/streetlight surveillance.

Police are also using streetlamps equipped with things like Smart Nodes and secret facial recognition cameras to identify Bluetooth devices and people. More recently, I warned everyone that law enforcement is using GE’s CityIQ street lights and Intellistreets to identify people. (Click here to learn more about SKYEYE streetlamps.)

But this story is far more disturbing than those because as the San Diego Union-Tribune points out, politicians and police think nothing of using streetlamps to track people in real-time.

574669,tass,"""Everything that is connected with a doping scandal reminds me already of an endless anti-Russian soap opera as they have made a decision, introduced punishments and declared suspensions,"" Medvedev said.

MOSCOW, December 5. /TASS/. Continuous doping abuse accusations of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) against Russian sports look like an ‘endless anti-Russian soap opera,’ Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said in an interview with Russian television channels on Thursday.

""A bit later, something itched again and they decided — let’s look once again at the very same lists, reanalyze the very same samples to see if we have missed something and we will punish again those, who have been already punished, and in some cases we will also expand the responsibility on other athletes, regardless of their innocence,"" the Russian prime minister stated.

Medvedev also said that a decision of the World Anti-Doping Agency on possible sanctions regarding Russian sports ""will be very tough for our country.""

The Russian prime minister added that a problem of consumption of banned performance enhancing drugs in Russia exists but this situation is unacceptable in sports.

""Is there a doping problem here [in Russia]? Yes, there is,"" Medvedev said in an interview with Russian television channels on Thursday.

540786,sputnik,"In order to bolster the confidence of Chinese researchers to participate in the peer-review process for international journals, China Academy of Social Sciences Evaluation Studies (CASSES) organized a Beijing-based training workshop for Chinese researchers on Friday together with International academic publisher Taylor & Francis Group.

""I don't think 'IEEE cases' will stop. It may happen again, probably with another institution in the near future… In the context of global competition, it is inevitable that China's academia will get a raw deal, even vicious encirclement and suppression, if it wants to have a say and occupy a particular position on the global stage,"" Jing Linbo, dean of CASSES, told the Global Times.

According to the latest data from China's National Bureau of Statistics, the number of research papers by Chinese included in the Science Citation Index (SCI), Engineering Index (EI) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI) reached 418,000, 266,000 and 59,000 respectively. The Essential Science Indicators database shows that Chinese research papers ranked at No.2 on the list of the highest cited publications for 2018.

This achievement is closely tied to strong financial support from the government. In 2018, China spent 1.97 trillion yuan ($278.8 billion) on R&D - 138 times than the amount in 1991, putting it right behind the US.

In many ways, Chinese researchers are working hard to have their voices heard, including as peer reviewers.

""We were delighted to be able to partner with CASSES to offer training in how to be a peer reviewer for international academic journals. It has been shown by a number of studies that, although Chinese researchers are contributing to global research at a high level as authors, they currently represent a relatively low proportion of peer reviewers. Through this training, we are aiming to ensure more Chinese researchers are equipped to be peer reviewers for Taylor & Francis and Routledge journals, which is vital for global representation at every stage of the peer review process,""said Diana Marshall, head of reviewer programs at the Taylor & Francis Group.

One 25-year-old graduate student studying at a second-tier Chinese university talked to the Global Times about the challenges Chinese researchers face when it comes to the peer review system. Working on research 12 hours a day, six days a week, the student, who wished to remain anonymous, has been waiting for a reply to an article on mineral engineering he sent to a top SCI journal.

If his article is published, he will become a stronger candidate for his dream doctoral program at an Australian university.

He acknowledged that the language barrier is a great hindrance. Many Chinese students and researchers like him have to spend time and energy on reading English articles and improving their academic writing in English.

He told the Global Times that when it comes to mineral engineering research, China takes the lead globally. He noted that, for this reason, some Chinese researchers in the field would rather publish articles in domestic journals instead of foreign ones.

However, in China, promotions for researchers are closely related to the number of articles published on top international academic journals; it is also a key proof of one's scientific achievements. This pressure has brought about corruption and academic misconduct.

At the end of July, the misconduct of a female researcher in Shanghai was revealed on social media. The young researcher was able to get her name fraudulently added to five SCI published articles because she had a relationship with the author.

Jing said these issues stem from the problematic evaluation of academic journals.

""China's academia now has a misconception: As long as the impact factor of a journal is high, it must be a top journal,"" Jing said.

Impact factors are used to measure the importance of a journal by calculating the yearly average number of times selected articles are cited within the last few years.

Under these circumstances, Chinese researchers will choose to publish their new breakthroughs abroad first, instead of domestic journals, especially in natural science.

""We should now reflect on our evaluation system. Fortunately, we've seen systematic progress. I know in the field of natural science, doctoral students are required to publish two to three SCI articles and another Chinese article,"" Jing noted.

CASSES has made another step forward to improve this situation by establishing its own evaluation model for humanities and social science journals. The model is called AMI, which stands for attraction, management power and impact power.

Attraction, refers to a journal's awards, quality and peer review results. Management power covers any academic misconduct and adherence to institutional norms by the journal. Impact power refers to a journal's academic, social and international influence.

In Jing's opinion, this creates a multi-dimensional quantitative and qualitative evaluation system that can help evaluate academic journals and think tanks.

The Centre for Science and Technology Studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands and the Norway-based Nordic Institute for Studies in Innovation, Research and Education have shown great interest in the system, according to Jing, who is ready to promote China's evaluation system in Europe.

One of the purposes of the workshop is to familiarize Chinese researchers with the global peer review process and accelerating their entrance to global academia.

In the West, articles fall under the scrutiny of two to three often-anonymous experts in the same field to make sure the final work meets publishing requirements.

At Taylor & Francis, an associate editor finds two reviewers on the web using science and reviewer finder tools.

Jing told the Global Times that peer reviewers in the West usually work for free and only for a few times a year. By comparison, Chinese peer reviewers may be asked to review papers multiple times in a year, and hence are paid.

He said that a high number of peer reviewers can benefit a country in two ways: giving it more power to vote on international standards and putting it in a leading position of academic power.

""The more papers you publish and the more members in an institute, the higher your academic position. Talents decide a country's competitiveness,"" Jing said.

Regarding carrying out peer review for international journals, Marshall encourages Chinese researchers increase their profile with editors as much as possible.

""My suggestion is to get known by the journals,"" she advised.

Sienho Yee, editor-in-chief of the Chinese Journal of International Law, told the Global Times that the key to improving Chinese researchers' profile is to carry out high-quality research.

""An entire paragraph of my work was once quoted by a judge at the International Court of Justice, because my research and analysis could support the judge, not because I am Chinese,"" Yee said.

Jing echoed Yee, noting that a major challenge is that many Chinese academics lack the ability to explain or summarize China's achievements in different fields.

""Most people wear a pair of tinted spectacles to look at Chinese issues,"" Jing said.

""If we Chinese don't take the initiative to introduce our country, how can foreigners? No wonder their understanding is so one-sided.""

Jing said that open and fair international exchanges in academic fields should continue even though the US is wary of Chinese researchers.

""It is obvious [US President Donald] Trump's policy [to suspect Chinese researchers] is not sustainable. The US is a country of immigrants. If the US does not open its doors, it will fade at a faster speed,"" Jing told the Global Times.

He encouraged Chinese researchers to make their voices heard among international academia and visit the US for academic exchanges, as ""the US is the highland of global scientific research.""

The mineral engineering graduate student is also looking forward to more Chinese voices being heard and Chinese researchers helping connect China and the world.

130508,dailyheraldchicago,"Lynn Pittner's favorite technique for teaching math begins with two simple questions: ""What do we notice? What do we wonder?""

What do we notice about the number of animals at the zoo, or the amount of candy dispensed from a machine when we feed it a quarter? What do we wonder about the cost or the ingredients or the process of making a chocolate sucker?

The students shout out their observations and make some estimates. And then they set about finding their own solutions to the problem at hand, using whichever strategies work best for them: place values, the arrow way, an open number line, the chip model.

""There's a lot of individuality because all children are on a continuum,"" said Pittner, who is in her sixth year as a math specialist at Davis Primary School in St. Charles.

""They learn a lot, they have fun, and they're applying what they've learned in class to a real-life situation.""

The activities, called math tasks, have been crucial in helping her kindergartners through second-graders become ""flexible thinkers"" and develop a conceptual understanding of math early on, she said.

But parents, colleagues and administrators say Pittner's teaching methods -- not to mention her love and enthusiasm for the subject -- ignite a passion in them, too.

That's a key reason why Pittner is leaving ""enormous shoes to fill"" when she retires at the end of this academic year, first-grade teacher Rachel McCulloch said.

""She brings new life and has just revitalized math in this whole building as something that we want to teach,"" she said. ""The kids have changed the way they think about math, too. They're not scared of it like they used to be. She really did make an enormous shift.""

Throughout Pittner's robust career, whatever grade level she's teaching at the time becomes her new favorite.

First, it was sixth grade in downstate Rantoul before she took some time off to raise her children. Then, when she became an educator for the academically talented math program in St. Charles Unit District 303, she became enthralled by the intelligence and energy of her intermediate-level students.

After getting her master's degree in math education, Pittner's next move was teaching eighth grade -- a fascinating time in students' lives, she said, because ""they're children but want to be adults. And they have a great sense of humor.""

Her husband's job eventually moved them out to California, where she continued teaching middle school math. But after about six years, she said, she felt ready to return home to Illinois.

Amid those discussions, a close friend asked, ""If you had your dream, what would you do next in your career?""

Pittner wanted to go back to the beginning.

In the same way children learn to read, she wanted to experience how they begin to understand numbers. She wanted to become a math coach of sorts for early elementary students, to help them develop number sense.

Not that a job like that existed, she and her friend said, laughing. Not for children that young.

Six months later, by sheer coincidence, Pittner learned of a new position District 303 would be trying out in three schools: a math specialist. She applied and got the job at Davis, which offers only kindergarten through second grade.

Guess which age group she fell in love with next?

""I absolutely love these little ones that come to school ready and willing to learn,"" she said. ""Their enthusiasm for learning is unbelievable.""

Being a primary school, Davis staff members have always focused heavily on literacy, a subject with which they're very comfortable, Principal Denise Liechty said. Then, about five years ago, Pittner came into the picture with a contagious zeal for math and a depth of knowledge that allowed her to build foundational skills for both students and educators.

""Now my teachers are equally excited about math,"" Liechty said.

When she started her new position, Pittner sensed that teachers in the building were ""hungry for a change."" Eager to collaborate, they embraced every new method she introduced, she said, and they even took summer classes with her to strengthen their techniques.

Eventually, Pittner's role morphed into an ever-changing mix of classroom visits and small group sessions and faculty meetings, all while acting as a resource to the teachers. The math specialist positions are now in all schools, she added.

""We were just trying to make a shift in the pedagogy of teachers in the classrooms,"" Pittner said. ""I think we were all pleasantly surprised that when children are given a big math problem that requires them to apply their learning, they're extremely motivated.""

Getting the parents on board can make all the difference.

The methods taught at Davis offer an entirely new way of learning math, compared to the standard algorithm taught to most adults, she said. ""We all learned math without context.""

To help parents better understand the curriculum, Pittner provides demonstrations at parent-teacher conferences, sends home activities for students during breaks, and works with other specialists in the district to host math nights.

After one adult math lesson with Pittner, parent Sarah Mowat said, she and her husband walked away feeling like experts.

""She's magical ... and very good at boosting confidence,"" said Mowat, whose two daughters attend Davis. ""I don't think I realized until I was the parent of a kindergartner what a difference a teacher can make in their lives.""

Years ago, while teaching academically talented math at Wild Rose Elementary, Pittner walked into the classroom one day holding a chocolate sucker.

""I want to make these and sell them,"" she told her students, initiating a round of questioning similar to ""What do we notice? What do we wonder?""

After figuring out how many suckers they could make with a half-pound of chocolate -- and at what cost -- the kids asked if they could turn their lesson into a real business. They gathered at Pittner's house on a Saturday afternoon and made 500 suckers, which they sold to their classmates after settling on a price.

That real-life math problem was recounted years later as a former student's ""fondest memory"" of the advanced math program. A Benet Academy student at the time with plans to study aerospace engineering at Purdue University, he sent a letter thanking Pittner for the ""very positive impact"" she had on his life.

""You gave me my love for math and science that has led me to pursue a career that involves the two,"" the student's letter says. ""You created and fostered my passion for numbers that continues to grow today.""

That level of enthusiasm and rigor remains ingrained in Pittner's teaching style, colleagues say, as does her compassion and ability to build relationships.

Almost every morning at 7 a.m., Pittner pops into the principal's office and says, ""Got a minute?"" before diving into the details of a new math concept she wants to try, or celebrating a great piece of student work, or applauding a teacher's strategy.

""She's one that can see the math in anything and will find the oddest of tools and circumstances to utilize for getting kids engaged in math,"" Liechty said. ""She always sees what they can do, and then catapults her instruction so they are taking it to the next level.""

Pittner is an advocate for students, a cheerleader for teachers and a ""ray of sunshine in our building,"" kindergarten teacher Megan Oster says. She'll work patiently and productively with kids and staff members alike for as long as it takes to solve a problem.

And, most importantly, she makes members of the Davis community believe in their abilities.

""In our building, we don't just do math,"" Pittner says. ""We're mathematicians.""

Education: Bachelor's degree in education from Illinois State University; master's degree in math education from National-Louis University

Past teaching jobs: Seventh-grade math teacher at Central Middle School, Riverside, California; eighth-grade math teacher at Haines Middle School, St. Charles; academically talented math coordinator for District 303; academically talented math teacher for District 303; sixth-grade teacher at Maplewood School, Rantoul

Other experience: Co-authored ""Understanding Middle School Math"" with Arthur Hyde, Susan Friedlaner and Cheryl Heck; previously provided professional development for Heinemann Publishing

When it comes to teaching math, Lynn Pittner has plenty of methods for helping young children develop a conceptual understanding of the subject. As a math specialist at Davis Primary School in St. Charles for more than five years, she has spread her passion and enthusiasm for math throughout the building, colleagues say.

But there's far more to being a great teacher than having a wealth of knowledge. Here are some words of advice Pittner offers to other teachers:
• Build relationships with your students. Love each and every one.
• Make sure your students know you care.
• Have high expectations for your students. ALL students will succeed.
• Never do for students what they can do for themselves. Support them, but productive struggle is important for learning.
• Be passionate about learning. Be a lifelong learner.",How a St. Charles teacher is instilling love for math in young students,science and technology,mathematics,1471
6200,activistpost,"With zero signs of abating, hundreds of thousands of pro-democracy protesters lined the streets around Hong Kong’s financial and shopping districts on Sunday, demanding the Beijing-backed Hong Kong government fulfill their demands, reported Reuters.

The semi-peaceful protest, a drastic change from violent ones in the last several weeks that have been raging for at least six months, plunged the city into a dangerous recession in Nov., attracted at least 800,000 participants on Sunday, according to protest organizer Civil Human Rights Front. Though Hong Kong police said that approximately 200,000 showed up.

Reuters quoted protest chants as some said, “Fight for freedom! Stand with Hong Kong!,” while they marched across Victoria Park in the city’s shopping district and financial area.

A protester, by the name of Lawrence,23, told Reuters that, “It’s Christmas time soon, but we’re not in the mood to celebrate anymore.”

The Wall Street Journal spoke with Johnny Tung, 41, who joined the march with his two sons. He said, “as a Hong Konger, it’s my duty to be here today. Our people have tried protesting peacefully, we’ve done it more violently, but again and again, we’ve been ignored. I just want the government to please just respond to the people so society can return to peace.”

China has become more vocal about Western powers interfering in the Hong Kong protests since the US signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act HKHRDA) into law last month. This allows Washington to impose sanctions against Chinese and Hong Kong leaders responsible for human rights violations during the protests.

Beijing was furious when the US lawmakers passed HKHRDA, which they have vowed to retaliate with a no-entry list for US lawmakers behind drafting the bill, along with other government officials, though the true extent of the retaliation remains a mystery.

On Saturday, we noted that the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong was detained and then denied access to the neighboring Chinese city of Macau.

Protesters on Sunday had five demands for the unpopular Beijing-backed Carrie Lam government. Some of the requests include a complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process, release and pardon of arrested protesters, and resignation of Lam.

Thousands on social media accounts documented the massive march with tons of video showing hundreds of thousands of protesters walking the streets.

The latest acceleration in social-economic turmoil in Hong Kong suggests that more unrest is coming for 1Q20. If China starts losing control of the city, then Beijing could be inclined to deploy PLA troops. It seems that this worst-case scenario might be realized sometime in 2020 if the escalation continues.

The question everyone is asking: With the Hong Kong bill passed into law — when do US lawmakers start sanctioning China and Hong Kong leaders over human rights violations?

21246,bbc,"A man convicted of killing his wife is now believed to have murdered his defence lawyer, with whom he had been having an affair, before taking his own life on Friday.

Jose Javier Salvador Calvo, 50, jumped from a bridge in the eastern town of Teruel when police confronted him.

The case has shocked Spain, prompting debate about domestic violence laws.

Reacting to the deaths, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez vowed to continue tackling violence against women.

His tweet is seen as a retort to Vox, a far-right party influential in the southern region of Andalusia that wants to halt legal aid for women beaten by men, saying it unfairly favours the woman.

Jose Javier Salvador Calvo shot dead his wife, Patricia Maurel Conte, 29, in May 2003 in Spain's north-eastern region of Aragon.

Released under licence in 2017, the killer began an affair with Rebeca Santamalia Cáncer, 47, the lawyer who had defended him at his trial, Spanish media report.

Police found the lawyer stabbed to death at Salvador Calvo's home in Aragon's regional capital, Zaragoza, just after 04:00 (03:00 GMT) on Friday after her husband reported her missing.

A few hours earlier, around midnight, the suspected murderer had jumped from a bridge in Teruel, a town 150km (93 miles) to the south, after being spotted by a police patrol.

Local government representative Carmen Sánchez told reporters that the lawyer had been a victim of ""gender violence"".

On Twitter, Prime Minister Sánchez said that four women had been murdered in Spain in recent days and there must be no retreat in addressing the ""horror"".

Last year in Spain, 47 women were murdered, four of them in Aragon, in crimes of gender violence.

The killing of teacher Laura Luelmo, 26, last month in Andalusia caused a wave of revulsion in the country. Her partially-naked body had been found near a village after five days of searching.

A man living locally later confessed to murdering her after attempting to rape her, Spanish newspaper El País reports.

Three-quarters of the public funding for the 11-day event will come from central government, with £184m having to be found by Birmingham City Council.

The budget is above initial estimates of £750m, but lower than the £967m spent on the 2018 Gold Coast Games.

It will be the most expensive sports event in the UK since the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

""The Games will be the biggest sporting and cultural event ever held in the city,"" said sports minister Mims Davies.

""Watched by one and a half billion people worldwide, this is a massive opportunity to showcase the best that Birmingham, the West Midlands and the whole UK has to offer.

""The Games budget is a significant investment in Birmingham and the region that will deliver benefits to local people for years to come. It will increase participation and encourage more people to get active and stay active, and to volunteer to be part of this fantastic event 10 years on from London 2012.""

Although most facilities for the event are already built, the central venue - the Alexander Stadium - is having a £70m upgrade, with a long-term tenant yet to be announced.

Council chiefs are in talks with Birmingham City University about a potential partnership that could see part of the university campus move to the site.

A £60m aquatics centre is being built in Sandwell, and £350m is being spent on the athletes' village in Perry Barr, which will then be turned into 1,500 homes.

Birmingham City Council's financial position was described as ""immensely serious"" by a government-commissioned independent panel earlier this year.

There have been £642m of cuts made since 2011 with a further £123m expected by 2021-22. The council is borrowing £50m to help pay for the event but insists it will not affect spending on local services.

""The level of investment coming into the city and the wider West Midlands as a result of our decision to successfully bid for the right to host the Commonwealth Games is huge,"" said council leader Ian Ward.

""The Games are undoubtedly a catalyst, bringing forward many regeneration and infrastructure schemes, so they are delivered much quicker than we could have done otherwise.

""The event also gives us a golden opportunity to reposition the city and region on a global stage and bring citizens together.""

The 2022 Games were originally awarded to the South African city of Durban in 2015, but it was then stripped of the event because it did not meet key Commonwealth Games Federation criteria.

Birmingham was named as the replacement host 18 months ago, and now has just three years before staging one of the world's biggest multi-sport events.

This investment is expected to deliver significant benefits for Birmingham, the West Midlands and the UK long after the 11 days of sport are over.

Organisers say Birmingham 2022 will open up a wealth of opportunities, including business and trade, cultural engagement, volunteering, physical activity, jobs and skills, education and tourism. Over one million tickets will be made available for spectators from across the UK and around the world.

Additional commercial revenue will be raised by the Birmingham 2022 organising committee and Commonwealth Games Federation partnerships through ticket sales, sponsorship, merchandising and the sale of broadcast rights.

Regular financial updates on the budget will be provided in the lead-up to the Games, with the organising committee also laying its accounts before Parliament.

Commonwealth Games Federation president Dame Louise Martin: ""An important element of the budget detail is the significant decrease in direct Games delivery costs compared to Gold Coast 2018.""

Mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street: ""Investment in the region is already being unlocked thanks to the Games, with improvements to public transport and the regeneration of Perry Barr well under way. We expect the wider benefits of hosting the Games, including the economic and tourism boost, to last long into the future.""

A spokesperson for the organisers: ""Birmingham 2022 offers a unique opportunity to harness the power of sport and cultural activities to boost the West Midlands region and to promote global Britain across the Commonwealth as we leave the EU.

""The evidence from previous host cities demonstrates the significant benefits of staging the Games. Gold Coast 2018 is expected to have delivered a £1.3bn boost to the Queensland economy.""",Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games to cost £778m,sport,sport event,707

2735,abcnews,"Key takeaways from Associated Press reporting showing that new laws in 15 states could clear the way for a deluge of lawsuits against the Roman Catholic Church:

— Many of the dozen-plus lawyers and clergy abuse watchdog groups interviewed by the AP expect at least 5,000 new cases, resulting in potential payouts that could surpass the $4 billion paid out since the clergy sex abuse first came to light in the 1980s.

— The legal onslaught will play out in some of the nation’s most populous Catholic strongholds. This summer, New York state opened its one-year window allowing sex abuse claims no matter how old, and already hundreds of lawsuits have been filed. A two-year window in New Jersey opens this week, then a three-year window in California opens in the new year that allows triple damages if the church tried to cover up the abuse.

— Some lawyers believe payouts by juries will be bigger than ever because of a recent national reawakening over sex abuse, fueled by the #MeToo movement, the public shaming of accused celebrities and last year’s Pennsylvania grand jury report that found 300 priests abused more than 1,000 children in that state. Since then, attorneys general in nearly 20 states have launched investigations of their own.

— The church is hoping victims turn to compensation funds set up by dioceses offering faster, but typically much lower payments than if they took their claims to court. To soften the financial hit, more dioceses are likely to file for bankruptcy, too. Less than a month after New York’s window took effect, the upstate Diocese of Rochester filed for bankruptcy, the 20th U.S. diocese or religious order to do so.",Key points from new wave of Catholic abuse lawsuits,"crime, law and justice",law,278
984718,thesun,"HOLLYOAKS fans spotted a major blunder on Wednesday night as Mercedes McQueen should have been DEAD after ""bleeding out"" for 12 hours.

Viewers shouted foul play on Twitter after scheming Mercedes - who is played by actress Jennifer Metcalfe in the Channel 4 soap - was ambushed by one of her seven enemies and shot in last night's episode.

Goldie found Mercedes in the loft after Nana raised her suspicions over her granddaughter's whereabouts.

After paramedics rushed Mercedes to hospital, Sylver told Nana and Goldie at the hospital: ""She's in an induced coma and they say it could be sepsis.

""It's a miracle she is alive, if it was a few inches to the left...""

However viewers were not convinced that Mercedes would have survived at all after being left alone for up to 12 hours overnight.

One said: ""Mercedes would have bled out by now. #Hollyoaks""

Another fan tweeted: ""Mercedes really should be dead from a loss of blood! #Hollyoaks""

Hollyoaks opened tonight with Taylor Swift's track Look What You Made Me Do in a nod to the shooting at the club.

There are seven suspects with James Nightingale, Grace Black, Breda McQueen, Sylver McQueen, Liam Donovan, Joel Dexter and Diane Hutchinson all in the frame for the attempted murder.

And eagle-eyed fans also think they spotted which of the seven official suspects actually pulled the trigger.

One wrote: ""I bet it’s going be Diane!""

A second said: ""Diane is the one who shot Mercedes - that earlier convo with Edward was a clue #Hollyoaks"".

Another added: ""They’re going to find Diane’s blood at the scene when Mercedes is shot aren’t they? Also, why hasn’t anyone called the police yet?""

The attempted murder came after Mercedes confronted all of her enemies and gave them what for after they tried to scam her by stealing drinks from her pub.

She terrified James by walking towards him and pulling her phone out like a gun, before telling him how Harry only wanted him for his money and then turning to Grace and warning her about her own murders.

Joel was next with her ripping into him about his knowing her secrets and his secret meeting with Cleo, while Goldie got a mouthful for being a ""market knockoff"".

Diane was called out for her behaviour towards Harry before he died, and her evil rapist son Finn being welcomed back into the village.

""I would rather be dead and buried instead of being stuck here with you,"" she said as she stormed out to the loft where someone tried to help her along the way by shooting her.

She ran into Liam first and when he rejected her she told him how she had had a termination of his baby.

193937,eveningstandard,"Jose Mourinho believes Antonio Rudiger should be the one under scrutiny for his role in Heung-min Son's red card, rather than the Tottenham player.

The South Korean was dismissed in the second half of Sunday's 2-0 loss to Chelsea when VAR showed he kicked out at Rudiger in retaliation to being fouled.

Referee Anthony Taylor did not penalise Son, but VAR official Paul Tierney decided differently and advised Taylor to issue a red card.

Spurs have appealed against the decision, which came before the alleged racist abuse of the Chelsea defender, and are waiting to hear from the Football Association whether their player must serve a three-match ban.

But Mourinho, who sarcastically wished Rudiger well in his recovery from ""broken ribs"" after the game, says the German's over-the-top reaction should be in focus.

""I hope the Premier League is still the Premier League and will always be the Premier League and I think the focus should be on Antonio Rudiger and not on Son,"" Mourinho said.

""I'm not speaking about the racism incident, this is another thing. I am speaking about that incident, the red card.

""In the Premier League I love there is no space also for what Rudiger did. Stand up and play man. This is the Premier League.

""In some countries, especially now Latin cultures, you go to Latin America, Portugal, Spain, Italy and that happens, it is a cultural thing, but not in the Premier League, and the moment we try to punish the reaction of some player, insignificant reaction, but you try to punish and you let it go the other one, it is because then you become part of it (complicit).

""That's why I was trying to joke and making a bit of fun about it.

""Come on, do you think Rudiger plays the next game or do you think he's injured? I think he plays.

""And we speak about Son and don't speak about him.""

Nevertheless, it is Son's third red card of 2019 for a petulant act as he was sent off for pushing Jefferson Lerma at Bournemouth last season, then for a tackle on Everton's Andre Gomes in November that broke the midfielder's ankle.

Spurs also appealed against both dismissals, winning the latter.

Mourinho does not think Son has a temper problem, however, and insisted he was in control against Rudiger.

""A tiny reaction is an emotional reaction but is still an emotional reaction with control,"" the Portuguese said.

""I don't think it is different, what happened with (Mateo) Kovacic and Dele (Alli) (both players booked for grappling), with what happened with Son and Rudiger.

""For me the insignificant is insignificant. To send somebody home and to stop him doing his work and be on the pitch is not about insignificant, it is about significant.

""If you do an accumulation of insignificance then is when you arrive at the accumulation of yellow cards and you have two yellow cards for insignificant fouls you go out.

""But when you do in the game one insignificant foul that is not a red card, that is a yellow card.""

212645,foxnews,"Before they announce that they're running for Congress, most candidates ensure they've locked up the rights to relevant Internet domain names.

But after it emerged late Monday that former Democratic House candidate Jon Ossoff, 32, would challenge Republican Sen. David Perdue in 2020, it quickly became clear that his campaign hadn't taken that important step.

Indeed, the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) has purchased www.JonOssoff.com. Now, visitors are redirected to an article in The Washington Examiner titled, ""Jon Ossoff, top Democratic congressional candidate, raises questions with misleading resume.""

The NRSC said it would continue to maintain the website throughout Ossoff's run.

“JonOssoff.com will have all the details about Jon Ossoff’s resume,"" National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesman Nathan Brand told Fox News. ""Since Ossoff is a serial resume inflator, voters will need a good source for all the news about Ossoff’s misleading claims and left-wing views.”

Ossoff rose to prominence two years ago riding a wave of dissatisfaction with Washington, and his campaign for Georgia's 6th Congressional District was backed nationally by enthusiastic supporters, even though he lived outside the district.

Ossoff raised roughly $30 million in the 2017 special election for the seat but lost to Republican Karen Handel.

But he turned heads by claiming in an advertisement, among other boasts, that he had been a national security aide with a ""top-secret clearance.""

""I've got five years of experience as a national security staffer in the U.S. Congress,"" Ossoff said. ""I held top-secret security clearance.""

One of his campaign ads claimed that “as a national security aide with top-secret clearance, Jon Ossoff saw waste and abuse by military contractors and sought to stop it.""

The Washington Post's fact-checker, Glenn Kessler, rated Ossoff's claims misleading, noting that Ossoff did not actually hold a top-secret clearance for the whole five years that he worked in Congress. Instead, he held the clearance for five months.

""Moreover, declaring himself a 'senior national security staffer' is also bit too much résumé puffery,"" Kessler observed. ""Ossoff did not even work on the staff of a major committee, such as Armed Services or International Relations. Instead, he was an aide to a relatively low-ranking member of Congress.""

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution also reported that the Ossoff campaign had claimed that the candidate received the security clearance after the 2006 election, only to reveal under pressure that he received the clearance in March 2012.

Cybersquatting laws, which prevent entities from buying up trademarked domain names in bad faith, do not generally apply to the purchase of domain names that include the non-trademarked names of popular figures.

Despite the past disappointments and bluster, Ossoff, the fourth Georgia Democrat to join the race that could help determine control of the Senate, confidently announced his bid Monday night during an appearance on ""The Last Word"" on MSNBC.

""I'm running because we face a crisis of political corruption in this country,"" Ossoff told host Lawrence O'Donnell, calling Perdue a ""caricature of Washington corruption.""

Ossoff cited Congress' failure to take up gun control legislation and political influence at scientific institutions as examples of corruption.

Perdue, a former Fortune 500 company chief executive, has emerged as a close ally of President Trump after being elected in 2014.

Perdue's isn't the only Georgia Senate seat that's up for grabs. Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson announced his retirement late last month due to health issues, and a special election to fill the remaining two years of his term will be on the November 2020 ballot.

The two open Senate seats have raised Georgia's status as a must-watch 2020 battleground. While Ossoff will face a primary contest in the race for Perdue's seat, the race for Isakson's seat won't have any primary and will instead be open to all qualified candidates.

Here are four key transfer stories that you may have missed so far today…

And Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly is reportedly keen on a move to Old Trafford - but it won't happen until the end of the season.

The towering Senegal international fits the bill of what United are looking for. He's powerful and experienced, but not too old at 27.

And although Ed Woodward would ideally want to snap up him up now, Napoli won't allow it.

The Metro report he's key to their Europa League chances and is staying at the Stadio San Paolo.

Koulibaly is likely to cost around £90m after signing a new long-term deal at Napoli only last year.

Long-term Chelsea target Gonzalo Higuain has agreed to join the Stamford Bridge side, according to reports in Spain.

Marca say the deal will be completed in the next few hours, with the 31-year-old becoming the London club's second signing of the transfer window after Christain Pulisic.

Higuain's arrival will signal the departure of Alvaro Morata - with Sevilla keen on the Spaniard.

Higuain has been on loan at AC Milan from Juventus but has not hit form this season and Chelsea are prepared to pay his €40m transfer fee as well as his €8m a year wages.

Tottenham aim to end any Real Madrid and Barcelona interest from by putting a massive £225m price tag on Christian Eriksen.

The 26-year-old has a deal running until 2020 and so far has not indicated he will sign an extension.

But now Spurs owner Daniel Levy says the Spanish giants would have to make him the most expensive footballer on the planet to prise him away from North London, report AS.

A few days ago Real Madrid reportedly made contract over a stunning deal for the Tottenham playmaker.

The Dane has another 18 months remaining on his current deal with Spurs but there is a determination to get him tied down long-term.

Barcelona star Denis Suarez wants to join Arsenal in January.

Mirror Sport understands the 25-year-old midfielder is making it clear he fancies the switch this month and is hoping the clubs can make it happen.

Arsenal are keen on Suarez and he is their No1 target as they look to do a loan move with a view to a permanent £15m transfer this summer.

Barcelona are reluctant to let Suarez leave this month even though he has a buy-out clause in his contract and there is still some way to go before a deal looks remotely likely.

But it is believed that is currently the only serious deal that Arsenal are working on at the moment as Unai Emery knows there are very limited funds in this window.

Mirror Sport reported on December 22 that Arsenal were not expecting a busy window because of the financial restrictions and it could just come down to one small deal and a potential loan.

That position has not changed and would rule out any chance of big deals this month, although Emery will be afforded cash to make more significant signings in the summer.",Transfer news and gossip: Kalidou Koulibaly 'keen on Man Utd as Higuain Chelsea bound,sport,transfer,612
3031,abcnews,"More than a century ago, waves of Catholic immigrants from Ireland, Poland and Quebec settled in Chicopee and other western Massachusetts mill towns, helping build churches, rectories and schools to accommodate their faith. Today the priests leading those churches are under siege due to stresses, challenges and sex abuse scandals complicating their lives and those of their fellow priests across the United States.

The Rev. Mark Stelzer is among those trying to persevere. He's a professor at a Roman Catholic college in Chicopee, and its chaplain. He travels frequently to out-of-state events organized by a Catholic addiction-treatment provider, recounting his own recovery from alcoholism.

Last year, his busy schedule got busier. Amid a worsening shortage of priests, the Diocese of Springfield named him administrator of a parish in Holyoke, Chicopee’s northern neighbor, where he lives alone in a mansion-sized rectory while serving as spiritual leader to the 500 families of St. Jerome’s Church.

“I’m at an age where I thought I’d be doing less rather than doing more,” said Stelzer, 62.

Stelzer loves being a priest, yet he's frank about the ever-evolving stresses of his vocation that leave him nostalgic for the priesthood he entered in 1983.

“It was a lot simpler then,” he said. “There’s a real longing, a mourning for the church that was — when there was a greater fraternity among priests, and the church was not facing these scandals that are now emerging every day.”

Stelzer’s concerns echoed those of other priests, and some of their psychological caregivers, who were interviewed by The Associated Press.

Weighing on the entire Catholic clergy in the U.S. is the ripple effect of their church’s long-running crisis arising from sex abuse committed by priests. It’s caused many honorable priests to sense an erosion of public support and to question the leadership of some of their bishops. That dismay is often compounded by increased workloads due to the priest shortage, and increased isolation as multi-priest parishes grow scarce. They see trauma firsthand. Some priests minister in parishes wracked by gun violence; others preside frequently over funerals of drug-overdose victims.

One such victim was a 31-year-old woman whose family was among Stelzer’s closest friends. “This is one of the few times I actually felt my voice quivering,” he said of the funeral service he led last year.

Burnout has been a perennial problem for clergy of many faiths. But Thomas Plante, a psychology professor at California's Santa Clara University who has screened or treated hundreds of Catholic clerics, sees new forms of it as the sex abuse crisis persists and many parishioners lose trust in Catholic leadership.

“You’re just trying to be a good priest and now everyone thinks you’re a sex offender,” he said. “If you walk in a park with your collar on, people think you’re on the lookout for children. ... Some have been spat upon.”

The Springfield diocese, like many across the U.S., has a long history of sex-abuse scandals. In the early 1990s, priest Richard Lavigne was defrocked and several of his victims received cash settlements. In 2004, a grand jury indicted Thomas Dupre on two counts of child molestation soon after he resigned following a 13-year stint as Springfield’s bishop.

Stelzer had hoped the abuse crisis was abating but it resurfaced dramatically over the past two years. Abuse allegations led to former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick’s ouster from the priesthood and a Pennsylvania grand jury report asserted that about 300 priests had abused at least 1,000 children in the state over seven decades.

“It opened up an old wound and now we're back to ground zero,” Stelzer said in an interview at the College of Our Lady of the Elms.

The wound is self-inflicted, said Rev. Philip Schmitter, 74, who has served for 50 years in Flint, Michigan. His stance endears him to an African American community where he lived in public housing for three decades to maintain close ties.

“This cover up, this ‘Let's protect the institution’ was just a heinous, utterly unchristian kind of behavior,” he said.

Two miles north of Stelzer’s campus, on a recent Sunday, the Rev. William Tourigny was getting ready for the 4 p.m. Mass — his fourth and last of the day — at Ste. Rose de Lima Church.

When Tourigny, now 66, was ordained in 1980, the Springfield diocese had more than 300 priests serving 136 parishes. Since then, the ranks of priests have shrunk by more than half and nearly 60 of the parishes have closed. For Tourigny, it’s meant many more funerals to handle, including dozens related to drug overdoses and heavy drinking.

Even his own family has been scarred: Tourigny says the 27-year-old daughter of his first cousin was killed in circumstances he describes as fueled by her drug habit.

“But for her addiction, she was a wonderful mother,” Tourigny said.

Tourigny says he’s worked nearly 40 years without a real vacation. For years, he’s had therapy sessions, which he describes as “crucially important,” and he strives to minister compassionately without being engulfed in the emotions of those he consoles.

“I can share their pain but I can’t enter into it,” he said. “I’d be overwhelmed by grief.”

With 2,500 families, many of Polish and French Canadian descent, Tourigny's parish has fared better with membership and finances than several nearby parishes. Yet Tourigny says many Catholics now mistrust the church hierarchy because of the flawed response to the abuse scandals.

“I was ordained at a time when the church was so alive — there was so much optimism,” he said. “Then things began to change quickly. It has changed the way people look at us. The church has lost credibility and it’s hard to get credibility back again.”

Plante, the California psychologist, says even priests deeply devoted to their work are upset.

“A lot are angry at bishops and the institutional church for screwing up — a lot of them feel they’ve been thrown under the bus,” he said. “They’re also concerned that one of these days someone will accuse them of misbehavior, even if they’ve done nothing wrong. They’re asking, 'Did I do something 30 years ago that could be misconstrued, that will come back and haunt me?'”

The Rev. Stephen Fichter, pastor of St. Elizabeth Church in Wyckoff, New Jersey, said he has counseled people who’ve been abused by Catholic clergy and understands the “pain and horror” they experienced. Yet he voiced concerns on behalf of priests with unblemished careers who feel vulnerable to unwarranted suspicions.

“Sometimes a priest is confronted by an anonymous accusation from 30 or 40 years ago, and doesn’t have a chance to defend himself,” Fichter said. “It used to be innocent until proven guilty. Now a lot of priests feel it’s been turned upside down.”

Mark Stelzer proudly identifies himself as an alumnus of Guest House, a residential facility in Michigan that has specialized in addiction treatment for Catholic clergy since 1956. He travels frequently to make presentations on behalf of Guest House, and teaches a course at his Chicopee college titled “Addiction and Recovery.”

By the time he was ordained, Stelzer says, he was consuming alcohol daily. Only after five more years of steady drinking did acquaintances suggest he had a problem, leading to his stay at Guest House.

Guest House’s president, Jeff Henrich, is an experienced drug and alcohol counselor. He says substance abuse among priests is a longstanding problem but has been aggravated by recent developments — including the “residual shame” arising from the sex-abuse scandals and increased isolation as more priests now manage parishes on their own.

Since 1985, according to researchers at Georgetown University, the Catholic population in the U.S. has risen by nearly 20%, but the number of priests has plunged from more than 57,000 to under 37,000.

“There’s fewer of them and more work to do,” Henrich said. “That means you’re far more likely to live alone than ever before — and very few of us were meant to live alone.”

In response, treatment experts urge priests in recovery to find companionship in a support group and to form friendships outside their ministry.

Stelzer agrees that isolation raises the risks of substance abuse.

“We’re lone rangers,” he said. “Substance abuse might go undetected for longer when you’re living alone. A lot of those in treatment now say it was because of isolation, working harder and longer, and not feeling support from leadership.”

The harmful consequences of the priest shortage have come to the attention of the Vatican's ambassador to the U.S., Archbishop Christophe Pierre. Addressing U.S. bishops in November, he urged them to be attentive to their priests’ health, spiritual well-being and sense of priestly fraternity.

“Many priests are saying they no longer know one another,” Pierre said. “Others, due to the priest shortage, are forced to live in isolation, managing multiple parishes.”

Stress, burnout, depression and addictions are among the conditions treated at St. Luke Institute, a residential treatment center for Catholic clergy and lay leaders, in Silver Spring, Maryland.

St. Luke’s president, the Rev. David Songy, is a psychologist who has worked extensively with troubled priests. One growing problem, he says, is that new priests are now often assigned their own parish within three years, instead of 10 or more in the past, and may be ill-prepared to oversee finances and personnel as well as pastoral duties.

“Some of the younger people that come to us — they’ve been overwhelmed and weren’t sure how to deal with things,” Songy said. Stress, burnout, depression and addictions are among the conditions treated at St. Luke Institute, a residential treatment center for Catholic clergy and lay leaders, in Silver Spring, Maryland.

Other stressful changes relate to ideological differences. Tourigny considers himself a progressive and has welcomed lesbian couples into Ste. Rita. He says many young priests now emerging from seminary are less tolerant of LGBTQ congregants and eager to revive the tradition of celebrating Mass in Latin.

Another change noted by several priests: Some parishioners, rather than showing deference to their pastors, openly challenge them.

“In the past they might have disagreed, but they’d be courteous. Now it’s different,” said Fichter. “They think you are not Republican enough or Democratic enough depending on which end of the political spectrum they occupy. ... They want you to preach what they want to hear, and they will confront you.”

At St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, New York — just north of New York City — there’s increased emphasis on screening applicants for their ability to handle stress and avoid the burnout that’s now affecting some priests even early in their ministry.

“There’s no doubt these men coming forward are facing what will be a very stressful life,” said the Rev. Thomas Berg, the seminary’s vice rector. “We must be sure they have the skill set or will be able to develop it.”

“On top of that, in some places, you don’t have a sense that their bishop supports them,” added Berg. “In plenty of dioceses, priests are essentially treated as outside contractors — there’s a lack of a genuinely caring relationship.”

Police officers, firefighters and paramedics are collectively labeled first responders. Henrich, the Guest House president, says priests also merit that label.

“They see trauma and loss on a very regular basis,” he said. “They get called out to hospitals, deal with grieving families, with lost and dead children.”

Gun violence is the plague besetting the Rev. Mike Pfleger’s parish in an African American area of Chicago.

""It's a war zone,” says Pfleger, an outspoken pastor at Saint Sabina Church since 1981. “Doing funerals of children is the hardest for me.”

The violence has ripple effects: he says parents of slain young people go through divorce, mental breakdowns, addiction.

“It becomes overwhelming when it’s day in and day out, and you don’t have the resources to meet the needs,” he said.

Now 70, Pfleger says his health is good, and his work rewarding. Yet he says he and his colleagues risk being overwhelmed by the crises facing their neighborhood of Auburn Gresham.

“I was seeing myself becoming depressed, after several violent deaths in a short span,” he said. “I needed to make sure I talked to somebody.

“Last year I didn’t take any days off — I realized that was a big mistake,” he added. “It’s important to have people around you to say, ‘Are you OK?’”

In Brunswick, Ohio, a town of 34,000 people 20 miles (30 kilometers) southeast of Cleveland, the Rev. Robert Stec’s priorities have been transformed, due to the scourge of opioids, since he became pastor of St. Ambrose Church in 2005.

In 2016, Brunswick’s Medina County reported 20 opioid-related deaths. Stec presided over six funerals of those victims in a short span. While sharing parishioners’ grief, Stec resolved to combat the opioid epidemic and founded a multifaith coalition of Northeast Ohio religious leaders.

Stec is grateful that Brunswick has better-than-average mental health services. But he and his fellow priests in drug-ravaged towns still employ a triage policy, seeking help for the most dire cases, because they can’t provide comprehensive support to every affected parishioner.

“We weren’t trained for this in the seminary,” he said.

Still the priests treasure their jobs despite the challenges. Mark Stelzer holds onto his role as a comforter. “For a lot of people, I’m the last person they saw while they were still alive,” he said. “There's an energy and grace in those moments.”

102613,cnn,"Washington (CNN) The United States is beginning to prep allies for a spring rollout of its plan for Middle East peace, with President Donald Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, outlining the timing and methodology of the plan at the Middle East security conference in Warsaw, Poland.

During a presentation Thursday, Kushner confirmed that the Trump administration will not release its peace plan prior to Israel's elections in April, according to a senior administration official present in the room.

After a series of meetings at the Munich Security Conference this weekend, Kushner will spend the end of the month, alongside Jason Greenblatt, Trump's former personal lawyer who is now an adviser on Israel, on a trip to present economic elements of the plan to wealthy Arab allies.

Kushner's presentation was the first chance international diplomats had to hear about the Trump administration's efforts to resolve the decades-long conflict. The President's son-in-law and his team have kept a tight wrap on the substance of his plan, refusing to share details with traditional US partners on Mideast peace efforts, including allies in the region and in Europe.

The silence surrounding the plan has become a source of frustration and uncertainty that some diplomats worry could eventually scuttle the proposal's chances.

Kushner has rebuffed major US allies' requests to circulate the plan, one diplomat said, as he and his team are reportedly fearful that its contents would leak out and the proposal would be scuttled before they have a chance to roll it out.

But the diplomat told CNN that the silence and secrecy could contribute to the plan's failure. This diplomat said major US allies hope to see the proposal early so they can identify snags or build support, but they have been met with silence, which has left them frustrated.

""We're not being told anything,"" a second diplomat said. These allies very much want to help out in the process if they can, but they feel left out and many have voiced frustration.

One concern the allies have is they will learn about the substance of the plan so late in the game that it's impossible to weigh in with changes -- and that it could be something they can't support.

One source familiar with discussions between countries said this is particularly a concern in Arab countries that will get briefed on the economic portion of the proposal -- which they will be asked to fund.

""This is not likely to go well -- the economic piece is seen in the region as shorthand for trying to buy the Palestinians off,"" the source said. ""It's important to get Arab buy-in. You need the main Arab players to urge the Palestinians not to say no. ... You want them to go to (Palestinian Authority President) Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) and say, 'Don't dismiss it. Give it a thought. Let's see what elements you can live with.' For that to happen,"" the source said, Arab countries ""have to feel that they are co-owners of this thing. They have to be privy"" to the substance of the plan.

That source cautioned that while almost nothing is known about the proposal, it is expected to skew heavily in favor of Israel and is expected to use nonlegal language, not the internationally established and accepted jargon associated with past peace proposals.

The style and choice of the language, the source said, is an attempt to speak directly to Palestinians in the hope that they can be used to pressure Abbas to accept the plan. It is not expected to mention a two-state solution, the source said, but explains how Palestinian self-determination will manifest itself.

In Poland on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu told those gathered at Kushner's briefing that he will not prejudge the plan before it is put out and he hopes that Palestinians, who refused to attend the meeting, will do so as well, according to the senior administration official in the room.

Talks between the US and Palestinians broke down after Trump's December 2017 decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a rejection of international consensus that the issue should be resolved toward the end of peace negotiations.

The US has also closed the Palestinian diplomatic presence in Washington and cut aid to Palestinian refugees, deepening the chill between the two sides, leading Palestinians to declare that the US had forfeited its position as a neutral arbiter in the conflict.

A diplomat familiar with the peace plan discussions said the US had asked Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the US, Prince Khalid bin Salman, to try to get Palestinian leadership to attend the summit. He was unsuccessful.

An Arab diplomat said the United Arab Emirates had also asked the Palestinians to come to Warsaw -- but they said no. Their reasoning, the diplomat said, is that the US has not done anything in their favor, giving them little reason to attend the conference.

""We can try to talk and give some advice, but can't force them to do anything,"" a Saudi diplomat told CNN. ""We do not have the power to tell people not to go or to go. But we always try to bridge opinions when we can.""

The senior administration official said rollout of the peace plan has been delayed by a number of external factors. Kushner and his team were supposed to visit the countries that are to be involved with the economic portion of the proposal in October, but that got pushed back after Khashoggi's murder.

US elections in November created another roadblock, along with the partial government shutdown in January. But some analysts said the delay until after April's elections may be about helping Netanyahu, an old family friend of Kushner's who is facing corruption allegations and political headwinds.

Even if the Israeli leader wins the elections in April, the political baggage he carries -- including the possibility he may get indicted on corruption charges -- may make it hard for him to assemble a coalition. But if the administration puts forward a peace plan after the election, various Israeli political parties might want to join the coalition to be part of that process.

""Netanyahu might be keen on having the plan coming out after the election and before coalition formation, so it could be a pivot point to broaden his coalition,"" said David Makovsky, of the Washington Institute of Near East Policy.

Schanzer said the proposal's rollout could just as easily sink the prime minister, who has drawn some red lines about what he will and will not accept.

Netanyahu's conditions include an Israeli security presence along the Jordan River -- the western edge of any future Palestinian state -- for decades. And he has said in the past that he will not divide Jerusalem, even as Palestinians say they want to establish their capital there as well.

""I think it could be a bomb they are going to drop on the Israeli political system. ... No matter when this thing is rolled out, there is a possibility that this plan blows up Netanyahu's chance at being prime minister even if he wins the election,"" Schanzer said. ""This could disrupt his ability to hold together a coalition because of what he would be asked to give up.""",Kushner readies for spring launch of US Middle East peace plan,"conflict, war and peace",peace process,1187
8184,aljazeera,"New Delhi, India - Over 100 million people will be taking a holy dip at the confluence of two rivers in northern India's Prayagraj city as the eight-week-long Kumbh festival began on Tuesday.

The Kumbh, billed as the world's biggest gathering of humanity, is a mass pilgrimage in which Hindus gather in specific locations along the holy rivers Ganges, Yamuna and the mythical river Saraswati for a holy dip that they believe will cleanse their sins and bring salvation.

The religious event in the Uttar Pradesh state, which will continue till March 4, is being organised by the right-wing governments at both the federal and state levels in an election year.

Astrology determines most aspects of the UNESCO-listed festival, including its exact date and length. Where the festival will be held depends on the positions of the planet Jupiter, sun and the Earth.

""It is an exhilarating experience. To be part of a sea of humanity that arrives to take a dip in the holy waters, it is humbling and joyful. You abandon your fears at the Kumbh and hopefully your sins,"" Gopal Mishra, a devout Hindu who has been to the festival several times, told Al Jazeera.

There are six particularly auspicious days to bathe, termed as Shahi Snan, meaning a royal bath. The biggest bathing day is February 4, when approximately 30 million people are expected to take a dip.

The first Shahi Snan began before the dawn on Tuesday.

""Teams will be managing crowds on the river bank. All roads leading to the Kumbh Mela grounds will be packed with hundreds of thousands of pilgrims in the coming days,"" Bimlesh Kumar, a senior official at the government tourism department told Al Jazeera.

""We are expecting around 120 million people, and an additional two million foreign visitors this year. The festival will continue for 49 days. An average two million people are likely to take a dip every day,"" he added.

Prayagraj city had been preparing for the festival for months as the government built communal areas with 20,000 beds and a tented city with 4,200 ""premium"" tents around the river.

According to a report, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led federal and state governments are spending over $620m, more than triple the public money spent in 2013 on the same event.

The government says 116 roads have been constructed and 524 shuttle buses deployed to transport the pilgrims. More than 122,000 toilets have been built for the attendees.

On Tuesday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted to say he hoped visitors to this year's Kumbh would ""experience India's spiritual, cultural and social diversities"".

Translated tweet: ""Good wishes for the sacred Kumbh Mela starting at Prayagraj. I hope the devotees from India and abroad will get a glimpse of the country's spiritual, cultural and social diversities. I wish more and more people become part of this divine and grand event.""

The relentless promotion of Kumbh by the ruling BJP coincides with the general election due in a few months.

The BJP's electoral losses in five Indian states last month have shown a dip in Modi's popularity.

The ruling party is making renewed appeals to its hardcore Hindu nationalist base in Uttar Pradesh, India's politically most important state, which is hosting this year's Kumbh.

Ahead of the Kumbh gathering, BJP leader and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath changed the name of the historical city of Allahabad to the more ""Hindu"" sounding Prayagraj.

The BJP has also announced the construction of a giant statue of Hindu deity Ram in the state.

In contrast, the state police are cracking down on Muslims praying in open areas like parks.

Earlier in 2018, the Indian government had also announced the end of a decades-long policy of giving subsidy to thousands of Muslims heading to the holy city of Mecca to perform the annual Hajj pilgrimage.

Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state with 200 million people, sends 80 MPs to Parliament's lower house, the reason it is a politically crucial state.

Opposition parties say the government is trying to hide its failures in governance and is promoting itself in the media instead of the Kumbh festival.

Images of Modi and Adityanath are splashed on Kumbh promotional billboards across Prayagraj city.

""Kumbh is not a substitute for effective governance. The BJP often behaves like a publicity and marketing company. This holy festival has always been organised by the government. But money was never spent such lavishly, solely for advertisements of the government,"" Akhilesh Pratap Singh, national spokesperson of the Congress party, told Al Jazeera in Lucknow.

""At the moment, people want answers from them. Where are the jobs for our youth, safety for women, rule of law, industry? It's not possible for them to deflect attention from their governance failures any more,"" he added.

The Kumbh has been marred several times by stampedes. Over 800 people were killed in 1954, 40 died in Nashik western India in 2003, while 36 people died in the 2013 gathering in Allahabad (now Prayagraj).

On Monday, a small fire broke out at one of the camps, although no casualties were reported.

Hindu religious belief says that in a fight over an urn between the gods and the demons, a few drops of the essence of immortality spilled on to four places on the Earth, which now host the Kumbh, one of which is Prayagraj.

There are three different kinds of Kumbh: an Ardha (or half) Kumbh held every six years at two locations, a Purna (or full) Kumbh every 12 years at four locations and a Maha Kumbh that happens every 144 years or after 12 Purna Kumbhs.

Critics of the Modi government say a half Kumbh is being given unprecedented prominence this time and there is a conscious attempt to boost support for events that reinforce Hindu symbols appealing to the BJP's Hindu nationalist support base.

India's 1.3 billion people are about 80 percent Hindu and appeals to religion or caste are deeply ingrained in Indian politics.

A report by the investigative magazine Caravan last month said the BJP's ideological mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), is attempting to drum up support for the government using the Kumbh ahead of the elections.

Hindu supremacist groups such as the RSS and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) are clamouring for a government order to bypass the Supreme Court in order to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya city of Uttar Pradesh.

In 1992, a Hindu mob tore down a medieval mosque, which they claim stood at a contested site believed to be the birthplace of Ram.

""Right from the Babri mosque demolition, the right-wing in India always uses religious congregation to promote Hindutva or a militant radical strain of Hinduism backed by the current ruling party. Previous Kumbh festivals from the mid-1980s onwards have been fertile ground for making political demands,"" Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a political analyst in New Delhi, told Al Jazeera.

But the ruling BJP denies any political overtones to the festival.

""It is a sacred and auspicious time for Hindus. Kumbh has a special place in not just the religious but cultural life of Indians. Every government, irrespective of ideology, has been organising this festival at a mega scale,"" Sudhanshu Mittal, spokesperson of the ruling BJP, told Al Jazeera.

On January 31 and February 1, a Dharma Sansad (religious assembly) will be held at the Kumbh by the VHP, one of the many far-right Hindu groups linked to the ruling BJP party.

On the opening day of the festival, the Indian media reported slogans of ""Modi, you lead the fight, we are with you"" and ""the temple will be built in Ayodhya"" being raised on loudspeakers amid religious Hindu chants.

The idea is to use Kumbh as a rallying point, says Akshaya Mukul, the author of ""Gita Press and the Making of Hindu India"".

""In the times of divided polity and an election year, a Hindu nationalist party like BJP will definitely extract political mileage out of it. Social media is abuzz with videos praising the BJP for its arrangements. Apparently, never before has a state administration worked so hard,"" Mukul told Al Jazeera.

""It is ironic that in a state where infants die for the lack of oxygen, arrangement of a religious fair is seen as a marker of good administration,"" he said, referring to a 2017 tragedy in which more than 60 infants died for lack of oxygen in a state-run hospital in Uttar Pradesh due to unpaid bills.

""The BJP will use this year's Kumbh to the hilt and maximise benefits. It remains to be seen if it succeeds or not since it has failed in fulfilling its basic promises of jobs, education and healthcare,"" said Mukul.",India's mega Kumbh festival gets BJP boost ahead of election,religion and belief,religious belief,1406
235918,hitandrun,"A decade ago, single payer health care—the government-run health care system that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.) refers to as Medicare for All—was a fringe idea in the Democratic Party. President Obama positioned his health care law as an alternative to the notion of a fully government-run system, and the few Democrats in Congress who supported single payer tended to do so softly, believing that most Americans would reject the idea.

When former Sen. Max Baucus (D–Mont.) led negotiations over the legislation that would become the Affordable Care Act, he had one rule: All options would be up for discussion—except for single payer. As Baucus tells Robert Draper of The New York Times in a sharply reported feature on the rise of single payer as a force in Democratic politics, the senator was sympathetic to the idea, but didn't believe America was ready. Given how difficult it was to pass the comparatively less radical plan that became Obamacare, I'd say he was right.

Over the last decade, however, single payer has become a widely held policy preference on the left—what Draper describes as a ""litmus test for progressives,"" with more than a hundred backers in the House, and multiple top-tier supporters in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Medicare for All, Draper writes, has gone mainstream.

Yet in recent weeks, there are also signs that the momentum has slowed, and that some Democrats are retreating—or at least proceeding with caution.

Most prominently, there is Sen. Kamala Harris (D–Calif.), one of the original co-sponsors of Sanders' Medicare for All bill in 2017. After months of backtracking and flip-flopping on whether she supports eliminating most private health insurance, as the Sanders plan calls for, she appears to have fully reversed course, expressing discomfort with the Sanders plan and releasing her own (confused) competing plan.

The party's old guard meanwhile, continues to think Medicare for All is a bad idea, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D–Calif.) repeatedly questioning it, and former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D–Nev.) saying last week that it would be a problem for Democrats to back it in the 2020 election because it couldn't pass. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who represents this wing of the Democratic Party and is the primary field's most prominent critic of Medicare for All, remains at the top of the polls.

Sanders himself, meanwhile, recently modified his plan in response to concerns from unions, suggesting that even Sanders is not completely unmoved by criticism of his plan, at least if it comes from the left.

Meanwhile, it appears that there's little enthusiasm for single payer legislation where it matters—among the Senate Democrats positioned to exert the most influence over any future legislation.

Ezra Klein of Vox recently spoke to a quartet of upper chamber Democrats about their health policy plans. He found that they had ambitious expansions of Obamacare in mind, and no plans to seek Republican votes, assuming that their opponents would oppose any plan Democrats put forward. So these Democrats are feeling ambitious and expansive about health policy and unburdened by the need to compromise with Republicans. Yet even now they remain wary of the sort of full-fledged single payer system called for in Sanders' plan, largely because it would abolish most private coverage:

Which isn't to say Senate Democrats are prepared to abolish private health insurance. As in Wyden's comment, the word ""choices"" came up a lot in my conversations. ""As a practical matter, the way we move forward on health care has to be recognizing people's current insurance system and allowing people to make choices,"" says Stabenow. ""If everyone chose the Medicare public option, then it would be very clear what the public wanted."" ""I understand the aspirational notions around Medicare-for-all, but if there's one thing that I think we still have to wrestle with, it's that Americans want to see more of their fellow citizens covered but they are very nervous about losing what they have,"" says Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA). ""There's a huge risk aversion."" Brown, who has long supported single-payer, agreed. ""I think you want people to have choice still,"" he says. ""You don't want to take people's insurance away. A lot of people don't want government insurance. I understand that.""

Single payer supporters like to argue that the energy is on their side, that the public broadly supports their plans, and that incrementalism has proven disastrous as both politics and policy. And they can point to polls like the one released this morning reporting that about two-thirds of Democratic primary voters are more likely to back a candidate who supports Medicare for All versus one who wants to expand Obamacare.

But while there's certainly truth to the notion that Medicare for All has risen in prominence and popularity, especially among the left, it also seems clear that there are limits to its rise. A separate poll from Monmouth released this week finds that less than one-quarter of Democratic voters want a system that replaces private insurance with a government-run plan—which is exactly what Medicare for All as envisioned by Bernie Sanders would do. And remember: This poll result is limited to self-described Democrats, who are almost certainly more favorable to wiping out private insurance than others.

Even if Democrats somehow managed to win control of the White House and both chambers of Congress—which looks unlikely at this point—it would be a real struggle to pass the sort of radically disruptive plan that Sanders has called for. And it's not just obstructionist Republicans who won't stand for it; it's Democrats themselves. A decade after Obamacare, it seems that Baucus' intuition that most Americans aren't ready for single payer remains correct.

So yes, Medicare for All has gone mainstream, and yes, it will likely remain a prominent part of the Democratic Party's policy vernacular going forward, and worthy of discussion and criticism as a result. But for the foreseeable future, at least, it will probably remain out of reach.",Democrats Are Retreating on Single Payer Health Care,health,healthcare policy,979

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said last week that the refugee issue in northwestern Syria can be resolved after a Russian-Turkish memorandum on creating a demilitarized zone in the Syrian province of Idlib is fully implemented.

During the September 2018 talks in the Russian resort city of Sochi, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, agreed to set up a demilitarized zone in Idlib along the contact line between the armed opposition and government forces.

The northwestern Idlib province is home to scores of various groups, including the Turkey-backed National Front for Liberation and the Jabhat al-Nusra terror group. Around 30,000 militants, including foreign mercenaries, are reportedly operating in the region.

The UN regional humanitarian coordinator for the Syria crisis, Panos Moumtzis, has warned that up to 2 million refugees could flee to Turkey if fighting in northwestern Syria continues.

As the Syrian government has regained control over most of the country's territories that were seized by terrorists, it is now focused on creating favorable conditions for repatriating refugees.

Moscow is assisting Damascus in the process, along with providing humanitarian aid to civilians and being a guarantor of the ceasefire.

7741,aljazeera,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia - Forty years ago on Monday, Vietnamese tanks rolled through Phnom Penh, a city that had been a near ghost town during the Cambodia genocide, to signal the overthrow of the regime of Pol Pot, the ultra-communists' leader who managed to escape in a jeep at the last minute.

It was the end of three years, eight months and 20 days of terror that had resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians.

Large celebrations will take place at the Cambodian capital's Olympic Stadium on Monday to mark ""Victory Over Genocide Day"". Prime Minister Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge commander who defected and helped overthrow them, is expected to deliver a speech lauding January 7 as the moment the country was saved from Pol Pot's murderous clutches.

But while on the surface the overthrow of one of the 20th century's most brutal regimes should be a reason to celebrate, Cambodian politics are not as straightforward.

The invasion had been in response to ruthless cross-border killings by the Khmer Rouge in Vietnam. Vietnamese forces, who were assisted by a far smaller group of former Khmer Rouge defectors, overthrew the Pol Pot regime with relative ease, although the civil war trudged on for another two decades.

But rather than see the day as a liberation, the ruling party's detractors, including Sam Rainsy, the exiled acting leader of the dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), have branded January 7 as the start of an occupation by an historic enemy.

Vietnamese forces did not leave Cambodian soil until 1989 and during that period installed Hun Sen as prime minister, a position he has retained since 1985.

""Whatever they might say in private, the country has virtually no political figure who acts and speaks independently of these two views,"" reads the 2017 paper Moving Beyond The January 7 Narratives by the Future Forum think-tank.

""Even today, Cambodian politicians, from Prime Minister Hun Sen and opposition leader Sam Rainsy on down, spend much of their energy fighting an old civil war which has little relevance to the problems facing most of Cambodia's 15 million people.""

""Without Vietnam, I was about to get killed right away because I was in jail already. At that time I told them I was a student, they put almost everybody in jail,"" Siphan said.

Siphan said Sam Rainsy, who has long taunted Hun Sen with accusations of being a Vietnamese puppet, had no understanding of the importance of January 7 due to not living under the Pol Pot regime.

""Sam Rainsy was living abroad; they never came across the suffering from the killings of the Khmer Rouge. They don't care,"" he said, pointing out that prominent opposition figures allied themselves with the Khmer Rouge in the 1980s.

Meas Nee, a prominent Cambodian political analyst, also has little doubt of his fate had the Vietnamese not invaded.

""My family's name was already on the blacklist to be killed,"" Nee said.

The reason for Nee and his family being targeted was simple. They were deemed ""new people"" and had been placed in a ""re-education village"" near the Vietnamese border due to being educated - a serious red flag in the eyes of the Khmer Rouge.

Nee and his family followed the Vietnamese for around 15km as forces poured across the border, sending the Khmer Rouge scarpering west.

""It was dark ... and later the Vietnamese and the Khmer Rouge passed during the night while we were in the bush. We were sitting, seeing hundreds of Vietnamese army trucks pass by,"" he said.

After a couple of nights hiding in the forest, Nee and his family returned to their village and started the task of rebuilding their lives.

Like many Cambodians, Nee believes the truth of January 7 can be found somewhere between the ""liberation"" and ""occupation"" narratives.

While appreciating the role some in Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party played in overthrowing the Khmer Rouge, many in the country do not look back on the ensuing occupation with fond memories, he pointed out.

""More people decided to escape to the refugee camps in Thailand because they were scared that another communist state would be installed in Cambodia,"" Nee said.

The Vietnamese would have occupied the country for longer than 10 years had it not been down to international pressure, he said.

A notable critic of the Vietnamese occupation was Pen Sovann, who was installed as prime minister of Cambodia by the Vietnamese in 1981 before being removed and jailed for 10 years. He later joined the CNRP in 2012 before passing away four years later.

""January 7 was a victory day but also a sad day [because] Vietnam violated Cambodian autonomy,"" Sovann told The Phnom Penh Post in 2001.

""After January 7, from year to year Vietnamese have put pressure on all kinds of freedom of expression in Cambodia and the fate of Cambodia was decided by Vietnamese.""

Cambodia, including Phnom Penh, has changed beyond recognition from the devastation left in the wake of the Khmer Rouge in 1979.

Terms such as ""stability"" and ""peace"" have long been buzzwords for Hun Sen, who has presented himself as the national saviour and the only true representative of the Cambodian people.

But while there has been considerable economic growth on Hun Sen's watch, many young people have become tired of a lack of opportunities, widespread corruption and continued authoritarianism at the hands of a prime minister who has been accused of overseeing widespread human rights abuses.

The CNRP tapped into this discontent and came within seven seats of a shock victory in the 2013 general election, before making hefty gains in local elections four years later. Then, in what many saw as a cynical move to assure victory in the 2018 general election, the CNRP was outlawed and its president, Kem Sokha, thrown in jail on widely discredited claims he was attempting to wage a revolution.

Sam Rainsy, who has vowed to return to Cambodia despite facing jail on convictions widely thought to be politically charged, said that January 7 was becoming ""more and more controversial in the eyes of the population"".

""It is not like under the communist regime during the Cold War when the only possible reasoning had to be in line with the official propaganda,"" he said.

Sam Rainsy did, however, argue that January 7 rhetoric was losing its appeal with the younger generation.

Sophal Ear, a Cambodian-US professor of diplomacy and world affairs at Occidental College who escaped the Khmer Rouge as a child, agreed with Sam Rainsy, but pointed out that the acting opposition leader had also refused to drop the issue.

""I don't think he's ready to stop exploiting 7 January either as [a] trigger for Vietnam and the Vietnamese,"" Ear said.

But Hun Sen's efforts to paint himself as a national saviour did not make sense for young people who had never known war, genocide or the origins of the ruling party, he added.

""However, I think it's woven into the identity of the party,"" he said.

""Changing the narrative is, I guess, not an option.""",Khmer Rouge fall still dominates Cambodian politics 40 years on,politics,political crisis,1148

Of course this article won’t talk about demanding a “Green New Deal” that would require every homeowner, business, city and state to go to renewable energy. Did they notice that Alaska has 6 months of darkness that makes solar panels worthless? I thought not. First, the mass murder situation.

Embattled Virginia Governor Ralph Northam told reporters, in response to the Kathy Tran legislation on abortion introduced in the legislature, that “If a mother is in labor…the infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians & mother.”

Comforting a child until they die. That’s murder. Period. And with the number of abortions performed each year, that’s mass murder.

The whole abortion issue, now being pushed to the max by Democrats because they’re afraid that Roe v Wade will be overturned, has brought 8 states into the last trimester debate over killing babies all the way to birth. And with Northam’s statement, he apparently is happy with watching a child die after the womb. And that man is a pediatrician.

“Sen. Bernie Sanders presented a plan Thursday to expand estate taxes on the wealthy, including a new 77 percent rate on billionaires’, as he becomes the latest liberal Democrat to advocate a levy on the rich to combat income inequality.

‘The fairest way to reduce wealth inequality, invest in the disappearing middle class and preserve our democracy is to enact a progressive estate tax on the inherited wealth of multi-millionaires and billionaires,’ Sanders tweeted of his proposal.”

Sanders isn’t the only one proposing extreme taxation: Ocasio-Cortez proposed a 70% tax on the rich. Ilhan Omar proposed also a 70%, 80% or 90% tax.

“So there are a few things that we could do. One of them is that we could increase the taxes that people are paying who are the extremely wealthy in our communities. Seventy percent, 80 percent, we’ve had it as high as 90 percent.” Ilhan Omar in an interviewreported by the Tennessee Star.

AOC once said that having billionaires in America is immoral. Did anyone ask me? No. I’m not for taxing the rich at exorbitant rates. That’s stupid. Most of them are the employers of America. Tax them that high and watch jobs disappear and bread lines become a reality.

If you’ve ever had to wait for an appointment to see a surgeon, you would know that the whole “Medicare for All” gig is a loser. When you’re on Medicare, you get to wait sometimes for months to get an appointment (speaking from personal experience). If you remove the private insurance policy and everyone has to wait for a medical appointment, like in Canada and Britain, for example, you’re pardon-the-expression screwed. It takes our state-of-the-art medical system and dumps it into the trash heap of socialized medicine.

Remember: doctors under medicare get significantly less money when they have a Medicare patient. What do you think that will do to our healthcare system?

Kamala Harris even went so far as to suggest that private insurance companies should be dumped in her “Medicare for All” plan. Elizabeth Warren, and Kirsten Gillibrand also promote a total single-payer medical plan.  It’s not about “keep your plan and your doctor if you like them,” it’s about dumping everything and you get the US government only. Not my favorite idea.

Fresh off announcing that as president she would override Congress to get her way on gun policy, the Democratic senator from California and 2020 presidential hopeful said she would use executive power to push for bans on state laws she opposes, too.

Speaking to a Service Employees International Union (SEIU) gathering on Saturday, Harris spoke of the need for ""banning right-to-work laws"" that nearly half of states have enacted and how, as president, she would use both her ""bully pulpit"" and ""executive authority"" to accomplish that.

Right-to-work laws are often framed by Democrats as an anti-worker policy. In fact, all they say is that employees can't be told to join a union or pay union fees as a condition of employment. They're still welcome to do so; they just have to make that choice for themselves.

In the topsy-turvy world of Harris and other Democrats, however, giving workers options is no good. If elite forces in Washington think workers would be better off joining unions, then they're just going to override the will of individual employees and state governments across the country. Do as they say! Or else! For your own good.

Sure, some low-income workers might think their hard-earned dollars are better spent on securing immediate material well-being for them and their families. But Harris thinks their dollars would be better off with a massive and bloated international organization that can help her presidential campaign. I mean, have you seen SEIU's massive mansion across the street from the White House? How could any group so swampy be wrong?

Right to work is a bugbear to union leaders because it crimps their finances for political spending, and Ms. Harris is eager to get the endorsement of the SEIU and other major unions. Her first big policy proposal, unveiled in March, would have the feds give teachers across the country an average pay raise of $13,500 a year. That payoff to the teachers unions would cost federal taxpayers some $315 billion over 10 years, not including what states would have to contribute to qualify for these Harris Grants. The big story of the 2020 campaign so far is the Democratic Party's lurch to the left, and Ms. Harris's pitch against right to work is evidence that her goal is entrenching union power rather than assisting workers.

Several years ago, Reason ran a series of articles on whether libertarians should support right-to-work laws. Here's Shikha Dalmia making that case that yes, ""right to work laws are indeed libertarian."" Meanwhile, contributors Sheldon Richman and J.D. Tuccille make a libertarian case against right-to-work laws, arguing that they interfere with freedom of contract, here and here.

9480,aljazeera,"Madrid, Spain - Spain's Pedro Sanchez is in Strasbourg to speak to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), making him the country's first serving leader to do so.

Sanchez will visit both the ECHR and the Council of Europe on Thursday, where he is expected to ""defend"" the Spanish court system a week before 12 Catalan politicians go on trial.

Spanish media said Sanchez will assure the ECHR that ""individual rights, public liberties and the rights of minorities are guaranteed"" and will stress on Spain's ""respect of jurisprudence"".

The trial of the 12 Catalan leaders is due to begin in Spain's capital Madrid on February 12.

The Catalan separatists have been charged with rebellion, disobedience and embezzlement of public funds during a failed independence bid in 2017 and face up to 25 years in jail.

One of the legal teams representing the jailed Catalan leaders confirmed to Al Jazeera on Thursday that they plan to appeal to the ECHR if the Spanish Supreme Court delivers a guilty verdict.

Critics say Spain's Supreme Court lacks independence and is politically biased against the Catalan leaders.

Indictments against those facing trial say they ignored the ""grave"" risk of violence while holding the October 1 referendum, which met a police crackdown described by rights groups as ""excessive"".

In March last year, Spanish newspaper El Diario wrote that Pablo Llarena, the judge charged with investigating the Catalan referendum case, distorted ""the reality of what occurred in Catalonia to extremes difficult to believe"".

Josep Costa, the first vice president of the Catalonia parliament, told Al Jazeera in an interview that the court's ""impartiality"" regarding the trial must be taken into account.

""It's a very conservative court,"" Costa, who is also a professor of political science at Barcelona's Universitat Pompeu Fabra, said. The judges ""have political ties with the more conservative branch of the judiciary,"" he said.

Spanish conservatives have taken a hardline approach towards Catalan nationalism.

During the push for independence, the government headed by former Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy from the conservative People's Party, refused to speak with Catalan leaders about self-determination, suspended the region's autonomy and called snap elections hoping to depose separatist leaders.

Many Catalans believe the Supreme Court will adopt a similar strategy during the trial: ""They will have the opportunity to show their [judicial] independence which will confirm their conservative approach,"" said Costa.

There is no legal precedent of the trial of the Catalan leaders in Spain's democratic history. This makes the Supreme Court's jurisdiction over the case open to interpretation.

But Ignacio Garcia Vitoria, assistant professor of constitutional law at Madrid's Complutense University, told Al Jazeera that ""there is no basis for a general criticism of the independence of judges in Spain"".

""We are a country completely in agreement with European standards,"" he said.

Among the many concerns critics have is the issue of which court being competent to try the accused.

Apart from its Supreme Court, Spain also has an Audiencia Nacional, a special high court which has jurisdiction over the country as well as on cases of international crimes over which it has authority.

Both courts have held sessions concerning their jurisdiction over the trial of the 12 Catalan leaders, though the proceedings were eventually sent to the Supreme Court.

Lawyers for the Catalans say the Supreme Court trying the criminal case violates fundamental rights, since the court's decision cannot be appealed within Spain and must be taken up with the ECHR.

""We will see how they are resolved and, where appropriate, the decision will be reviewed by the Constitutional Court and by the ECHR,"" Garcia said.",Spanish PM travels to Strasbourg to 'defend' country's judiciary,"crime, law and justice",judiciary,578

, which stand against vision of a powerful independent state seeking to act as one of the centers of power on the global stage.

This is a critical look at the situation in Russia. The video is based on an article of one of our readers and additional data.The Russia of 2019 is in a complicated economic and even political situation.This is manifested in society and in national politics. The approval rating of the Russian government and personally of President Vladimir Putin has been decreasing.According to VCIOM, a state pollster,when it was 57.2%. At the same time, the confidence rating of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was 7.8%. The approval rating of his cabinet is 37.7% while the disapproval rating is 38.7%. Opposition sources show data, which is far worse for the current Russian leadership.This tendency is not linked to the foreign policy course of the Kremlin. Rather,, which look similar to the approaches exercised by the Russian government in the mid-1990s.amid the slowing Russian economy, especially in the industrial sector,were both factors contributing to the further growth of discontent in the population.. However, the Ministry of Economic Development, in its document entitled ""Economic Picture"" stated that this is linked to ""one-time factors"" and is not ""stable"". The ministry maintained its earlier forecast stating that GDP growth in 2019 will be 1.3%. It confirmed increasing capital outflow. In this case, the repayment of funds to Western creditors by the Russian private sector is one of the causes.The Ministry of Economic Development also pointed out that. Statutory charges, including the increased taxes, are named as one of the reasons. The document says that statutory charges grew by 14.8% in 2018.Additionally, the population is facing an increasingly restrictive administrative pressure:. Restrictive traffic management of big cities, increasing fees for using federal highways as well as policies that are de-facto aimed at small business and self-employed persons are among its landmarks.Meanwhile the general population has no effective levers of pressure to affect or correct government policy.. United Russia (Edinaya Rossiya) is the only political party still de-facto existing in public politics. By now its ideological and organizational capabilities have become exhausted.It is hard to find a lawmaker in the State Duma or the Federation Council, who is not affiliated with the cliquish top political elite and oligarch clans.In the media sphere,A vast majority of the initiatives of Medvedev's cabinet face a negative reaction from the population.made the situation even worse. These cases revealed blatant hypocrisy and the neglectful attitude to duties of some Russian officials.Some of the officials even became heroes of nationwide memes. Probably, the most prominent of these heroes are Minister of Labour and Employment of the Saratov region Natalia Sokolova and Head of Department for Youth Policy in the Sverdlov Region Olga Glatskikh.and to thus become able to survive on the subsistence minimum of 3,500 RUB [about 50 USD] per month.""You will become younger, prettier and slimmer! Makaroshki cost is always the same!"", she said during a meeting of the regional parliamentary group on social policy in October 2018 adding that discounted products can be used to create a ""balanced, but dietic"" menu.Glatskikh became a meme hero thank to her meeting with young volunteers during the same month. Commenting on the possible financing of youth projects, she told volunteers that the government did not ask their parents ""to give birth"" to them. So, they should expect nothing from the state.In comparison to previous periods,. The most recent detention took place right in the Parliament building on January 30.

After a large-scale corruption scandal in the Ministry of Defense in 2012, which led to almost no consequences for key responsible persons including former Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov, who even continued his carrier in state-linked corporation Rostec.The aforementioned factors fuel the negative perception of the Medvedev government and Vladimir Putin as the head of state among Russian citizens.The 2014 events inshowed to the Russian population that its state is ready to defend the interests of the nation and those who describe themselves as Russians even by force of arms. This was the first case when this approach was openly employed in the recent history of Russia. Therefore, the population was enthusiastic and national pride was on the rise. However, the Kremlinand did not use them to strengthen the Russian state. In fact, up to February 2019,This can be observed in both the Caucasus and Central Asia. Even, their close ally, Belarus, occasionally demonstrates unfriendly behavior and focuses its own efforts on the exploitation of economic preferences granted by Russia.Evaluating the current internal political situation in Russia and its foreign policy course, it's possible to say that the Russian leadership has lost its clear vision of national development and a firm and consistent policy, which are needed for any great power.This system led to the creation of a leadership, which pursues its own narrow clannish interests. Apparently, all of these factors influence Russian foreign and domestic policies in one way or another.The aforementioned large-scale anti-corruption campaign, regarding the people's show-me attitude towards its result, could be a sign of a new emerging trend, which would lead to a purge of the corrupt elites and to strategic changes in Russian domestic policy.It is highly likely that Russia will face hard times in the next two years (2019-2020) and face various threats and challenges to its economy, foreign policy course and even to its statehood.",Russia slides towards internal political crisis,politics,political crisis,970

Lina Mendoni’s comments Wednesday followed publication in Greek media of photos ostensibly showing damp and mould stains on the hall’s ceiling, which suffered a minor leak during a rainstorm last year.

She said the “picture of neglect” at the London museum “strengthens Greece’s just demand” for the sculptures’ return, which the two-month-old conservative government in Athens has revived, seeking a loan of the works in 2021.

Greece says the marbles were illegally removed from the Parthenon temple on the Acropolis during the Ottoman Turkish occupation of Greece in the early 1800s. The British Museum rejects that.

77980,breitbart,"Five men attacked a group of Christmas carolers in Tamil Nadu last week, including a 17-year-old boy, as part of a spate of pre-Christmas violence against Christians.

Pastor Joshua, who leads a local Christian community in Permuapalayam, Tamil Nadu, had gathered a group of the faithful to celebrate Advent in their home but they were assaulted by the militants as they began singing carols heralding Christ’s birth.

The day after the episode, the Christians went to the police department to file a complaint, but were rejected, according to reports from the Rome-based Fides news agency.

“Episodes of intolerance towards the Christian faith have been increasing in Tamil Nadu in recent years,” said Christian Solidarity Worldwide (CSW), an NGO that monitors the situation of religious minorities in India.

It is “deeply worrying to see that religious holidays are distorted by those who want to plant seeds of contention and discord in India,” CSW stated. “Respecting the right to practice one’s religion is fundamental. We urge the authorities to take appropriate measures against these behaviors and to promote a culture of mutual respect.”

Several days ago, International Christian Concern (ICC) released a report that Christians in India had suffered over a half dozen acts of targeted persecution in the days leading up to Christmas, and many of India’s Christians have been obliged to adjust their Christmas celebrations for fear of reprisals from Hindu radicals.

“We have cancelled all our Christmas events in Banni Mardatti village, including carols, cottage meetings, and pre-Christmas events,” said Pastor Raja Bhovi of His Grace Church in India’s Karnataka State.

“There is a fear of being attacked by Hindu radicals,” he added, referring to recent events.

In early December, a mob of Hindu nationalists attacked and brutally beat members of Rev. Bhovi’s church community as they were clearing a plot of land for the building of a church. Afterward, they cut off the water supply for all 25 Christian families in the village, threatening to drive them out of their homes unless they renounce their faith in Christ.

“We were small in number at the police station compared to the mob of Hindu radicals,” the pastor said. “All of the 25 Christian families were present at the police station to lodge a complaint; however, the police told us that Christians cannot hold any meetings in the village and that pastors from outside the village cannot visit the Christian families, even during this festive season.”

According to some observers, anti-Christian persecution in India has now reached unprecedented levels, especially under the reigning prime minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which promotes Hindu nationalism.

“The level of intolerance we are witnessing in this country today is unprecedented,” said Nehemiah Christie, a local human rights activist. “Christians cannot celebrate the holidays for fear of violence.”

“The police are also complicit and do not take complaints seriously,” Christie noted. “In many cases, suffering remains unheard, violence remains unpunished and people continue to live in fear.”",Christmas Carolers Assaulted in India by Presumed Hindu Radicals,religion and belief,religious event,484
460914,renegadetribune,"Such was the life and the blessing which the Judahites, gathered in the Temple in 621 BC, were exhorted in the name of Jehovah and Moses to choose by their tribal chieftain Josiah, the mouthpiece of the priesthood.

The purpose and meaning of existence, under this “Mosaic Law”, was the destruction and enslavement of others for the sake of plunder and power. Israel might from that moment have counted itself happy to have been pronounced dead and to have been excluded from such a world to come. The Israelites had mingled in the living bloodstream of mankind; on its banks the Judahites were left stranded in the power of a fanatical priesthood which commanded them, on pain of “all these curses”, to destroy.

To the terror inspired by “all these curses” the Levites added also an allurement. In this tenet Deuteronomy most clearly revealed the status allotted to the heathen by The Second Law. In the last analysis, “the heathen” have no legal existence under this Law; how could they have, when Jehovah only “knows” his “holy people”?

Insofar as their actual existence is admitted, it is only for such purposes as those stated in verse 65, chapter 28 and verse 7, chapter 30: namely, to receive the Judahites when they are dispersed for their transgressions and then, when their guests repent and are forgiven, to inherit curses lifted from the regenerate Judahites.

True, the second verse quoted gives the pretext that “all these curses” will be transferred to the heathen because they “hated” and “persecuted” the judahites, but how could they be held culpable of this when the very presence of the Judahites among them was merely the result of punitive “curses” inflicted by Jehovah? For Jehovah himself, according to another verse (64, chapter 28) took credit for putting the curse of exile on the Judahites:

Deuteronomy employs this Doublespeak (to use the modem idiom) throughout: the Lord makes the special people homeless among the heathen for their transgressions; the heathen, who have no blame either for their exile or for those transgressions, are their “persecutors “; ergo, the heathen will be destroyed.

The Judaist attitude towards other mankind, creation, and the universe in general, is better understood when these and related passages have been pondered, and especially the constant plaint that Jews are “persecuted” everywhere, which in one tone or another runs through nearly all Jewish literature. To any who accept this book as The Law, the mere existence of others is in fact persecution; Deuteronomy plainly implies that.

The most nationalist Jew and the most enlightened Jew often agree in one thing: they cannot truly consider the world and its affairs from any but a Jewish angle, and from that angle “the stranger” seems insignificant. Thinking makes it so, and this is the legacy of twenty-five centuries of Jewish thinking; even those Jews who see the heresy or fallacy cannot always divest themselves entirely of the incubus on their minds and spirits.

The passage from Deuteronomy last quoted shows that the ruling sect depicted homelessness at one and the same time as the act of the special people’s god and as persecution by the special people’s enemies, deserving of “all these curses”. To minds of such extreme egotism a political outrage in which 95 Gentiles and 5 Jews lose their lives or property is simply an anti-Jewish disaster, and they are not consciously hypocritical in this.

In the Twentieth Century this standard of judgment has been projected into the lives of other peoples and applied to all major events in the ordeal of the West. Thus we live in the century of the Levitical fallacy.

Having undertaken to put “all these curses” on innocent parties, if the Judahites would return to observance of “all these statutes and judgments”, the resurrected Moses of Deuteronomy promised one more blessing (“The Lord thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them… “) and then was allowed to die in the land of Moab.",Jews Have a Religion of Being “Persecuted” Everywhere,religion and belief,religious text,650

Everyone at this gathering in Yerevan is young, hip and determined, and they're learning how to stage a revolution. RT Russian managed to get inside the protesters' camp, funded by US cash, and see what is being taught.And it's no coincidence Armenia was chosen to host the camp. After large-scale protests forced Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan to resign, protesters from all over the Commonwealth of Independent States started flocking to Yerevan for more inspiration.A total of 150 people participated in the forum; most were sponsored by the organizers from Prague. Local participants were hailed as heroes, and visiting young men and women from other ex-Soviet republics got their own injection of inspiration from their triumph. If Armenia could, they can, too.The focus in CampCamp is on new technologies, on all things young and hip.""Fighting the authorities must be the cool thing to do, it must be trendy,"" teaches Nikolay Artyomenko, head of the opposition Vremya (Time) movement from St. Petersburg.His portfolio is quite impressive. He put up banners on St. Isaac's Cathedral protesting against the Orthodox Church taking over the museum. He ran a copy of the country's constitution through a shredder, Banksy style, co-organized anti-corruption protests with rubber ducks; distributed ""Dictator"" prints where Putin was depicted like Obama in his ""Hope"" posters.Nikolay teaches others to be creative and invent new ways to protest that should take over the old-school crowd with picket signs format.""You have to stretch your imagination; there's quite a problem on the protesting market these days. Protesting has become very expensive"", he shares. But Zhenya, an activist from Siberia, knows how to cut costs.He just turned 18, yet he has already risen to stardom on the activist scene: his one-man protests have made front-page headlines in his city more than once. Each of Zhenya's demonstrations is like a theatrical performance. He carefully selects props and plans according to the country's Administrative Penal Code: ""You have to make sure you violate different laws to avoid being double-fined.""He's locked in a long debate with Sasha from St. Petersburg about what kind of a public protest will get the smallest fine, and how to cut the ""expenses"". Sasha is the more experienced of the two: he is already a law student and knows how to protest with minimal charges.The CampCamp 2018's most active group is the one from Kyrgyzstan. It's a crowd of young journalists led by Bektour Iskender, founder of opposition web portal Кloop.kg.Bektour sees no harm that this ""festival of democracy"" is sponsored by foreign money. During the break, he confirms that his project is financed by the Prague Civil Society Centre.""They treat me as an equal. They don't try to be my boss, and I'm good with it"", he says.Step number two: think of a solution to the problem you've indicated using something you enjoy doing. Zhenya from Siberia and Boris from Dushanbe spend the next 15 minutes thinking of how they can overthrow the government while ""sky gazing in the trees."" Sounds downright comical, but the guys admit freely that they don't mind using falsification and manipulation for the right cause, if necessary.Artist Dasha Sozanovich goes on to explain in her workshop how to use cool visuals for protest purposes.""Pictures work for both good and evil,"" she says. ""The Islamic State's (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) visual campaign is an example of how pictures served evil.""Dasha's own project called ""Khabarstan"" is, on the other hand, an example of how pictures serve the ""good guys."" Her presentation makes Kazakhstan funding state TV channels much more exciting. Dasha points out that it was the Prague Civil Society Centre that united all those who collaborated on this project.Two young artists are working away on their whiteboards creating stylish animations of the presentations they see, instead of taking notes the traditional way. That looks very cool, too.""I decided to be an activist 11 years ago. It all started at a police station."" That's a comic strip, where one of the artists captured the essence of what another star of the Armenian Revolution David Sansaryan was saying.One more piece of advice young activists get here is that they should focus on social media, like Russian social networks OK.ru and VK.ru, as well as Facebook, since they can't really compete with real media. The main goal is to elicit a response, get people to repost and comment on their publications.""It's like something out of this world for us,"" says a girl from Kazakhstan.There are also young people from Russia and Belarus here, ""dreaming to repeat Yerevan's success."" Vanya from Perm confesses to the supportive audience that he came here to ""export the revolution."" That's exactly what our ""friends"" from Prague, Europe's partisans of democracy are going to be teaching them all four days of the forum. However, the excitement he created gets killed by a word of reason from head organizer Maria Sereda. She reminds all those present about security and requests them to refrain from tweeting this catchy slogan, ""or we'll have Russian cameras all over the place in no time.""The forum also offers a handful of workshops on techniques that can be used to increase protest sentiment in society. One workshop uses the theme of Russian folk tales. In one of the cases, a ""forest community"" learns to interact with the government, i.e. the ""Big Bad Wolf."" Speaking of overthrowing the ""Big Bad Wolf of Belarus,"" the head organizer says that there is only one to do it - to let the little critters' anger grow over the years.""You'll have to let the little critters' anger grow till you impeach the Big Bad Wolf,"" Maria Sereda says cheerfully. ""This case will work great for Belarus. And it has already worked for Ukraine!""""They work quietly and softy"", Ms Sereda says.

223670,freedombunker,"Outrage was the general researcher and media response to the Chinese bioengineer He Jiankui's announcement last November that he had used CRISPR gene-editing technology to modify the genomes of several human embryos with the goal of making them resistant to HIV infection. The result was the birth of twin girls; one with the genetic modification in all of her body's cells and another whose body is a mosaic of modified and unmodified cells. He did certainly cut both scientific and ethical corners in applying CRISPR technology to human embryos. Happily, a preliminary study in June that suggested the He's modifications might shorten the twins' lifespans appears to be wrong.

Setting aside He's moral shortcomings, is it ever ethical to use CRISPR and other gene-editing technologies to modify the genomes of human embryos? Yes, argues Abertay University bioethicist Kevin Smith in the journal Bioethics. Smith addresses the question using a rigorously applied utilitarian ethics approach. He details recent advances in CRISPR gene-editing safety and concludes that the benefits of preventing heritable diseases already outweigh the risks of using the technology.

In his article, Smith deals with ""several well‐rehearsed positions and arguments"" against permitting parents to use CRISPR gene-editing to fix genetic flaws in their prospective offspring. These include ""claims of unnaturalness, the alleged interests of embryos, questions of identity, fears of eugenics, and simply the 'yuck factor.'"" Smith points out that critics once denounced in vitro fertilization (IVF) on the grounds of that it was ""unnatural."" Millions of parents have freely chosen unnatural IVF techniques to overcome their natural infertility. Some 8 million children have been born via assisted reproduction since the first IVF baby was born in 1979.

Some opponents argue using CRISPR would be unethical because embryos can't give their consent to being genetically modified. A requirement for prenatal consent is obvious ethical nonsense. No one has ever given their consent to be born much less to be born the specific complement of genes they bear. In addition, it's hard to imagine that a child will later feel morally aggrieved that his or her parents had prevented them from suffering a debilitating genetic disease. Providing parents with the ability to choose to prevent heritable disease and disability in their progeny using biotechnology is not to be equated with morally pernicious state-imposed eugenics. And lots of biomedical treatments and reproductive technologies have gone from yuck to yippee as their significant benefits became evident. CRISPR gene-editing will do the same.

Smith persuasively argues that not only would the early application of the technology improve the welfare of prospective parents and their progeny now, it will usher in a human germline genetic modification (HGGM) revolution that will greatly benefit future generations. As Smith explains, ""The longer we wait until commencing the HGGM revolution and moving towards a world of increased utility, the greater will be the quantity of suffering accrued meantime through genetically influenced disease.""

When should CRISPR and even better gene-editing technologies be made available to parents seeking to prevent genetic diseases in their offspring? Given that some folks are still spooked by He's announcement last November, Smith prudentially suggests that ""we kickstart the next biomedical revolution by proceeding not immediately but within around 1–2 years to intervene in the human germline.""

The revolution, however, may start sooner than that.

There are two winners in each category: a reader homeowner and a professional, whether architect, interior designer or key influencer.

The expert judges set about their task at Sketch London restaurant in Conduit Street, Mayfair. Here are the two gardens they chose.

Freelance editor Jeroen moved into a Georgian maisonette in Hackney in 2012, where the big garden was good for Atticus, his Welsh terrier.

Jeroen dug out the skinny borders and replaced a shady bed at the back with a shed-cum-office. It took several years to create his “magical private space.”

First came Pinterest boards, consultations with friends and many sessions of Gardeners’ Question Time on the radio. He visited Vita Sackville-West’s white garden at Sissinghurst, with a return visit last year. Three established trees — a cherry and two viburnums — remained in place and a climbing rose was moved to a sunny spot from a dark corner. Fatsia japonica and magnolia trees were planted in 2013, and the rest of the garden in 2015. Thanks to Atticus, the re-turfed lawn became a “muddy mess”. So now the grass is artificial.

Sourcing: garden table, benches and mirrors found on eBay; Farrow & Ball paints in Off Black and Studio Green; artificial grass from Easigrass.

What the judges said: “Romantic and dreamy”; “A mini Sissinghurst”; “Inspired planting.”

Jeroen's tips: “Keep walls/fences dark to show off plants. Drifts of single plants work better than a jumble. Stick to a few materials for garden furniture. Mine are teak and galvanised metal.”

“I wanted for another room, but out of doors,” says Theresa Gromski, who lives in an Edwardian three-storey terrace house. She has turned her patio into a welcoming space, whether for reading solo or having a party.

Theresa is an influencer and freelance illustrator with nearly 50,000 followers on Instagram. “I wanted a lot of pattern and textiles, cosy cushions and throws,” she adds. Underfoot, concrete was replaced with porcelain slabs and outdoor rugs. With the help of husband Tom, she built seating out of reclaimed scaffold boards.

Extra touches include lanterns, strings of lights and an outdoor umbrella, while plants include bamboo and black bamboo, exotic grasses, heucheras and ferns.

Sourcing: Arizona bistro garden chairs and side table gifted by George Home; fire pit gifted by VonHaus; square black planters gifted by Get Potted; large arched outdoor mirror gifted by Cox & Cox; seat cushions, Madam Stoltz; outdoor rugs, La Redoute and Ikea; solar lights, Wilko.

What the judges said: “I want to go in and sit down — so pretty and welcoming”; “Original use of railway sleepers.”

Theresa’s tips: “Paint fences black to show off your furniture and textiles. Have a handy storage box to stow cushions away when it rains. For tropical vibes go for greenery rather than flowers, and mix vintage and modern planters.”

The prizes were luxury hotel-style bed linen from Tielle Love Luxury, worth £550; a sleek Bose Home Speaker 500, worth £400, and a £50 voucher to spend in the Lecture Room and Library, Sketch London’s luxurious two Michelin-star dining room.

In answering questions about how his for-profit health insurance company was fighting the popular Medicare for All movement, Nelson hinted at crafting carefully strategized backroom dealings while brewing a broad propaganda blitzkrieg.

""One of the things you said: ‘We're really quiet' or ‘It seems like we're quiet.' Um, we've done a lot more than you would think,"" Nelson asserted in response to an employee's question about the company's role regarding Medicare for All, according to a leaked video, mentioned by the Washington Post but not published.

""You want to be kind of thoughtful about how you show up and have these kind of conversations, because the last thing you want to do is become the poster child during the presidential campaign,"" Nelson warned, cited by Washpost.com.

In addition, Nelson declared that UnitedHealthcare ""opposes Medicare for All because it excludes the private sector, which he said does a better job of delivering healthcare than the government, and said he doubted how a single-payer system could be funded or effectively administered.""

The CEO's comments were leaked just a few days after Vermont Senator and 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders (I-VT) revealed a new Medicare for All healthcare bill, which will extend US healthcare benefits to everyone, including undocumented migrants, Sputnik reported Saturday.

The bill, introduced by Sanders last week, did not reference immigrants directly, but clearly stated it would cover all US ""residents."" The bill has received the support of Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

The bill is intended to be a major step beyond the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare), which limits its effect to those who are US citizens, nationals and ""lawfully present immigrants.""

Following the introduction of his bill, Sanders criticized insurance and pharmaceutical companies.

""In my view, the current debate over Medicare for All really has nothing to do with healthcare. It's all about greed and profiteering,"" Sanders said in a recent statement.

""It is about whether we maintain a dysfunctional system which allows the top five health insurance companies to make over $20 billion in profits last year,"" he pointed out.

On Friday, Sanders addressed Nelson and UnitedHealthcare in a Twitter message, writing: ""Our message to Steve Nelson and UnitedHealthcare is simple: When we are in the White House your greed is going to end. We will end the disgrace of millions of people being denied health care while a single company earns $226 billion and its CEO makes $7.5 million in compensation.""

​In a recent statement to the Washington Post, Medicare for All campaigner Tim Faust noted, ""When the people begin organizing against private insurance, the lonely insurance executives turn to their only friends: the elected officials beholden to their cash.""

Medicare for All, a ‘single-payer' plan, envisages the US government paying for any and all expenses related to the physical health and wellbeing of its citizens, similar to most every other developed nation in the world.

By eliminating every other money-moving, for-profit or bureaucratic entity from the current US healthcare system, including insurance companies as well as federal and state branches, Medicare-for-All would provide all the necessary baseline healthcare needs for every US citizen, at no charge to the patient.

Medicare-for-All would eliminate the need for the thousands of publicly-traded and extremely-profitable private-insurance companies that have managed to insinuate themselves between patients and actual healthcare providers, including doctors, clinics and hospitals, according to Washpost.com.

Notably, 17 developed nations including Norway, Japan, the United Kingdom, Kuwait, Sweden, Bahrain, Brunei, Canada, United Arab Emirates, Finland, Slovenia, Italy, Portugal, Cyprus, Spain and Iceland have successfully established single-payer systems.",Know Your Enemy: US Health Insurers Lead Fight Against Universal Healthcare,health,healthcare policy,578

At third-level, however, science is a very broad term, and refers as much to a way of thinking - the scientific method of testing and proving ideas about the universe and everything in it - as to any particular subjects.

Zoology, geology, pharmacology, genetics, nanotechnology and astronomy are among the other science subjects available in college. Meanwhile, maths, psychology and even philosophy are among the disciplines that use a scientific method.

Some colleges and universities offer broad, general entry science courses, with students taking a wide range of subjects in first year before going on to specialise down the line; these include DIT, UCD, WIT, NUI Galway and Maynooth University.

Others, including UCC and UL, have opted to retain more specialised entry routes while, last year, Trinity College moved to introduce four distinct entry routes: biological and biomedical sciences, chemical sciences, geography and geoscience and physical sciences.

CIT has a mix of science entry, while DCU students undertake a common-entry science route before choosing from one of eight degree courses, including biotechnology, physics & astronomy, applied physics, and genetics & cell biology.

Employers across all sectors value science graduates because they are highly-trained critical thinkers and creative problem-solvers. They’re needed to work on clinical trials, research and development, regulation, particularly in biopharmaceuticals, microbiology, product development, food policy, business and the civil service.

Of course, some will go straight into research, whether in academia or the private sector, but most science graduates don’t work in labs and wear white coats, and they’re particularly sought after by finance and tech firms.

The last recession saw received tradition turn on its head, as students abandoned once-popular arts courses and chose science, technology, engineering and maths courses instead.

This has led to points rising over the past decade, although they have stayed relatively steady or even declined slightly over the past two years.

Trinity’s biomedical science and physical sciences courses both required 509 points, UCD’s general entry science courses stood at 505, NUI Galway required 401 points and Maynooth University applicants needed 350.

A recent Higher Education Authority survey found that 64 per cent of science graduates were in employment or about to start a job within nine months of graduation, with a further 28 per cent in postgraduate education or further training, while graduates could expect to be on €32,070 within nine months of getting their degree.",Why Science?

3315,abcnews,"NEW YORK -- A former model who accused Harvey Weinstein last year of sexually abusing her when she was 16 years old filed a new lawsuit against him Thursday, saying she didn't want to be included in a proposed global settlement that would split $25 million among various accusers.

Kaja Sokola, who previously made the allegations in an class-action lawsuit that identified her as Jane Doe, said the proposed settlement was not “fair or just."" She said it lacked accountability for Weinstein and his alleged enablers and provided insufficient compensation for his accusers.

Sokola is suing Weinstein under New York's Child Victims Act, which gives people a one-year window to sue over sexually abuse they say they endured as children, sometimes decades ago. Her lawyers say it is the first lawsuit filed against Weinstein under the law.

Sokola alleges Weinstein assaulted her at his Manhattan apartment in 2002, just days after they’d met at an event involving her modeling agency. She says Weinstein promised to take her to lunch to discuss her career, but instead took her to his empty SoHo apartment and “aggressively and threateningly” demanded sex.

In the lawsuit, Sokola alleges that Weinstein instructed her to take off her clothes, boasted about having “made” the careers of a pair of Oscar-winning actresses, and intimated she’d never work as an actress unless she gave in to his demands.

“Terrified and struggling to hold back tears, Sokola said she did not want to do anything further and resisted his demands,"" the lawsuit states. “Sokola had no intention or understanding when she agreed to a business lunch that she would be put in this position.""

Sokola says Weinstein's demeanor “became intense, as if he was hunting prey,” and that he made her touch his penis while he touched her genitals and grabbed at her breasts.

The lawsuit also alleges Weinstein's brother and various movie studio executives were aware of his behavior and failed to stop him.

Messages seeking comment were left with lawyers for Robert Weinstein and a representative for Disney, which bought their Miramax film studio in 1993.

The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission, which Sokola has done.

Dozens of women have accused Harvey Weinstein of wrongdoing.

He is scheduled to stand trial Jan. 6 on charges he raped a woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and performed a forcible sex act on a different woman in 2006.

He has pleaded not guilty and maintains that any sexual activity was consensual.

Sokola's lawsuit includes only part of the allegations she detailed as Jane Doe in October 2018.

In that court filing, she also accused Weinstein of subjecting her to years of harassment and emotional abuse and said he blocked her from a successful acting career as payback for refusing his advances.

Sokola, now a clinical psychologist and psychotherapist in her native Poland, says in the lawsuit filed Thursday that she felt angry at Weinstein during the encounter and ashamed that he was causing her to unwillingly engage in sex acts.

“Weinstein made clear that refusing his sexual demands would mean giving up the opportunity to make it in Hollywood,"" the lawsuit says. “As Harvey Weinstein finally let Sokola leave, he told her that she needed to work on her stubbornness.""","Ex-model sues Weinstein, renewing allegations of abuse at 16","crime, law and justice",law,540
650479,thedailyrecord,"A popular Wishaw teacher has retired after battling back to work following a cancer scare.

Calderbridge Primary teacher Ann Haig said goodbye to the school after 40 years on Friday along with colleagues Heather Holland and June Mann.

Mrs Haig was diagnosed with breast cancer last March but returned to the school earlier this year.

She said: “I could have retired last summer but I didn’t want to go out while I was off sick.

“I wanted to prove to myself that I could come back and teach.

“I finished the term up to last summer and I had my treatment up until November but I was always popping into the school.

“I am cancer free at the moment but I will still be going back to get checked out until 2021.”

The pupils and staff at Calderbridge decided to raise money in aid of Cancer Research UK after learning about how the charity helped Mrs Haig throughout her cancer battle.

A Race for Life event was held with staff, pupils and parents all taking part raising more than £6,000 for the charity.

Calderbridge class teacher Jacqueline Wilson is also part of the school’s sports committee who organised the Race For Life.

She said: “It’s a fantastic achievement to raise such a huge amount. The school’s nursery class alone raised over £1,000.

“The children, staff and parents were all part of it. We were shocked when we totalled the money and found we had such a large amount of money to hand over to the charity.

“Mrs Haig spoke to the pupils at an assembly about how the charity and her own battle with cancer .

“I think it really struck a cord with all the pupils.”

Mrs Haig added: “I was really touched when they thought of me when they decided to do the Race For Life.

“I’m a glass half full kind of person. That’s who I am.

574452,tass,"ARKHANGELSK, December 2. /TASS/. Specialists of the Russian Arctic Nature Park jointly with the Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Geography began the Clean Arctic project to analyze the effect of oil products’ pollution on soils, vegetation and the ecosystem’s other components on the Franz Josef Land Archipelago. The project will continue for three years, the national park’s Director Alexander Kirilov told TASS.

""We’ve begun the Clean Arctic project on Franz Josef Land, which will continue for three years,"" he said. ""Scientists will analyze distribution of oil products in the seasonal melt layer in the Arctic.""

""Researchers will see how much oil products affect components of the ecosystem in high latitudes,"" he continued. ""The results will be applied to plan further revegetation of those territories.""

Cleaning effort on Franz Josef Land has been underway since 2012, and between 2012 and 2017 more than 45,000 tonnes of waste was removed from the archipelago. Cleaning works have been practically finalized on the Alexandra Land, the Hooker, Heiss and Graham Bell Islands, and cleaning work should yet be carried out on the Rudolf and Hofmann Islands.

""Polluted areas still remain in places, where fuel used to be stored <...> and thus quite many oil products still remain in the soil,"" the Clean Arctic project’s leader, geologist Dmitry Kryukov noted.

As part of the project, specialists will take soil samples and compare them with ""clean"" areas. ""Thus, the studies will let us see how the environment may change under the effect of such pollutants,"" Alexander Dobryansky of the Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Geography commented. The first samples have been taken on the Alexandra Land.

Conditions on the islands, where the cleaning took place, are different, and thus specialists used different methods to revegetate the soils. The studies will also show how effective the chosen methods were and what impact they have on the ecosystem.

Results of the studies on the Arctic islands will serve as an input into remote analysis of pollution, including by radar imaging. It is very hard to receive good pictures of the high-latitudinal Arctic from satellites as the territory practically always is under layers of clouds, the expert said.

""When we study the territory, we are gaining references in order to use space imaging to decipher the objects we need: pollution and structure of landscapes,"" he explained. ""But in order to use radar imaging, which works regardless of clouds, we need to have a database of spectral images in different shooting ranges.""

""Sets of references and comparison with how objects are represented in optical images will be used to develop a method of decoding radar imaging for the high-Arctic conditions,"" he added.

This method could be employed both on Franz Josef Land’s islands and on other islands as well as on the mainland with similar conditions: for example, on Novaya Zemlya and Severnaya Zemlya archipelagoes.

""The technologies could be used practically along the entire northern shore of continental Russia,"" Dobryansky pointed out. ""In the Lena’s estuary in Yakutia, for example, there is still lots of environmental damage. The work there is supported financially by the Rosneft company.""

The Russian Arctic National Park is Russia’s northernmost and biggest nature reserve, which covers an area of 8.8 million hectares. It was established on June 15, 2009.

The Bennington Banner reports Democratic Sen. Brian Campion wants to avoid the toxic chemical contamination that was found when two former factories in Bennington closed in 2002.

Campion and Sen. Dick Sears say in an email that the battery factory is working with the state’s Agency of Natural Resources on its closure plan and keeping the process “public and transparent.”

The state’s Department of Environmental Conservation's Waste Management and Prevention Division says the notice of the facility’s closure is the first step in a comprehensive closure process.

The next step will be the development of closure plan to be reviewed by environmental officials and carried out 90 days prior to the plant shutdown.

290494,lifesitenews,"WIMBLEDON, UK, December 4, 2019 (LifeSiteNews) – A London Catholic parish allowed a Hindu group to hold a “Diwali” pagan festival in its parish hall next to the church. The local archbishop defended the decision after a parishioner complained, but has also decided to review policy after LifeSiteNews reached out for comment.

On October 12, Sacred Heart Church in Wimbledon hosted the “Diwali Mela” festival which was put on by a group that aims to “promote and encourage” Indian culture. Diwali, called a “festival of lights,” is the most important Hindu religious festival of the year. Key rituals generally include lighting candles and often include worshipping Hindu pagan deities including Lakshmi (goddess of prosperity) and Lord Ganesha (god of intelligence). The Hindu religion holds itself to be the universal religion for the whole world.

Promotional material for the festival in the Catholic parish hall included colorful pictures of Hindu deities and children dressed up as Hindu deities to act out Hindu myths.

A member of the Catholic parish contacted the archbishop of Southwark, John Wilson, one month prior to the event to express concern about the event. In an email obtained by LifeSiteNews, the parishioner wrote: “Ecumenism, dialogue and hospitality notwithstanding, I can’t see how hosting a pagan festival on Church property is not contrary to the First Commandment.” The first of the Ten Commandments given by God to Moses in the Old Testament states: “I am the Lord thy God. Thou shalt have no other gods before me.” The author of Psalms points out that “all the gods of the pagans are demons” (Psalm 95.5).

“If we ourselves have not faith in Christ and manifest our indifference to paganism by hosting this festival, then we should expect Mass attendance to decline in our country,” the parishioner added.

Archbishop Wilson, responding to the parishioner a week and a half later, indicated that he was satisfied that the event was “cultural” and not “religious” and pointed the parishioner to Church documents about “interreligious dialogue.”

In an email obtained by LifeSiteNews, the archbishop stated: “I have contacted the Parish Priest, Canon John Clark, who offered the following response after seeking clarification from the Hall Secretary: ‘The Mela is a purely cultural event open to all who would like to come along. This is the third Mela and all have been held here without any problems. We have approached the organising committee of the Mela and they have confirmed that it is a cultural not a religious event. They have made a summary of the programme for the day and none of it has a religious element. I enclose a copy of their response for your benefit. As far as I know their Mela is not operated by a commercial company. We have a number of contacts with the Hindu community as they often hold their wedding receptions and birthday parties here.’”

The archbishop continued: “Canon Clark also forwarded to me the response of the person organising the event: ‘Thank you for the call, I am attaching the poster for the event. It’s open to all and is organised for all. Mainly kids’ activities, food stalls and merchandise stalls. Kids’ activities include but not restricted to face painting, henna, and such. Food stalls for a feast of Indian food and non-alcoholic drinks. Merchandise stalls like decorative things for around the house or clothes. There’s no religious programme or activity intended. Actually an afternoon with family to enjoy with kids having fun and eating good food!’”

Archbishop Wilson concluded his letter, stating: “We must always be faithful to Christ and the teaching of His Holy Catholic Church.”

He added: “Alongside this, we must also pursue genuine friendship and dialogue with people of other religious traditions, in the service of the common good, as enunciated in the teaching of the Church and by St John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis.”

LifeSiteNews reached out to Archbishop Wilson asking if allowing a pagan religious festival on Church property undermines the Church’s claim that she alone offers the true religion and provides the only path to the Kingdom of God by means of her carrying on the work of Jesus.

The Church is committed to proclaiming the fullness of the Catholic Faith in Christ as the Saviour of the world. If I didn’t believe this I would not belong to the Church, nor spend my life trying to be a witness to Christ so that others might also know, love and serve Him. This is not mutually exclusive with seeking to sustain good and friendly relationships with people of different cultures and religions. This sense is expressed in the annual messages for Divali [sic] by the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue and the Bishops Conference of India. Indeed, it is often with people of other religious traditions that we find common voice in defending the values of human life and the family. In this particular situation, there appears to be a disagreement between the organisers of the event, who have hired the hall for the past three years without incident, and the person who raised a complaint this year. There also seems to be a difference concerning the understanding of what is cultural and what is solely and explicitly religious. When I sought clarification from the organisers of this event, I was told: “It’s open to all and is organised for all. Mainly kids’ activities, food stalls and merchandise stalls. Kids’ activities include but not restricted to face painting, henna, and such. Food stalls for a fast of Indian food and non-alcoholic drinks Merchandise stalls like decorative things for around the house or clothes. There’s no religious programme or activity intended. Actually an afternoon with family to enjoy with kids having fun and eating good food!” It was explained that it is called a Diwali Mela, a festival in the sense of a ‘fair,’ rather than an explicit religious celebration. The church hall is available for social and community use and there was not, and should not, be any compromise of any Church property consecrated for divine worship.

LifeSiteNews then asked how the Archbishop would respond to Catholics in the parish and in his diocese who are scandalized by the decision to allow this pagan festival to take place on Church property. He replied:

I have received one formal complaint from a parishioner about the hire of the church hall at Sacred Heart Parish in Wimbledon for a Divali [sic] fair and I am obviously sorry if anyone feels scandalised by this. In this context, the Catholic Church has a profound witness to give in our diverse society. First, to the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and the beauty of the Catholic Faith. Second, secure in our identity and mission, to the importance of interfaith friendship, without compromising any truths of that Faith. I want all the parishes in our Diocese to be evangelising communities. I think we do this by positively proposing the truth we hold dear in a way that is respectful and engaging. As Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI reminded us, the Church grows by ‘attraction,’ ‘just as Christ draws all to himself by the power of his love.’ We are currently reviewing the documentation used for the hire of non-consecrated Church property.

The “Diwali Mela” festival, which ran on October 12 as scheduled, is hosted by a group called the “Social Spark Hub.” The group states on its website that it was founded in 2015 to “promote and encourage the Indian Culture” with the primary goal to “help children learn about different customs, religious and cultural beliefs.” This year, the group became part of the “Kailash Narain Mehrotra Foundation,” a registered UK charity. The Foundation states that its charitable object is to “advance religious harmony” specifically by “spreading Sanatan culture and Sanatan religious scriptures” and “encouraging observance and celebration of Hindu festivals.” “Sanatan” is another word for the Hindu belief system. Both ""Social Spark Hub"" and the “Kailash Narain Mehrotra Foundation” list the same contact phone number on the UK’s Charity Commission website.

Advisor to Archbishop: Hindu deities are ‘just manifestations of the divine’

The parishioner went on to respond to the archbishop’s original email, providing evidence from social media posts by “Social Spark Hub” that the group does, in fact, include a religious dimension to the “Diwali” event, including putting on a play at a previous festival in the same location called a “Ramleela"", this particular one depicting the Hindu god Ram's life. The parishioner noted that “Ramleelas” are considered by Hindus to be a religious event in the same way that Christians would consider a Nativity or Passion play to be a religious event.

The parishioner wrote to the archbishop: “We should love the sinner but hate the sin. Hindus violate the First Commandment with their pagan worship, but they are not culpable, because they do not know Christ. We do know Christ, so we are without excuse. We should of course treat all Hindus with the utmost Christian Charity, but this does not mean allowing them to use the Sacred Heart Parish Hall to celebrate Diwali. It cannot be compared with holding a birthday party in the hall.”

The following day, the parishioner unexpectedly received an email from Deacon Jon Dal Din, who appears to have a special role within the archdiocese as advisor on interreligious dialogue. Deacon Dal Din was listed in 2015 as “Director of Westminster’s Interfaith agency.” The email, intended for Archbishop Wilson, appears to have been accidentally sent to the parishioner. The Deacon appears to be responding to the Archbishop’s request for guidance on how to deal with the parishioner’s concerns.

In an email obtained by LifeSiteNews, the deacon told the archbishop: “I think you have far more important things to do than waste time responding to these letters.”

“My understanding of a [Diwali] Mela is that it is an Indian cultural event and celebration, although there may be a religious element involved, in the same way that many people celebrate Chinese New Year and people of all faiths and cultures celebrate Christmas,” the deacon wrote.

“It is interesting how [the parishioner] has highlighted selected texts from the Hindu group and not others. I doubt [the parishioner] read the texts you attached. [The parishioner] quotes Pope Benedict. I fear [the parishioner] has a narrow view of mission, evangelisation, proclamation and dialogue. All must be done in a spirit of Love. Jesus’ new Commandment,” he added.

Deacon Dal Din in his email went on to quote at length a talk Pope Francis gave during his September 2019 visit to Africa where he answered questions about evangelisation and proselytism. During his talk, the Pope said he felt “bitterness” when he was introduced to Catholics who had converted from other religions.

Deacon Dal Din said, “[The parishioner] continues to call Hindus pagans. Well perhaps they are, from [the parishioner’s] perspective, because they are not Christians. [The parishioner] would probably feel the same if Sacred Heart were to offer Iftar to the Muslim community during Ramadan. [The parishioner] does not realise that Hindus believe in one God. Their deities are just manifestations of the divine, as indeed, all humans and creation itself are manifestations of the divine.”

“Allowing Hindus to celebrate Diwali Mela in the Church Hall is part of Dialogue of Life, being a good neighbour. Jesus did not mix only with the virtuous, but with sinners and outcasts. Like Pope Francis he reached out to the poor and those on the peripheries,” he stated later in the email to the archbishop.

Archbishop Wilson’s decision to allow the Hindu festival to run on Church property comes at a time when many Church leaders, including Pope Francis, have signaled that the Catholic Church may not contain the fullness of God’s revelation and may not be the only sure path established by God to reach the Kingdom of Heaven.

In February of this year, the Pope claimed in a joint statement with a Grand Imam that a “pluralism and diversity” of religions is “willed by God.” Despite backlash from concerned Catholics around the world, which included criticism from priests, bishops, and cardinals, the Pope has not recanted this statement. The Pope also alarmed Catholics around the world when he participated in events surrounding the recently concluded Amazon Synod in Rome that included the worship of the pagan idol ""Pachamama.""",UK bishop allows pagan Hindu festival to be celebrated on Catholic church grounds,religion and belief,religious text,2034
531,21stcenturywire,"Earlier this year, Norway was hosting multiple rounds of talks between Venezuela’s actual government, and the US-backed opposition, which posits a future situation in which they will end up being the government.

The demands from the opposition and the US are to hold new elections, and according to those familiar with the May talks, they say the Maduro government signaled a willingness to hold an election in 9-12 months, assuming it would end the persistent US regime change attempts.

That Maduro was willing for a new vote is surprising, and he might see it as a way out, since the US-backed opposition didn’t run in the 2018 election at all, which led them and the US to declare the vote illegitimate.

It’s also interesting that the US was involved at all, as the US expressed anger at the very idea of the Norway talks at the time, and chided Norway for having them. Now, officials say the US has opened up secret lines of communications with a number of members of Maduro’s inner circle.

The secret US talks don’t seem directly related to the secret Norway election proposal, but rather to the already failed US coup attempt, as the US is still trying to convince Venezuela’s leadership they won’t face further retribution if they betray Maduro and allow regime change.

The US inclination to have regime change just happen unilaterally based on a demand seems intact, related to Trump’s talk of a naval blockade of the entire, large country. It’s not clear where that leaves the election as of right now, though the US may ultimately view a proper election as a very last resort kind of idea.",Maduro Government Showed ‘Willingness’ for New Elections During Secret Talks,politics,election,273

1023514,thetelegraph,"Forget Brexit, the one thing guaranteed to elicit the strongest opinions during the first week of January is the debate over which day to take down your Christmas tree and decorations. Is it Sunday 5 January, or Monday 6 January? And what happens if you leave them up for longer? Are you really struck down with bad luck for the rest of the year as the superstition goes?

One thing's for sure - everyone does it differently, and everyone has their own ideas.

In Britain, tradition has it that Christmas decorations stay up until Twelfth Night.

And this is where the confusion lies. Twelfth Night is a festival in some branches of Christianity which marks the beginning of Epiphany. A count of exactly 12 days from 25 December arrives at 5 January. According to the Church of England, this day is Twelfth Night. The day of Epiphany – when the three wise men came – is the day after, on 6 January.

Not everyone agrees however. Many other Christian groups count the 12 days of Christmas as starting the day after Christmas Day – making 6 January the Twelfth Night. Countries which also follow the January 6 tradition include Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic.

So which date is correct?

227964,globalresearch,"There is a sad disregard for human life among the neocon regime-changers. The devastation of Iraq, with its million dead, was a mere stepping stone to a “re-making” of the Middle East. A Libya turned into a modern day slave market after neocon-backed “liberation” is off the radar screen. Who cares, right?

Syria suffered a half million dead after a US backed jihadist insurgency – strongly backed by the neocons – and not a word of remorse.

In fact, in a remarkable act of chutzpah, neocons have taken to blaming the victims in Syria, with the Washington Post’s Josh Rogin branding Assad, who fought and ultimately defeated US-backed terrorists (and in so doing saved Syria’s ancient Christian community) an “enemy of humanity.” One need not join the Assad fan club to come to the easy conclusion that an al-Qaeda-controlled Aleppo, for example, was a living hell while an Aleppo liberated by Assad very soon was on its feet again as a multi-confessional and multi-cultural center of Syria.

The sick disregard for human life as Washington gins up the regime change machine is on display again, bolder and more sadistic than ever. Witness the neoconservative Senator from Florida, shown above, who Tweeted this week that as hunger is growing in Venezuela, that country’s military must make a choice whether to support the US-backed overthrow of its government or allow the people to starve. Clearly threatening war, Rubio wrote, “military leaders should make a choice, before a choice is made for them.”

Other neocons behind this regime change operation are showing signs of desperation as after more than a week of their backing the US-selected “interim president” – who had never run for the office – there are not yet any major signs of the Maduro government crumbling under the pressure.

National Security Advisor John Bolton, who has spearheaded this idiotic operation (as he helped spearhead the idiotic 2003 invasion of Iraq), is almost begging the Venezuelan military to change sides. He is no doubt frustrated that the “cake walk” he likely promised Trump is to this point looking like no such thing.

Translation: “Want some money? Help us overthrow your government!”

The cynicism goes even deeper than that, however. After supporting the most brutal and aggressive sanctions against Venezuela for years – a policy that no doubt contributed to the misery they now pretend to seek to ameliorate – the regime changers are now dangling US “humanitarian” aid in front of Venezuelans if only they come over to the pro-rebel side and help overthrow their government.

A US convoy of “humanitarian” relief trucks has set out in Colombia all the way to the Venezuelan border. After trying to starve Venezuelans for years, suddenly the US government dangles food in front of them. For a price.

But the US “aid” convoy to Venezuela was so obviously a political move to use food as a weapon that even the UN and other NGOs refused to take part in the charade. Unsurprisingly, the Venezuelan government did not allow the US convoy to enter its territory and deliver aid to any rebels that might be eager to receive it.

Another example of how paranoid and unstable the Venezuelan government really is? No, actually just a couple of days earlier another “aid” shipment was found to contain a cache of weapons slated for delivery to the rebels.

Maybe they were just “moderate” rebels”?

You don’t believe the US government would make such a dishonest and dangerous move as to hide a cache of weapons inside a “humanitarian” aid shipment? Ha! For Bolton and his new/old comrade in charge of regime change in Venezuela, Elliot Abrams, this was a return to the “good old days” where such practice was all in a day’s work.

As an article in the 1987 Los Angeles Times informs us:

Boltlon, Abrams, and the rest of Trump’s neocons aren’t even trying to make this original. They have pulled the old 1980s “support Latin American dictators” playbook off the shelf and are blatantly plagiarizing themselves! And the tens of thousands of innocent dead littering the scorched earth of their murderous policies? Don’t expect an apology: they are panting for more death and destruction!

The US “aid” convoy to Venezuela was a farce from the beginning. Delivering humanitarian aid was the last thing on the neocon mind. Much more important was to deliver a message. And thanks to the slavishly compliant mainstream media in the US and among its allies, that message was amplified to all corners of the globe. As German government mouthpiece Deutsche Welle put it, “Maduro rejects humanitarian aid as nation starves.”

Score that headline a major win for the CIA and other psy-op masters.

Except unlike in Yemen, where the Germans and other “allies” back the US and Saudi genocide of the population amidst plenty of concrete evidence of horrific starvation, there is no evidence of anything remotely resembling a Yemen-like starvation nightmare in Venezuela. If there was, we’d see it in full livid detail. And again, Yemen doesn’t count because it’s the US and its allies doing the starving and blocking the humanitarian relief.

The neocons still have not broken up the Venezuelan government but they are not out of weapons. Secretary of State and top neocon dog Mike Pompeo may be about to go nuclear. In the face of a stalled regime change Pompeo came out yesterday with the outlandish claim that the Venezuela is now a central battle ground in the “War on Terror”! He told FoxNews’ Trish Regan that Venezuela is full of “active Hezbollah cells.” And that, “The Iranians are impacting the people of Venezuela and throughout South America.”

He added, ominously: “We have an obligation to take down that risk for America.”

Having over decades established Hezbollah as the ultimate bogeyman (despite their not targeting Americans or the US and in fact being primarily focused against Israeli expansionism and aggression), the neocons are now doing their best to use raw fear of terrorism to motivate Americans to support a US invasion of Venezuela.

And if Americans are not sufficiently propagandized that the Venezuelan government is the new Hitler and must be deposed before it throws more babies from incubators and distributes more Viagra to its troops? Breitbart is always good for a few low-IQ chunks of red meat to the feverish masses. Today they breathlessly report – PROOF of the depravity of Maduro – that…”Nicholas Maduro Threatens to Kill American Troops if They Invade Venezuela.”

What a revelation! Has there been country in history that actually welcomed a hostile invasion?

What is next for Venezuela and the neocon regime change plan? Well it is not going to plan at present, but as with all of these operations it is the neocons holding the cards (and the cash). The “correlation of forces” are definitely on their side. The neocon regime changers must only hit the target once, while the legitimate government of Venezuela must parry each blow.

As for the obligatory disclaimer (this is getting tedious): No, we do not “support” Maduro or socialism or all the really bad things he is accused of in Venezuela. Our opposition is as American patriots: We do not want a global US empire that arrogates to itself the authority to decide who is and who is not acceptable to govern a foreign country. No sanctions, no meddling, no “regime change”. A sound defense of this country and a passionate dedication to leading not by force or subterfuge, but by example.

The neocons have been given carte blanche by a seemingly lazy or uninterested President Trump. Will we rise to the occasion and defend real American values against their obsessive, failed attempts to conquer the globe? Will we hold our representatives in Congress accountable to real American values? There is some wavering in Congress about an implied authorization for the use of force in Venezuela. It is a unique opportunity for us to make our preferences known in a way that might make a difference. What do you say? It’s not that hard.

83537,cbsnews,"The Trump administration is no fan of big tech companies. But a recent decision from its Department of Labor could give a long-term boost to tech giants like Uber, Lyft and the soon-to-go-public Postmates.

These companies -- and many like them -- rely on a wide pool of on-demand workers who sign up through the companies' platforms to drive cars, make deliveries, run errands, walk dogs or clean houses. Many people doing this work disagree with the companies' assertion that they're not employees, but rather solo small-business proprietors using the platform of choice to perform their cleaning (or driving, or delivery) business.

Now the Department of Labor has weighed in, with an opinion letter stating that an on-demand company that appears to provide a cleaning service is correct to classify its workers as independent contractors rather than employees. The decision adds more heft to behemoths like Uber and Lyft and house-cleaning company Handy, all of which face lawsuits accusing them of wrongly classifying workers as independent contractors.

""For that particular company, the letter is sort of a get-out-of-jail-free card,"" said Maya Pinto, a senior researcher at the National Employment Law Project. ""It will be used by this one company and could prod other companies to get similar letters. We believe in most cases, if not all cases, the workers are under control of the company and are in fact employees,"" she said.

Handy, which wasn't named in the letter, is ""a virtual marketplace company that ""operates in the so-called 'on-demand' or 'sharing' economy,'"" the DOL wrote. The marketplace requires workers' name, email and Social Security number to sign them up. It connects them with customers who pay on a per-job basis, and it provides training materials that workers can choose to review or not. The app does allow customers to rate workers and removes workers after they haven't been ""active"" for some time.

A key reason the DOL cited for its decision is that the workers on Handy's platform have a great deal of control. The platform itself doesn't require a minimum of cleaning jobs, allows the workers to sign up with competitor apps or to work directly with customers, and it allows workers to sometimes ask for higher pay than the platform sets.

That's substantially different from Uber and Lyft drivers, whose rates are determined by the companies' ever-shifting policies and who are liable to get thrown off the platform once their customer rating dips below about 4.3 stars. Lyft, which went public recently, faces six class actions and ""thousands"" of individual actions accusing it of misclassifying employees, it told the Securities and Exchange Commission. Uber faces two such lawsuits, according to securities filings. Handy has been sued five times by workers.

""If workers are misclassified as independent contractors, and [a] court were to find they're employees, the employer could be responsible for back pay, overtime and minimum-wage violations and record-keeping violations. There could be [family and medical leave] implications, tax implications, workers' compensation implications,"" said Susan Harthill, a partner at Morgan Lewis, representing employers. ""Classification is a big concern for all businesses.""

The nature of ""platform"" work can sometimes create a truly gray area on the employee-contractor spectrum. But the cost difference between paying a employee and an independent contractor is so large, companies often choose to err in their favor while the decisions are fought out in court, saving themselves potentially millions of dollars. (A study last year on ride-hail drivers in New York found that if Uber considered its drivers employees, it would be the largest employer in the city.)

In exchange for freedom and flexibility, independent contractors give up most benefits that employees get, such as paid sick time, family leave, overtime or minimum-wage laws, and the right to start or join a union. That tradeoff often hits lowest-paid workers the hardest, labor advocates say.

""Where we see misclassification of workers is a lot of low-wage jobs that have a service sector aspect, or in construction, where companies have a lot of workers and they're trying to cut costs,"" said NELP's general counsel, Catherine Ruckelshaus. ""But the gig companies have made this a key part of their profitability.""",Labor Department says gig workers aren't employees,labour,employment legislation,683
468232,rferl,"The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) says it had cleared 21 Russian athletes to compete in coming international competitions -- albeit not under their national flag.

 

 The world governing body for track and field’s doping review board ruled that the 21 Russians have met ""exceptional eligibility criteria"" to compete as neutral athletes in 2019, a statement said on February 21.

 

 In January, the IAAF had already approved 42 Russian athletes to compete under a neutral flag this year.

 

 Athletics' governing body banned Russia in November 2015 after a report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency outlined evidence of systematic, state-backed doping in Russian athletics.

 

 Another report a year later documented more than 1,000 doping cases across dozens of sports, most notably at the Winter Olympics that Russia hosted in the Black Sea resort of Sochi in 2014.

 

 Russian athletes have had to meet strict criteria such as undergoing regular doping tests outside Russia in order to be allowed compete as neutrals.",IAAF Allows More Russian Athletes To Compete As Neutrals,sport,sport organisation,167
